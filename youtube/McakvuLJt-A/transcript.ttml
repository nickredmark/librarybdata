<p begin="00:02:42.129" end="00:02:46.299" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.019" end="00:02:49.299" style="s2">nice and tight opening paragraphs there</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.299" end="00:02:51.459" style="s2">so I wonder me if to begin with you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.299" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">could tell our listeners a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.459" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">about yourself and what your interests</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:03:00.670" style="s2">are and perhaps what motivated you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:02.590" style="s2">co-author this article right right first</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.670" end="00:03:04.540" style="s2">off I think I am gonna hire you to read</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.590" end="00:03:08.829" style="s2">the audio book if it ever gets released</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.540" end="00:03:12.519" style="s2">so yeah I appreciate that about myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.829" end="00:03:14.680" style="s2">so I organized this group called</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.519" end="00:03:19.180" style="s2">intellectual Explorers Club here in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.680" end="00:03:22.989" style="s2">Toronto and it&#39;s kind of a group that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:27.130" style="s2">meant to explore ideas with maximum</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.989" end="00:03:29.889" style="s2">charity and kind of expand our current</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.130" end="00:03:33.549" style="s2">map of reality right and how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.889" end="00:03:37.150" style="s2">we engage in book clubs debates lectures</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.549" end="00:03:39.489" style="s2">and just have kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.150" end="00:03:40.810" style="s2">spitballing type conversations and put</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.489" end="00:03:42.819" style="s2">ourselves at the edge of our thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.810" end="00:03:45.370" style="s2">because that&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.819" end="00:03:47.139" style="s2">scintillating activity for myself is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.370" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">put myself at the edge of my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.139" end="00:03:52.209" style="s2">and it really was sort of started off as</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.510" end="00:03:54.250" style="s2">a selfish project for me to create this</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.209" end="00:03:55.540" style="s2">group because I took philosophy and when</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.250" end="00:03:57.549" style="s2">I was a university student and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.540" end="00:03:59.590" style="s2">hungered to get this intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.549" end="00:04:02.160" style="s2">engagement back in my life so I created</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.590" end="00:04:04.090" style="s2">these this group but then it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.160" end="00:04:10.389" style="s2">transcended that purpose a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.090" end="00:04:12.430" style="s2">and inspired me to engage in I guess</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.389" end="00:04:14.200" style="s2">collective sense making because when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.430" end="00:04:16.389" style="s2">was the host and facilitator of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.200" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">these groups know when I still happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.389" end="00:04:19.630" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:22.030" style="s2">there&#39;s just fragmented kind of almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.630" end="00:04:23.289" style="s2">schizophrenic feeling I get because all</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.030" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">these people are just shouting their</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.289" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">reality tunnels their ideologies or</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:29.420" style="s2">philosophies and I&#39;m trying to contain</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.280" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">it all and at the same time to still</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.420" end="00:04:33.110" style="s2">a dialogue to get everyone sort of level</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:36.440" style="s2">set of what we&#39;re doing here what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.110" end="00:04:38.540" style="s2">talking about mm-hmm and that experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.440" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">of being a host and facilitator at these</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.540" end="00:04:43.400" style="s2">in-person clubs inspired me</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:45.170" style="s2">partly to write this paper and my</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.400" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">co-author Connor Barnes we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.170" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">geeked out on the political culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:52.400" style="s2">where stuff for a while now yeah and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:54.170" style="s2">recognize there&#39;s like multiple what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.400" end="00:04:56.480" style="s2">called mimetic tribes or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.170" end="00:04:58.700" style="s2">different ways to review a view culture</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:05:00.500" style="s2">and reality not just what it is but what</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.700" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">it should be um</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.500" end="00:05:04.940" style="s2">and what we dubbed culture war 1.0 it</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:06.410" style="s2">was sort of had this notion that all</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.940" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a left and then there&#39;s a right</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.410" end="00:05:11.240" style="s2">and then they&#39;re fighting each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:14.450" style="s2">yeah and I think that&#39;s a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:16.550" style="s2">simplistic of a narrative yes well and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.450" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">so we&#39;ve moved on to culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.550" end="00:05:20.510" style="s2">where we have a whole bunch of competing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:23.420" style="s2">tribes which are calling mean tribes or</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.510" end="00:05:26.530" style="s2">is it mimetic tribes which is a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.420" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">partial word for mean tribe of course</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.530" end="00:05:32.360" style="s2">but yeah and look that seems appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">and that seems fitting I think how many</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.360" end="00:05:35.750" style="s2">what percentage of human beings and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.310" style="s2">you have to pull this figure completely</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.750" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">out of nowhere of course what percentage</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.310" end="00:05:42.740" style="s2">of human beings consume memes on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">basis it&#39;s like it&#39;s a good but if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.740" end="00:05:46.010" style="s2">have access to a screen you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">essentially consuming memes all day long</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.010" end="00:05:49.840" style="s2">and and that memes in the in the graphic</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:54.740" style="s2">type we of course know and love memes</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">meaning ideas or perhaps what like ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.740" end="00:06:02.630" style="s2">that are that that sort of create or are</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:04.550" style="s2">part of your sense making lens that</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.630" end="00:06:06.920" style="s2">replicate themselves of course are more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.550" end="00:06:08.990" style="s2">ubiquitous phenomenon and our part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.920" end="00:06:11.180" style="s2">the sort of frameworks we use to make</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.990" end="00:06:14.120" style="s2">sense of the world so we&#39;ve moved on to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:17.630" style="s2">culture Ward 2.0 how would you say</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.120" end="00:06:23.720" style="s2">that&#39;s defined in contrast to culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.630" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">war 1.0 right so I think the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:31.310" style="s2">culture war 1.0 which was prevalent in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">the the early 90s with the pati</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.310" end="00:06:36.340" style="s2">Buckhannon and the idea of the religious</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:38.660" style="s2">right trying to kind of impose a</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.660" end="00:06:43.160" style="s2">narrative on the American culture and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.430" end="00:06:44.840" style="s2">being pushed back by the secular left</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.160" end="00:06:47.660" style="s2">so there is this idea that there was to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.840" end="00:06:51.800" style="s2">a left and a right competing with each</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.660" end="00:06:53.480" style="s2">other but I imagined there was it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.800" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">fragmented as well but it just wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.480" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">salient given the media landscape at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:02.390" style="s2">time yes but thanks thanks to the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">internet were sort of like exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.390" end="00:07:07.460" style="s2">all these ideas mm-hmm and I really like</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">the metaphor of the the noosphere like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:11.870" style="s2">viewing kind of the at least the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.810" style="s2">infrastructure and the hardware of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.870" end="00:07:16.220" style="s2">Internet as a brain and then the content</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.810" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">that&#39;s floating around it the means that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.220" end="00:07:20.510" style="s2">are flowing and floating around in it as</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:22.370" style="s2">this big collective mind yes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.510" end="00:07:24.680" style="s2">currently this collective mind is</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.370" end="00:07:28.100" style="s2">fragmented its disagreement is combative</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.680" end="00:07:29.480" style="s2">all that type of stuff yeah and so I</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.100" end="00:07:31.730" style="s2">guess that&#39;s the answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.480" end="00:07:34.570" style="s2">the key distinction is sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.730" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">fragmentation is more salient now and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.570" end="00:07:39.290" style="s2">when people on the Left just call</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.180" style="s2">everyone like you know everyone&#39;s a Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.290" end="00:07:42.800" style="s2">or this but if you kind of zoom in on</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.180" end="00:07:45.740" style="s2">that container of what some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.800" end="00:07:46.850" style="s2">consider the right there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.740" end="00:07:48.590" style="s2">good disagreement amongst all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.850" end="00:07:50.270" style="s2">different kind of segments they might</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.590" end="00:07:51.410" style="s2">have broad coalition and they have might</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.270" end="00:07:53.390" style="s2">have broad agreement but their</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.410" end="00:07:56.540" style="s2">infighting may be more so than they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.390" end="00:07:58.340" style="s2">out fighting right yeah of course yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.540" end="00:08:00.440" style="s2">one of the particular invites you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.340" end="00:08:02.300" style="s2">mentioned is between the alt-right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.440" end="00:08:04.670" style="s2">the old light so that all right of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.300" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">course don&#39;t like the old light for</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.380" end="00:08:26.990" style="s2">well there typifies by that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.780" end="00:08:31.190" style="s2">ethno nationalist tendency and they take</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.990" end="00:08:34.400" style="s2">that ethnic group identity very</p>

<p begin="00:08:34.400" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">else is some mixture of terrifying and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:46.070" style="s2">incorrect or at least irrelevant when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:48.940" style="s2">comes to genuinely partitioning or</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.070" end="00:08:51.080" style="s2">recognizing the value in human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.940" end="00:08:52.760" style="s2">and of course they don&#39;t like the old</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.860" end="00:09:02.870" style="s2">which is of course we see a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.810" end="00:09:05.450" style="s2">we see on the left as well and someone</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.870" end="00:09:08.000" style="s2">like christina hoff sommers identifying</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.450" end="00:09:10.220" style="s2">as a feminist getting absolutely railed</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.340" end="00:09:20.360" style="s2">was received very poorly too many jeers</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.680" end="00:09:42.050" style="s2">know feminists that from a broad-brush</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.980" end="00:09:44.600" style="s2">you would take as part of the same tribe</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.050" end="00:09:46.430" style="s2">but certainly aren&#39;t of course and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.600" end="00:09:49.370" style="s2">have fights between the intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.430" end="00:09:52.490" style="s2">feminists and other kinds of feminists</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.370" end="00:09:54.890" style="s2">so we have this fracturing and I have</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.490" end="00:09:56.750" style="s2">this this definition here of memetic</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.890" end="00:09:59.000" style="s2">tribes that you give in the article and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.750" end="00:10:02.420" style="s2">you define mimetic tribes as a group of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.000" end="00:10:04.820" style="s2">agents with amine complex mean flex that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.420" end="00:10:07.160" style="s2">directly seeks to impose its distinct</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.160" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">imperatives on others right and the goal</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.700" end="00:10:16.430" style="s2">is to win the culture war or at least</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:18.500" style="s2">not to lose so an important change you</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.430" end="00:10:20.330" style="s2">might say open if it&#39;s not a change just</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.500" end="00:10:22.190" style="s2">a bringing to articulations something</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.330" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">that might always have been the case to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.190" end="00:10:27.350" style="s2">some degree amongst human beings which</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:31.130" style="s2">is that rather than just a political</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.350" end="00:10:34.250" style="s2">position there are immediate moral</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.130" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">imperatives moral attitudes associated</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.250" end="00:10:38.870" style="s2">and moral judgments associated with your</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:41.000" style="s2">identification to any one of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.870" end="00:10:42.350" style="s2">tribes which is one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.000" end="00:10:44.210" style="s2">makes conversation really really</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.350" end="00:10:46.550" style="s2">difficult because as soon as you get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.210" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">little trigger that someone belongs to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.550" end="00:10:50.000" style="s2">this tribe or that tribe whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">the color of their hair or who they</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.000" end="00:10:54.110" style="s2">listen to on a podcast all of a sudden I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:56.750" style="s2">presume something even physiological</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.110" end="00:10:58.790" style="s2">happens you know you maybe get flood of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.750" end="00:11:00.890" style="s2">this sympathetic response in the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.790" end="00:11:04.820" style="s2">system and it&#39;s like oh shit this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.890" end="00:11:07.970" style="s2">motherfucker like I went into a bar the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.820" end="00:11:09.620" style="s2">other day where we recorded an event a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.970" end="00:11:11.300" style="s2">conversation which will be out soon</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.620" end="00:11:12.560" style="s2">I went back in there to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.300" end="00:11:14.270" style="s2">manager and thanked him and asked if I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.560" end="00:11:15.890" style="s2">could use his voice but appeared quit</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.270" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">and they were like yeah when you put</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.890" end="00:11:18.620" style="s2">this event on that was a thing that did</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:21.380" style="s2">it for him and he quit after that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.620" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">that is that joke I&#39;m not sure if it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.380" end="00:11:27.620" style="s2">but anyway this this um you know lady</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:29.630" style="s2">behind the bar was wearing a t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.620" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">that was down with the patriarchy or</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.630" end="00:11:32.840" style="s2">something like this and we had a nice</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:34.760" style="s2">interaction but then I mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.840" end="00:11:37.280" style="s2">t-shirt you know and I was thinking what</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.760" end="00:11:40.100" style="s2">tone of voice do I need to use here so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.280" end="00:11:42.350" style="s2">can mention the patriarchy or something</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.100" end="00:11:44.840" style="s2">like this without it causing like some</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.350" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">kind of attrition that would stop her</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.840" end="00:11:50.690" style="s2">stop this interaction and I said well</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:53.000" style="s2">what comes after the patriarchy but you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.690" end="00:11:55.370" style="s2">know I have a private-school accent from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.000" end="00:11:56.960" style="s2">England so generally speaking if I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.370" end="00:11:59.180" style="s2">to say something like what comes off the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.960" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">patriarchy it might be understood as</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.180" end="00:12:03.050" style="s2">some kind of conflict you know and she</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:05.030" style="s2">turned away and there was he felt like</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.050" end="00:12:06.230" style="s2">that little bit of tension there and she</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.030" end="00:12:08.570" style="s2">wasn&#39;t willing to continue the</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.230" end="00:12:16.250" style="s2">interaction so you have to find some</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.570" end="00:12:20.030" style="s2">ways of of bridging or speaking to ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.250" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">of relating to someone who might be very</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.030" end="00:12:25.250" style="s2">very critical of someone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:28.070" style="s2">let&#39;s say embody the right memes present</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.250" end="00:12:29.840" style="s2">the right memes to be taken as part of</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.070" end="00:12:32.570" style="s2">the tribe so that you can have a certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.840" end="00:12:34.580" style="s2">kind of conversation now interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.570" end="00:12:36.890" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ve identified the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.580" end="00:12:43.340" style="s2">kinds of people who wish to do this as</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.890" end="00:12:45.800" style="s2">having their own tribe is that right in</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.340" end="00:12:47.720" style="s2">the article we written or I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.800" end="00:12:50.450" style="s2">not showing that article I think later</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.720" end="00:12:53.030" style="s2">like I&#39;m interested in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.450" end="00:12:54.230" style="s2">labeling of it&#39;s the metagame I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.030" end="00:12:56.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve got they&#39;ve got a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.230" end="00:13:00.470" style="s2">memetic mediators right right but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.960" end="00:13:03.590" style="s2">wonder if yeah I mean what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.470" end="00:13:05.030" style="s2">I suppose is some network of people</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.590" end="00:13:08.690" style="s2">emerge who are willing to have these</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.030" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">kinds of conversations and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.690" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">you got to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:15.800" style="s2">I suppose that it doesn&#39;t become a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">of its own in some sense although maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.800" end="00:13:20.780" style="s2">it&#39;s not such a big deal right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:22.580" style="s2">wanna I definitely want to double click</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.780" end="00:13:23.450" style="s2">on the metagame but to briefly circle</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.580" end="00:13:25.310" style="s2">back on that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.450" end="00:13:28.280" style="s2">dorium down with the patriarchy sure sir</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.310" end="00:13:30.050" style="s2">sure that that person was wearing just</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.280" end="00:13:32.090" style="s2">to share my own similar story when I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.050" end="00:13:34.640" style="s2">in a coffee shop recently there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.090" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">girl she had this tattoo said that God</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.640" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">is a girl right and then I said hey uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:41.930" style="s2">how come guard God is not a woman right</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.460" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">I said that that&#39;s kind of a playful</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.930" end="00:13:47.660" style="s2">little yeah that&#39;s good and then she and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">then she thought like oh I thought you</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.660" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">were going to say why God&#39;s not a man</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:52.040" style="s2">and I was gonna be like ooh and then she</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.450" end="00:13:53.990" style="s2">got really kind of like angry right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.040" end="00:13:57.050" style="s2">but in that in also in a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.990" end="00:13:59.150" style="s2">subtly playful way and then and then I</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.050" end="00:14:01.100" style="s2">got my my coffee then I&#39;m like you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.150" end="00:14:02.750" style="s2">what - Timm choir into that why should</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.100" end="00:14:05.750" style="s2">you assume that I was going to say God</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.750" end="00:14:06.560" style="s2">is a man right and and then so I engaged</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.750" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">in sort of like a meta communication</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.560" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">about the communication that just</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:11.720" style="s2">occurred and we actually had like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:13.370" style="s2">really great conversations like huh I</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.720" end="00:14:14.450" style="s2">did I don&#39;t know why that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.370" end="00:14:16.670" style="s2">first thing that came to my head and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">then we just kind of engaged further and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.670" end="00:14:24.170" style="s2">we had a good chat and I like this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:26.660" style="s2">of meta communication and this lends</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.170" end="00:14:30.080" style="s2">itself is mitigating the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.660" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">can kind of step out of sort of the game</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.080" end="00:14:33.500" style="s2">that you&#39;re playing the finite game that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:34.910" style="s2">you&#39;re playing and then see all the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.500" end="00:14:37.010" style="s2">other type of finite games and have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.910" end="00:14:40.430" style="s2">conversation about it in a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.010" end="00:14:42.020" style="s2">non-judgmental way yes yes no I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.430" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">that&#39;s I think that&#39;s an excellent idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.020" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">and you know on the ground level that</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:53.810" style="s2">takes a lot of I would say skill when it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.120" end="00:14:56.660" style="s2">comes to being able to identify what are</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.810" end="00:14:58.700" style="s2">the trigger points really for people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.660" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">their particular mean plexes but in</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.700" end="00:15:02.930" style="s2">another sense and and I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:05.840" style="s2">approach things like that when I when I</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.930" end="00:15:07.940" style="s2">get about and talk to people I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.840" end="00:15:10.430" style="s2">switch out which I do quite a lot and</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.940" end="00:15:12.170" style="s2">and in fact I actually have an event</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.430" end="00:15:14.120" style="s2">coming up I haven&#39;t put it online yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.170" end="00:15:16.130" style="s2">but the posters are up at the venue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.120" end="00:15:19.700" style="s2">not going to be recorded and it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.130" end="00:15:21.950" style="s2">to be a step into trying to be this role</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.700" end="00:15:23.630" style="s2">of I can say it to you I wouldn&#39;t I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.950" end="00:15:25.220" style="s2">not going to say it out loud exactly to</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.630" end="00:15:29.150" style="s2">people at the event of you trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.220" end="00:15:31.700" style="s2">a memetic mediator here but between you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.150" end="00:15:33.880" style="s2">and I and our listeners I suppose we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.700" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">be having this event titled ego self</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.880" end="00:15:38.750" style="s2">masculinity and femininity</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:41.510" style="s2">together a panel of people and I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.750" end="00:15:43.850" style="s2">have a wireless mic and can try and set</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.510" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">up the space of this bar so that there</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.850" end="00:15:48.680" style="s2">is sort of a circular facing or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.460" end="00:15:50.779" style="s2">kind of like a long rectangle but people</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.680" end="00:15:52.850" style="s2">sitting on the perimeter be having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.779" end="00:15:54.710" style="s2">conversation and an interactive forum</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:56.779" style="s2">just having people express what</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.710" end="00:15:59.990" style="s2">masculinity and femininity mean to them</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.779" end="00:16:02.300" style="s2">and to attempt to create this container</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.990" end="00:16:05.529" style="s2">where it is about this Co exploration</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.300" end="00:16:08.210" style="s2">where most importantly what is valued</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.529" end="00:16:10.760" style="s2">well a few a few things are valued but</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.210" end="00:16:12.920" style="s2">but one important thing for our purposes</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.760" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">right now is the belief in the dignity</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.920" end="00:16:17.630" style="s2">of the human spirit just the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something fundamental about all</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.630" end="00:16:22.339" style="s2">of us that has value and it&#39;s at am this</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.320" style="s2">more fundamental existential perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.339" end="00:16:27.560" style="s2">even spiritual level where we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.320" end="00:16:30.350" style="s2">ultimately connected and where some</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.560" end="00:16:32.839" style="s2">important source of our value is derived</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.350" end="00:16:34.520" style="s2">from and and I think you know and I can</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.839" end="00:16:36.260" style="s2">speak a little bit about what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.520" end="00:16:37.520" style="s2">about that perhaps now or another time</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.260" end="00:16:40.010" style="s2">but but I think there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.520" end="00:16:41.570" style="s2">embodying that place of connection and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.010" end="00:16:44.140" style="s2">genuine goodwill towards other human</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.570" end="00:16:48.470" style="s2">beings like a real embodiment of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.140" end="00:16:50.210" style="s2">that I believe at least I hope in many</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.470" end="00:16:53.390" style="s2">cases certainly believe for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.210" end="00:16:55.730" style="s2">them that it&#39;s possible to conduct</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.390" end="00:17:00.410" style="s2">interactions from this place and have</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.730" end="00:17:03.230" style="s2">that be a way to I mean disarm might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.410" end="00:17:06.020" style="s2">a you know a functional word here but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.230" end="00:17:08.150" style="s2">certainly find some way to talk to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.020" end="00:17:12.350" style="s2">part in someone that&#39;s really willing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.150" end="00:17:16.670" style="s2">relate authentically and but</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.350" end="00:17:19.449" style="s2">nevertheless depending on when the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.670" end="00:17:22.760" style="s2">particulars of a given person and how</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.449" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">receptive they are for dialogue perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.760" end="00:17:26.120" style="s2">the state of their nervous system to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:29.150" style="s2">some degree you might have to really</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.120" end="00:17:32.150" style="s2">make sure not to tread on the wrong the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.150" end="00:17:33.910" style="s2">wrong land the wrong landmines and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.150" end="00:17:37.100" style="s2">you can begin this kind of discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.910" end="00:17:39.920" style="s2">but I think it&#39;s a really worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.100" end="00:17:42.170" style="s2">endeavor and I would invite everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.920" end="00:17:43.670" style="s2">listening right now to to follow you and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.170" end="00:17:45.560" style="s2">all the things you post about it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.670" end="00:17:47.960" style="s2">a couple other people in this network</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.560" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">who have got really good ideas and who</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.960" end="00:17:54.020" style="s2">are really tackling this question or</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:56.540" style="s2">of how to genuinely have effective</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.020" end="00:17:59.270" style="s2">meaningful conversations on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.540" end="00:18:01.130" style="s2">given the context of this culture war</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.270" end="00:18:03.170" style="s2">2.0 which is something we&#39;re really only</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.130" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">beginning to get to to grips with</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.170" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">in my opinion right right and I like</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:12.260" style="s2">that I like that idea that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:15.710" style="s2">that in-person event because I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.260" end="00:18:18.200" style="s2">that the topic of masculinity especially</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.710" end="00:18:20.630" style="s2">is is a trigger worthy on many fronts</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.200" end="00:18:21.790" style="s2">right right it&#39;s like I like the term</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.630" end="00:18:24.470" style="s2">that the meta modernist use a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.790" end="00:18:25.700" style="s2">philosophical allergies right and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.470" end="00:18:28.100" style="s2">we&#39;re toxic masculinity or just</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.700" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">masculine itself is such a such a word</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.100" end="00:18:33.260" style="s2">that has so much emotional weight into</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:36.580" style="s2">it so that&#39;s a good topic to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.260" end="00:18:38.990" style="s2">the medic mediation with and then just</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.580" end="00:18:41.540" style="s2">to touch on that point that you made</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.990" end="00:18:45.230" style="s2">about kind of the spirit of engagement</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:47.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s like you know you can get this</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.230" end="00:18:49.429" style="s2">would kind of separates mean what I</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.540" end="00:18:51.530" style="s2">think I&#39;m doing from sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.429" end="00:18:53.240" style="s2">the rationalist or the the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.530" end="00:18:54.590" style="s2">atheistic tribes how they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.240" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">concerned with the truth and objective</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.590" end="00:18:58.850" style="s2">truth and getting things right yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">think that is important but when it</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:03.940" style="s2">comes to dialogue I&#39;m more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">the act of understanding hmm all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.940" end="00:19:09.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like just shine a light on your map</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">of reality and just understand it as</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.200" end="00:19:12.950" style="s2">best as I can and I&#39;m probably gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.570" style="s2">it wrong I&#39;m probably gonna stumble it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.950" end="00:19:16.520" style="s2">probably gonna be messy but just that</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.570" end="00:19:18.620" style="s2">spirit of understanding I think people</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.520" end="00:19:19.700" style="s2">feel that and it&#39;s just arming and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.620" end="00:19:22.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay the fight-or-flight</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.700" end="00:19:24.920" style="s2">response is not being enacted right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.820" end="00:19:26.929" style="s2">yes person it means goodwill and this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.920" end="00:19:29.179" style="s2">type of talk yeah and I think regardless</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.929" end="00:19:30.620" style="s2">from my experience engaging with many</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.179" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">different people that are belong to</p>

<p begin="00:22:03.029" end="00:22:07.350" style="s2">the first thing is to get clear on</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.799" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">precisely where we are so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.350" end="00:22:11.940" style="s2">coming into that you know understanding</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:14.429" style="s2">and so then we might figure out and</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.940" end="00:22:15.779" style="s2">connect to yeah what is healthy and asks</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.429" end="00:22:18.749" style="s2">what is good in us</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.779" end="00:22:22.499" style="s2">can connect and imagine the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.749" end="00:22:25.289" style="s2">way that represents the world accurately</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.499" end="00:22:28.259" style="s2">enough so that effective decisions can</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.289" end="00:22:30.869" style="s2">be taken and executed within it and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.259" end="00:22:36.869" style="s2">must start with understanding I totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.869" end="00:22:39.090" style="s2">agree and the way you said there but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.869" end="00:22:40.649" style="s2">values and we listed on that white paper</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.090" end="00:22:42.570" style="s2">and that sort of that spreadsheet that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.649" end="00:22:43.859" style="s2">recommend your listeners check out the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.570" end="00:22:45.389" style="s2">spreadsheet that lists all the medic</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.859" end="00:22:47.940" style="s2">tribes and they&#39;re sort of like their</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.389" end="00:22:51.179" style="s2">taxonomy and then we said that we label</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.940" end="00:22:54.059" style="s2">it the sacred values right and and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.179" end="00:22:56.549" style="s2">think a lot of these in tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.059" end="00:22:58.769" style="s2">people it&#39;s like their sacred values are</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.549" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">always at threat and they&#39;re always like</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.769" end="00:23:03.089" style="s2">need to be ready to defend them mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:05.159" style="s2">and so if you shine a light and say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.089" end="00:23:06.869" style="s2">gonna understand your sacred value right</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.159" end="00:23:08.909" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s almost like an act of love on</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.869" end="00:23:10.379" style="s2">their sacred value yeah and then it sort</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.909" end="00:23:12.359" style="s2">of opens the door says you know what</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.379" end="00:23:14.070" style="s2">like I have a different sacred value and</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.359" end="00:23:15.869" style="s2">let&#39;s have a discussion about it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.070" end="00:23:17.639" style="s2">but sort of that that that move of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.869" end="00:23:19.950" style="s2">understanding and making sure you let</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.639" end="00:23:21.869" style="s2">the other person know you understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.950" end="00:23:25.019" style="s2">I think should come first if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.869" end="00:23:27.089" style="s2">have that dialogue to take place yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.019" end="00:23:30.389" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.089" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">critical so what I did yesterday is I</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.389" end="00:23:33.960" style="s2">took myself out and I went through that</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:38.899" style="s2">article and I went through some of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.960" end="00:23:38.899" style="s2">recent tweets and I have here a list of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.529" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">that&#39;s my fucking research so I have</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.559" end="00:23:49.649" style="s2">here a list of items that all of which I</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:54.509" style="s2">think we could discuss for quite some</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.649" end="00:23:57.389" style="s2">time and I think we&#39;ve set the stage now</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.509" end="00:24:00.320" style="s2">decently well enough I mean before I</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.389" end="00:24:02.759" style="s2">touched on any of these I might ask you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.320" end="00:24:05.399" style="s2">because I think how many mean tribes do</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.759" end="00:24:06.899" style="s2">you identify is it like 20 on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.399" end="00:24:08.549" style="s2">spreadsheet there&#39;s a lot right but then</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.899" end="00:24:11.219" style="s2">there&#39;s smaller main ones as more than</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.549" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">20 maybe even yeah I think there&#39;s 32</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.219" end="00:24:17.549" style="s2">that we listed but of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:19.969" style="s2">many more yeah that you know I got</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.549" end="00:24:22.769" style="s2">introduced to after writing that paper</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.969" end="00:24:23.970" style="s2">for example the meta modernists I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.769" end="00:24:26.429" style="s2">somewhat aware of them but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.970" end="00:24:27.869" style="s2">realize that they were bigger than they</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.429" end="00:24:29.220" style="s2">actually were and they really dig the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.869" end="00:24:29.850" style="s2">paper and they reached out to me so</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.220" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s one that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.850" end="00:24:36.210" style="s2">would include if I were to rewrite that</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:40.110" style="s2">but yeah we listed 32 yeah cool what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.210" end="00:24:45.990" style="s2">the most relevant ones for the current</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.110" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">war would you say who I would say the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.990" end="00:24:55.440" style="s2">social justice activists the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.200" end="00:24:59.160" style="s2">intellectual darkweb and maybe some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.440" end="00:25:02.760" style="s2">the the old right out light type tribes</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.160" end="00:25:04.919" style="s2">yeah you also have the the dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.760" end="00:25:07.140" style="s2">the establishment left and right as well</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.919" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">which play a very interesting role still</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.140" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">because you would say they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">that are pulling the reigns of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:14.610" style="s2">mainstream media and so really for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:19.110" style="s2">large percentage of the population and</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.610" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">still in some sense look if the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.110" end="00:25:24.390" style="s2">really was burning I would look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:27.630" style="s2">Reddit and then once reddit had</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.390" end="00:25:29.610" style="s2">basically convinced me I probably still</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.630" end="00:25:32.130" style="s2">I&#39;d still try and find a news article</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.610" end="00:25:35.669" style="s2">that was from one of the you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.130" end="00:25:38.610" style="s2">the mainstream media outlets and be like</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.669" end="00:25:40.020" style="s2">okay so I even though even though</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.610" end="00:25:41.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of criticism you know the</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.020" end="00:25:43.830" style="s2">mainstream media is dead and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.280" end="00:25:46.650" style="s2">what-have-you it&#39;s like there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.830" end="00:25:48.240" style="s2">something maybe for our generation I</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.650" end="00:25:51.690" style="s2">think part of our collective psyche</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.240" end="00:25:54.020" style="s2">still has a an affinity for these for</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.690" end="00:25:56.520" style="s2">these institutions and in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.020" end="00:25:58.710" style="s2">part of frustration I mean when you see</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.520" end="00:26:00.870" style="s2">people like Eric Weinstein he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.710" end="00:26:02.730" style="s2">tweeting recently you ever see him and</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.870" end="00:26:06.270" style="s2">Brett tweet all the time and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.730" end="00:26:08.030" style="s2">very much involved in saying things when</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.270" end="00:26:10.650" style="s2">there are particularly egregious</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.030" end="00:26:12.750" style="s2">articles written and published in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.650" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">big establishment institutions that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.750" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">would hope for more from whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:19.590" style="s2">The Economist or the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:22.230" style="s2">there&#39;s still this sense of many people</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.590" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">want to save what they see as a decline</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.230" end="00:26:30.289" style="s2">in institutional credibility so I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:33.030" style="s2">that establishment left/right mean tribe</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.289" end="00:26:34.409" style="s2">dichotomy there is still very relevant</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.030" end="00:26:36.840" style="s2">and I would say for people that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.409" end="00:26:40.200" style="s2">engage online as much or really take it</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.060" end="00:27:57.860" style="s2">fall into that category and and then you</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.850" end="00:28:41.180" style="s2">problems with capitalism we need some</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.500" end="00:28:42.800" style="s2">sort of hybrid and it falls more towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.180" end="00:28:44.150" style="s2">a socialist side and how dare you stop</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.800" end="00:28:45.680" style="s2">the conversation here because look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.150" end="00:28:47.690" style="s2">all this exploitation on the capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.680" end="00:28:49.220" style="s2">side of things and that&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.690" end="00:28:54.380" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very big</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.220" end="00:28:56.420" style="s2">tribe to so great and it&#39;s like I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.380" end="00:28:57.800" style="s2">you did a nice job of describing all</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.420" end="00:28:59.720" style="s2">this sort of fragment</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.800" end="00:29:01.820" style="s2">and all these reality tunnels that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.720" end="00:29:04.760" style="s2">sort of coexisting in this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.820" end="00:29:06.860" style="s2">noosphere and I like that ken wilber</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.760" end="00:29:09.700" style="s2">quote is that no one&#39;s smart enough to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.860" end="00:29:13.580" style="s2">be a hundred percent wrong right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.700" end="00:29:16.120" style="s2">even the the wildly conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.580" end="00:29:18.380" style="s2">conspiracy tribes like you went on right</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.120" end="00:29:20.390" style="s2">there like deeply looking at the deep</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.380" end="00:29:22.220" style="s2">state and nobody else is really looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.390" end="00:29:24.170" style="s2">at them as deep as they are yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.220" end="00:29:25.970" style="s2">might stumble on something that no one</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.170" end="00:29:27.620" style="s2">else is stumbling upon because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.970" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">looking at it yeah so such intensity</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.620" end="00:29:33.920" style="s2">yeah and so I kind of like the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">just kind of being charitable and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.920" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">first of all recognizing what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.020" style="s2">saying on their own terms and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:44.630" style="s2">what I could take from that yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.020" end="00:29:46.190" style="s2">know yeah yeah and then to mention the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.630" end="00:29:48.560" style="s2">whole kind of right left I caught a me</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.190" end="00:29:50.060" style="s2">and I should say with this article right</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.560" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">off the bat and then kind of any other</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.060" end="00:29:55.550" style="s2">mimetic artifacts that I intend to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:30:00.230" style="s2">create I&#39;m basing it off or I&#39;m inspired</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.550" end="00:30:02.030" style="s2">by the post rationalist there&#39;s tribe</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.230" end="00:30:04.580" style="s2">called the post rationalists and they</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.030" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">they kind of operate on this motto of</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.580" end="00:30:09.140" style="s2">it&#39;s better to be interesting and wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.440" end="00:30:10.940" style="s2">than right and boring right because</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.140" end="00:30:12.530" style="s2">being interesting and wrong sets up</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.940" end="00:30:15.620" style="s2">other people inspires other people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.530" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">pursue truth or rightness continue the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.620" end="00:30:19.910" style="s2">conversation guys continuing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:22.580" style="s2">infinite game of most of the public</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.910" end="00:30:24.530" style="s2">conversation keeping it alive and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.580" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">with this the white paper what we did</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.530" end="00:30:29.540" style="s2">called mimetic tribes and culture were</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:31.250" style="s2">2.0 which is the the crux premise there</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.540" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">is you know we&#39;re living in a fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.250" end="00:30:36.740" style="s2">culture war I&#39;m not to attach that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.810" style="s2">idea yes it&#39;s just sort of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.740" end="00:30:40.280" style="s2">enough that hasn&#39;t really been presented</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.810" end="00:30:41.810" style="s2">in the way we presented it that be</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.280" end="00:30:44.120" style="s2">created this this dialogue that it did</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.810" end="00:30:46.610" style="s2">around it but I do think there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.120" end="00:30:49.610" style="s2">of validity and a need for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.610" end="00:30:53.540" style="s2">like just general right left economy yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.610" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">and you know before the the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.540" end="00:30:57.380" style="s2">right left was like okay right was it</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">about small government left was big</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.380" end="00:31:01.910" style="s2">government and now they said it was like</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:05.090" style="s2">right it was about open borders closed</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.910" end="00:31:06.800" style="s2">borders which I don&#39;t think is you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.090" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">you can necessarily divide that to right</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.800" end="00:31:09.290" style="s2">or left because there&#39;s you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:10.950" style="s2">left-wing populist and right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.290" end="00:31:12.840" style="s2">populist</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.950" end="00:31:14.580" style="s2">but one thing that I find interesting at</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.840" end="00:31:17.130" style="s2">least in the culture war setting is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.580" end="00:31:18.630" style="s2">sort of what I like to label where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.130" end="00:31:21.480" style="s2">currently labeling the the woke</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.630" end="00:31:23.820" style="s2">coalition right right and the coalition</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.480" end="00:31:25.620" style="s2">consists of social justice activists</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.820" end="00:31:28.049" style="s2">which you know some people call the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.620" end="00:31:30.870" style="s2">social justice warriors black life</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.049" end="00:31:34.440" style="s2">matters me too and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.870" end="00:31:36.179" style="s2">coalition is what i when i&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.440" end="00:31:38.039" style="s2">dubbing that the red pill coalition</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.179" end="00:31:41.460" style="s2">right and this consists of the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.039" end="00:31:43.260" style="s2">the old lights the manosphere and all</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.460" end="00:31:46.289" style="s2">the masculine tribes and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.260" end="00:31:48.419" style="s2">this sort of like this the centrist</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.289" end="00:31:49.650" style="s2">intellectual darkweb sorters you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.419" end="00:31:51.659" style="s2">the optimists that they&#39;re kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.650" end="00:31:53.690" style="s2">in between this nebulous space they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.659" end="00:31:56.340" style="s2">trying to push back on both but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.690" end="00:31:58.380" style="s2">it&#39;s funny the the woke tribes view them</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.340" end="00:32:00.150" style="s2">as like a gateway drug to the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.380" end="00:32:01.860" style="s2">and the red pill tribes view them as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.150" end="00:32:03.690" style="s2">some useful 80s to this global</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.860" end="00:32:05.309" style="s2">conspiracy or whatever globalist</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.690" end="00:32:07.140" style="s2">conspiracy yeah so they&#39;re they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.309" end="00:32:09.539" style="s2">getting love from any of the sides but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.140" end="00:32:11.549" style="s2">view the culture whereas this woke</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.539" end="00:32:13.620" style="s2">coalition red pill coalition and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.549" end="00:32:15.390" style="s2">centrist in the middle yeah and I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.620" end="00:32:17.490" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s fair you know to say this</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.390" end="00:32:19.500" style="s2">is existing yeah and then what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.490" end="00:32:21.480" style="s2">flirting with this idea of flirting with</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.500" end="00:32:22.890" style="s2">is that maybe it&#39;s a political movement</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.480" end="00:32:24.240" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not but there&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.890" end="00:32:27.690" style="s2">have that spectrum that political</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.240" end="00:32:29.130" style="s2">spectrum of you know left woke red pill</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.690" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">right and then centrist in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.130" end="00:32:32.820" style="s2">then there&#39;s this meta category right</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:35.909" style="s2">above it floating above it right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.820" end="00:32:37.140" style="s2">the high book yeah yeah yeah and I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.909" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">you can you&#39;re you could have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.140" end="00:32:40.530" style="s2">temperament or you can have sacred</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:42.059" style="s2">values that maybe resonate with all kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.530" end="00:32:43.620" style="s2">of these buckets but then you could also</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.059" end="00:32:46.500" style="s2">be meta you can also be a meta gamer</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.620" end="00:32:47.970" style="s2">right it&#39;s almost like a liminal state a</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.500" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">cognitive liminal state that you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:52.440" style="s2">visit mm-hmm yeah cool well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.450" style="s2">meta game is great and look when I when</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.440" end="00:32:57.330" style="s2">I first came across your article I came</p>

<p begin="00:33:01.559" end="00:33:05.640" style="s2">and I&#39;d actually quite like to do a</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.570" end="00:33:07.409" style="s2">reading of that and release that as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.640" end="00:33:10.110" style="s2">because that&#39;s also another brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.409" end="00:33:12.230" style="s2">article and Jordan Hall I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.110" end="00:33:14.520" style="s2">recommend his writing on medium enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.230" end="00:33:16.350" style="s2">but when I when I read your article I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.520" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">was like this is really good</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.350" end="00:33:23.130" style="s2">this articulates things that are helpful</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:24.110" style="s2">and it sort of clued on to the memes of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.130" end="00:33:27.260" style="s2">the times</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.110" end="00:33:29.440" style="s2">but I did think you know there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.260" end="00:33:31.940" style="s2">gonna be a little disagreement about</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:34.790" style="s2">precisely what you&#39;re capturing in each</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.940" end="00:33:36.620" style="s2">category and some of them might be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.790" end="00:33:39.200" style="s2">you know does that qualify as a category</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.620" end="00:33:40.460" style="s2">and many of people of course belong to</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.200" end="00:33:42.140" style="s2">multiple and I know that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.460" end="00:33:44.210" style="s2">you&#39;d you know you wouldn&#39;t you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.140" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">reject a tool and so the point would</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.210" end="00:33:52.160" style="s2">just be something like yes we these are</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.480" style="s2">you know maybe only relatively few are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.160" end="00:33:54.950" style="s2">actually to be honest some of those some</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.480" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">of those categories are so big in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.950" end="00:33:58.580" style="s2">culture war is so entrenched that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">actually some people&#39;s identities do</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.580" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">seem to be almost entirely within one</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:06.470" style="s2">camp however even in that case these</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:08.619" style="s2">camps aren&#39;t fundamental categories of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.470" end="00:34:10.760" style="s2">human being right there are deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.619" end="00:34:14.179" style="s2">existential realities to what we are and</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.760" end="00:34:16.129" style="s2">and and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s very much a</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.179" end="00:34:18.530" style="s2">cultural political level of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.129" end="00:34:21.020" style="s2">that&#39;s important for to to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.530" end="00:34:23.270" style="s2">understand engage current cultural</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.020" end="00:34:25.490" style="s2">dialogue but the other thing is is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.270" end="00:34:28.010" style="s2">of course we we have these aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.490" end="00:34:29.570" style="s2">our sad are deeper and and crosscut with</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.010" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">the affinities of many of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.570" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s relating on that level that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.020" end="00:34:36.560" style="s2">well we sort of covered that before when</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.119" end="00:34:38.389" style="s2">it comes to understanding that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.560" end="00:34:41.720" style="s2">intellectual part of that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.389" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">what are your sacred memes but then</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.720" end="00:34:45.560" style="s2">there&#39;s also this dropping into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:47.840" style="s2">space and people talk about it as</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.560" end="00:34:50.090" style="s2">liminal space and I think that&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.840" end="00:34:51.950" style="s2">word I think there are other words do</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.090" end="00:34:54.010" style="s2">you use to describe it I&#39;d probably I</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.950" end="00:34:56.899" style="s2">probably prefer something slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.010" end="00:34:58.970" style="s2">existential II sort of poetically minded</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.899" end="00:35:01.700" style="s2">we can drop into this space of shared</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.970" end="00:35:03.380" style="s2">relationship with each other very much</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.700" end="00:35:05.840" style="s2">takes place in that moment there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.380" end="00:35:09.260" style="s2">that becomes and is the most real thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.840" end="00:35:11.000" style="s2">and we can we can we sort of intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.260" end="00:35:13.700" style="s2">map on these different kind of patterns</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.000" end="00:35:15.380" style="s2">that enable us to come into communion</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.700" end="00:35:18.350" style="s2">with each other in in more effective</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.380" end="00:35:20.930" style="s2">ways so I guess it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.350" end="00:35:23.900" style="s2">probably unnecessary to stress but in</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.930" end="00:35:25.940" style="s2">fact it let me stress it for us that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.900" end="00:35:28.130" style="s2">these aren&#39;t meant to these categories</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.940" end="00:35:30.760" style="s2">aren&#39;t meant to trap people in them you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.130" end="00:35:36.140" style="s2">know quite quite the contrary however</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.760" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">nevertheless the idea of the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.140" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">the metagame</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.640" end="00:35:44.119" style="s2">playing the metagame which I mean if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:46.250" style="s2">if I&#39;m getting you right to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.119" end="00:35:49.579" style="s2">other words would be something like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.250" end="00:35:52.670" style="s2">the capacity to recognize the the values</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.579" end="00:35:54.710" style="s2">in different tribes and to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.670" end="00:35:56.779" style="s2">other levels of analysis that look to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.710" end="00:35:58.549" style="s2">explain the rise of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.779" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">tribalistic phenomenon altogether so</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.549" end="00:36:02.630" style="s2">maybe taking evolutionary theory maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:05.089" style="s2">existential philosophical theory maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.630" end="00:36:07.510" style="s2">some kind of spiritual approach where</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.089" end="00:36:09.769" style="s2">you&#39;re looking to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.510" end="00:36:13.700" style="s2">proclivities within individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.769" end="00:36:15.019" style="s2">have them aligned with these different</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.700" end="00:36:17.569" style="s2">tribes not just proclivities within</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.019" end="00:36:19.880" style="s2">individuals but also conditions of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.569" end="00:36:22.220" style="s2">time and economic conditions of the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.880" end="00:36:23.869" style="s2">and technological changes of the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.220" end="00:36:26.029" style="s2">and different crises we&#39;re facing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.869" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">might put pressure on people to be part</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.029" end="00:36:31.609" style="s2">of one group or another and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:33.740" style="s2">is that in separating oneself from an</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.609" end="00:36:35.930" style="s2">affinity with one particular memeplex</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.740" end="00:36:38.750" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re able to recognize how</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.930" end="00:36:40.960" style="s2">those different parts of a fractured</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.750" end="00:36:46.369" style="s2">culture might actually be won</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.960" end="00:36:49.339" style="s2">maneuvering hole that is worthy of love</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.369" end="00:36:51.589" style="s2">in all its areas and worthy of tending</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.339" end="00:36:53.660" style="s2">to now something flagged up so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.589" end="00:36:54.980" style="s2">on a bit of a ramble here but like part</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.660" end="00:36:56.660" style="s2">of what flagged up there is like some</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.980" end="00:36:58.279" style="s2">people be like well what about those old</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.660" end="00:37:00.109" style="s2">right types are what about those real</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.279" end="00:37:02.420" style="s2">radical leftist communist types are they</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.109" end="00:37:04.549" style="s2">worthy of love too it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.420" end="00:37:06.259" style="s2">actually in some important sense they</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.549" end="00:37:08.839" style="s2">have to be that doesn&#39;t mean you endorse</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.259" end="00:37:10.730" style="s2">what their propositions are or endorse</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.839" end="00:37:14.089" style="s2">what their actions are like far from it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.730" end="00:37:16.579" style="s2">you can put a hard note to that but that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.089" end="00:37:19.400" style="s2">there is a human being to understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.579" end="00:37:21.740" style="s2">they&#39;re right that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.400" end="00:37:24.230" style="s2">about that proclivity and about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.740" end="00:37:27.200" style="s2">position in society that is reflective</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.230" end="00:37:29.269" style="s2">of a broader phenomenon that&#39;s that must</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.200" end="00:37:31.609" style="s2">be understood and so infants from an</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.269" end="00:37:33.890" style="s2">input importance sense must be related</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.609" end="00:37:36.529" style="s2">to it must be really held right must not</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.890" end="00:37:37.940" style="s2">just be forced away so that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.529" end="00:37:40.430" style="s2">paying attention to it and not really</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.940" end="00:37:43.039" style="s2">trying on to understand it yes you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.430" end="00:37:44.809" style="s2">to look at it with some sort of open</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.039" end="00:37:47.539" style="s2">mind so you can at least get clear on</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.809" end="00:37:49.519" style="s2">what the on what the current map is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.539" end="00:37:51.470" style="s2">we&#39;re working with otherwise how on</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.519" end="00:37:53.059" style="s2">earth could you hope to fit it too</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.470" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">the territory or what the territory</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.059" end="00:38:00.859" style="s2">should be mm-hmm it&#39;s like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:04.789" style="s2">threads that can go down there um you</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.859" end="00:38:08.410" style="s2">know I&#39;m currently flirting with a pen</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.789" end="00:38:10.609" style="s2">and theistic view of God right now and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.410" end="00:38:13.369" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the idea that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.609" end="00:38:16.099" style="s2">God is reality right and so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.369" end="00:38:17.869" style="s2">you love God and you love reality and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.099" end="00:38:21.410" style="s2">everything that reality consists of and</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.869" end="00:38:24.230" style="s2">then all these different individuals or</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.410" end="00:38:26.450" style="s2">these tribes they have a map of reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.230" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">right and so in a way understanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.450" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">their map of reality is loving that map</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:32.660" style="s2">of reality and not that&#39;s to say that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">your greeing with it or you think is</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.660" end="00:38:35.809" style="s2">accurate or you think it&#39;s right or</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:37.670" style="s2">moral or all that type of stuff but this</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.809" end="00:38:41.380" style="s2">is having putting some understanding to</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.670" end="00:38:44.210" style="s2">it I think is a useful useful exercise</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.380" end="00:38:47.299" style="s2">and sort of what I like is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.210" end="00:38:50.780" style="s2">having a map of maps right right so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.299" end="00:38:54.109" style="s2">is cultivating a map of all the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.780" end="00:38:55.430" style="s2">various maps of reality out there all</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.109" end="00:38:58.010" style="s2">right andin let&#39;s say if somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.430" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">truly evil or needs to be stopped you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.010" end="00:39:01.130" style="s2">know like it&#39;s like some soon like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:02.690" style="s2">know your enemy know yourself know your</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.130" end="00:39:04.369" style="s2">enemy but if you have this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.690" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">cartoonish version of your enemy you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.369" end="00:39:08.359" style="s2">don&#39;t really understand them then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:12.680" style="s2">can&#39;t really even effectively fight them</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.359" end="00:39:14.779" style="s2">mm-hmm so there&#39;s on multiple levels I</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.680" end="00:39:17.809" style="s2">think is an important exercise to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.779" end="00:39:21.319" style="s2">an accurate understanding of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.809" end="00:39:23.930" style="s2">else&#39;s map of reality yeah 100% all</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.319" end="00:39:26.900" style="s2">right so here&#39;s a couple of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.930" end="00:39:30.410" style="s2">things we might do I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.900" end="00:39:33.980" style="s2">down each of the six crises that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.410" end="00:39:37.849" style="s2">recognized in the article so we could</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.980" end="00:39:39.140" style="s2">talk about those but you know perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.849" end="00:39:40.700" style="s2">and you know what perhaps actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.140" end="00:39:43.130" style="s2">perhaps actually we&#39;ll come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.700" end="00:39:45.760" style="s2">because I want to because you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.130" end="00:39:48.020" style="s2">the blue pill and the red pill before</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.760" end="00:39:52.190" style="s2">which of course comes from the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.020" end="00:39:54.440" style="s2">and is has definitely entered popular</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.190" end="00:39:56.630" style="s2">culture and I&#39;m in a major way right and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.440" end="00:39:59.569" style="s2">it&#39;s like the red pill has being the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.630" end="00:40:01.950" style="s2">thing that wakes you up from the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.569" end="00:40:05.010" style="s2">or the status quo that was</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.950" end="00:40:07.859" style="s2">you know in us this state of illusion so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.010" end="00:40:10.470" style="s2">the red pill is this this the shot of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.859" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">disillusionment but the thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.470" end="00:40:13.760" style="s2">the red pill is that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.309" end="00:40:20.940" style="s2">necessary to cool or something you might</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.329" end="00:40:22.380" style="s2">recognize that hey the emperor has no</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.940" end="00:40:23.910" style="s2">clothes like there&#39;s something real</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.380" end="00:40:25.559" style="s2">strange about what&#39;s going on here and</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.910" end="00:40:28.440" style="s2">actually I feel more in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.559" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">what&#39;s really real given I understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.440" end="00:40:35.450" style="s2">this world from this new perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:38.490" style="s2">what happens then right because you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.450" end="00:40:40.859" style="s2">what matrix have you just woken up into</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.490" end="00:40:42.839" style="s2">that you think is real because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.859" end="00:40:44.490" style="s2">differentiated from your previous matrix</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.839" end="00:40:48.299" style="s2">but strings are always being pulled by</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.490" end="00:40:52.829" style="s2">something it seems to me and and enter</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.299" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">here what if I&#39;m right might be if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.829" end="00:40:59.309" style="s2">want to continue with this metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">pill taking we have the gray pill right</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.309" end="00:41:05.549" style="s2">so maybe you could describe to me what</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.650" end="00:41:07.339" style="s2">the gray pill is right this this pill</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.549" end="00:41:10.589" style="s2">territory is you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.339" end="00:41:12.299" style="s2">confusing confusing ground because some</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.589" end="00:41:13.890" style="s2">groups co-opted some groups understand</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.299" end="00:41:16.710" style="s2">it differently yeah you&#39;re right it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.890" end="00:41:19.049" style="s2">started it started with the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.710" end="00:41:20.790" style="s2">the blue pill is sort of like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.049" end="00:41:23.130" style="s2">maintain the reality that you currently</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.790" end="00:41:27.660" style="s2">understand and then the the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.130" end="00:41:31.470" style="s2">you&#39;re shot into the truth and then you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.660" end="00:41:33.660" style="s2">know the the what I said there the red</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.470" end="00:41:35.579" style="s2">pill the the right the reactionary right</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.660" end="00:41:38.309" style="s2">they kind of really co-opted this meme</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.579" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">of the red pill and I think it started</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.309" end="00:41:42.630" style="s2">with the manosphere or the the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:45.390" style="s2">rights activists and then it kind of got</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.630" end="00:41:48.240" style="s2">enlarged to the alt light I&#39;ll write and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.390" end="00:41:50.130" style="s2">then neo reactionaries but this thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.240" end="00:41:52.339" style="s2">that the crux of it like the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.130" end="00:41:55.049" style="s2">being awoken to the truth you can say</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.339" end="00:41:56.790" style="s2">the woke tribes have that&#39;s that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.049" end="00:42:00.030" style="s2">version of the red pill being woke to</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.790" end="00:42:01.829" style="s2">the systemic discrimination of society</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.030" end="00:42:04.680" style="s2">that&#39;s being red pill yeah right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.829" end="00:42:06.059" style="s2">and then in addition to this those the</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.680" end="00:42:07.170" style="s2">dissident right they&#39;re reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.059" end="00:42:08.609" style="s2">right they really seem to run with this</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.170" end="00:42:10.130" style="s2">pill metaphor so there&#39;s like the blue</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.609" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">pill there&#39;s the red pill there</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.130" end="00:42:13.729" style="s2">black pill and he&#39;s just so nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:15.859" style="s2">and now there&#39;s just something called</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.729" end="00:42:17.450" style="s2">the hunk pill like a hunk pill good</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.859" end="00:42:20.690" style="s2">which I we can maybe that&#39;s a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.450" end="00:42:21.979" style="s2">hole we can get down into but then when</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.690" end="00:42:23.420" style="s2">we wouldn&#39;t I mentioned they&#39;re great</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.979" end="00:42:26.269" style="s2">pill in the article is actually the near</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.420" end="00:42:29.769" style="s2">post rationalist tribe Venkatesh Rao</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.269" end="00:42:31.999" style="s2">from Ribbon Farm he coined that term and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.769" end="00:42:33.619" style="s2">he basically said that you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.999" end="00:42:34.849" style="s2">born into the blue pill we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.619" end="00:42:36.680" style="s2">actually take a blue pill we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.849" end="00:42:38.390" style="s2">born into everyday reality sure and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.680" end="00:42:40.249" style="s2">there&#39;s a multitude of different red</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.390" end="00:42:43.640" style="s2">pills that we take that cannot make us</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.249" end="00:42:45.049" style="s2">see the truth but then the gray pill</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.640" end="00:42:46.609" style="s2">sort of muddies the waters a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.049" end="00:42:48.410" style="s2">it adds uncertainty to the mix it adds</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.609" end="00:42:49.910" style="s2">nuance right and then that could lead to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.410" end="00:42:50.779" style="s2">an existential crisis it can lead to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.910" end="00:42:54.049" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.779" end="00:42:56.150" style="s2">but he argues and I tend to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.049" end="00:42:58.309" style="s2">it in order to fully feel intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.150" end="00:43:03.349" style="s2">alive is to start being comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.309" end="00:43:04.369" style="s2">being gray pills right yes yes yes no</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.349" end="00:43:07.309" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.369" end="00:43:11.140" style="s2">so really the great pill as well I just</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.309" end="00:43:13.729" style="s2">hear there is the quite the quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.140" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">obvious if I can use that word quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.729" end="00:43:20.509" style="s2">obvious point that sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:24.619" style="s2">continues you know and you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.509" end="00:43:28.450" style="s2">think many people will be very cognizant</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.619" end="00:43:31.700" style="s2">of the nuance and uncertainty that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.450" end="00:43:35.329" style="s2">very much a part of of our of our makeup</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.700" end="00:43:38.180" style="s2">and the reality we confront so yes I do</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.329" end="00:43:41.029" style="s2">think it&#39;s appropriate for for that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.180" end="00:43:45.109" style="s2">nuance that nuance to be in there good</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.029" end="00:43:49.130" style="s2">good alright okay so let&#39;s see we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.109" end="00:43:51.289" style="s2">these six these six crises which are</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.130" end="00:43:52.880" style="s2">still going to get to because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.289" end="00:43:55.369" style="s2">interested in asking that this is some</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.880" end="00:43:57.140" style="s2">of your recent tweets there&#39;s two terms</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.369" end="00:43:58.069" style="s2">that came up I want you to explain to me</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.140" end="00:44:00.859" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if they relate to each</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.069" end="00:44:03.140" style="s2">other so I apologize if I&#39;m chucking you</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.859" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">tangents here which I suppose I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.140" end="00:44:08.900" style="s2">doing anyway one is image sacrifice and</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:11.619" style="s2">the other is cancel culture well what do</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.900" end="00:44:11.619" style="s2">you mean by these things</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.700" end="00:44:16.539" style="s2">okay this is this is my go down a rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.710" end="00:44:17.859" style="s2">hole is that my edge of my think show</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.539" end="00:44:19.509" style="s2">because when I tweet these things in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.859" end="00:44:22.180" style="s2">this moments of inspiration I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.509" end="00:44:24.479" style="s2">kind of like barfing an idea yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.180" end="00:44:28.599" style="s2">totally speculation and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.479" end="00:44:30.249" style="s2">propositional II attached to it but are</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.599" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">you familiar with the idea of cancel</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.249" end="00:44:37.150" style="s2">culture I read into a little bit after I</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:38.859" style="s2">saw your tweet but no I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.150" end="00:44:40.269" style="s2">formulate it for you but it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.859" end="00:44:43.979" style="s2">in there if you give me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.269" end="00:44:47.229" style="s2">I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be with it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.979" end="00:44:49.900" style="s2">amongst the work tribes in mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.229" end="00:44:51.940" style="s2">media is quite popular to use this</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.900" end="00:44:54.249" style="s2">person has been cancelled yes if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.940" end="00:44:58.239" style="s2">said something controversial if they</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.249" end="00:45:00.519" style="s2">said something racist sexist and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.239" end="00:45:02.140" style="s2">they&#39;re canceled right if we cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.519" end="00:45:04.869" style="s2">from mainstream society plate Society</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.140" end="00:45:06.910" style="s2">cancelled and then your cancels right</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.869" end="00:45:10.569" style="s2">and then there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.910" end="00:45:13.089" style="s2">pushback not only from like the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.569" end="00:45:14.589" style="s2">sort of tries but also within the woke</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.089" end="00:45:16.479" style="s2">tribes just pushed back on this like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.589" end="00:45:18.670" style="s2">Kanye West even though he got cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.479" end="00:45:19.930" style="s2">by wearing that trump hat he&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.670" end="00:45:21.999" style="s2">he did the tweet we should cancel cancel</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.930" end="00:45:23.349" style="s2">culture I think Katy Perry just did a</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.999" end="00:45:24.940" style="s2">speech that we should be careful who we</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.349" end="00:45:27.609" style="s2">can so we should be kind with</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.940" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">forgiveness yeah because the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.609" end="00:45:31.539" style="s2">cancel culture you know you could just</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:33.309" style="s2">really lose your your reputation</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.539" end="00:45:35.829" style="s2">Rini reputation especially if the</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.309" end="00:45:37.989" style="s2">accusation is not on verse and true and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.829" end="00:45:40.630" style="s2">you could also lose your livelihood with</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.989" end="00:45:41.559" style="s2">that reputation right and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.630" end="00:45:42.849" style="s2">people feel like they&#39;re walking on</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.559" end="00:45:44.670" style="s2">eggshells there Terrell that the moments</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.849" end="00:45:50.589" style="s2">notice that could be canceled yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.670" end="00:45:52.329" style="s2">and so and so from that idea I this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.589" end="00:45:55.089" style="s2">my me at the edge of my thinking and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.329" end="00:45:59.319" style="s2">crazy speculative thought is that cancel</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.089" end="00:46:01.869" style="s2">culture kind of got detached from its</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.319" end="00:46:04.269" style="s2">original purpose of maintaining purity</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.869" end="00:46:07.599" style="s2">within the woke tribe and then they just</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.269" end="00:46:09.819" style="s2">want to it&#39;s like a cancel God I like</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.599" end="00:46:13.719" style="s2">the idea the cancel God got emerged and</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.819" end="00:46:16.420" style="s2">the cancel God needs images to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.719" end="00:46:18.430" style="s2">to be sacrificed to mmmm and then these</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.420" end="00:46:20.160" style="s2">these sort of the red pill tribes are</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.430" end="00:46:22.450" style="s2">playing with this like okay what can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.160" end="00:46:23.589" style="s2">sacrifice what images can we sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.450" end="00:46:25.370" style="s2">to the cancel God now</p>

<p begin="00:46:44.630" end="00:46:48.620" style="s2">was sort of the idea I was speculating</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.730" end="00:46:51.050" style="s2">with and so instead of human sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.620" end="00:46:53.720" style="s2">maybe the a need for image sacrifices</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.920" end="00:49:57.730" style="s2">wanting to be that pure it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.510" end="00:50:00.069" style="s2">dangerous on the on the purity grounds</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.730" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">right when people start like I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.069" end="00:50:07.740" style="s2">is spoken about the like a big player in</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.220" end="00:50:16.089" style="s2">conscientiousness there&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.710" end="00:50:19.780" style="s2">think Jordan Peterson makes his point</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.089" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">when he talks about you know he read</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.780" end="00:50:26.170" style="s2">mine mine Kampf Hitler&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:30.300" style="s2">studied the Nazis and made know of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.170" end="00:50:33.670" style="s2">frequent usage of this Hitler is</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.300" end="00:50:35.650" style="s2">mentioning how he wanted the Germans to</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.670" end="00:50:38.380" style="s2">be a pure body and his references were</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.650" end="00:50:41.170" style="s2">always to this theme of purity and what</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.380" end="00:50:43.030" style="s2">violator that like and what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.170" end="00:50:44.680" style="s2">with something that&#39;s that&#39;s impure what</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.030" end="00:50:46.690" style="s2">do you do with vermin with you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.680" end="00:50:49.150" style="s2">they&#39;re in your house you exterminate</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.690" end="00:50:50.130" style="s2">them so it&#39;s and you can see how the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.150" end="00:50:52.769" style="s2">canceling</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.130" end="00:50:55.049" style="s2">and the extermination I mean canceling</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.769" end="00:50:58.440" style="s2">is very much like it&#39;s like the reality</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.049" end="00:51:00.930" style="s2">TV version it&#39;s like somebody&#39;s tied</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.440" end="00:51:02.940" style="s2">into this let&#39;s cancel them you know but</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.930" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">ya know I&#39;m with you I think that&#39;s cool</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.940" end="00:51:06.420" style="s2">I think I think that they&#39;re two times</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.069" style="s2">that image sacrificing cancel culture I</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.420" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">think I think they&#39;re they&#39;re worthy</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.069" end="00:51:13.410" style="s2">additions to this to this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:15.089" style="s2">and this like just the really putting</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.410" end="00:51:17.730" style="s2">myself at am I thinking right now and</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.089" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">might enter some poetic territory but</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.730" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">let&#39;s just say if this cancel culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:23.579" style="s2">kind of gets detached from its original</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.440" style="s2">purpose of sort of policing you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.579" end="00:51:27.450" style="s2">purity of the woke tribes and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.440" end="00:51:28.829" style="s2">sort of like this hungry for should just</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.450" end="00:51:30.359" style="s2">cancel for its own sake</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.829" end="00:51:33.329" style="s2">right the camp I bought emerges right</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.359" end="00:51:35.759" style="s2">and this culture war this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.329" end="00:51:38.700" style="s2">like confused soup that we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.759" end="00:51:41.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really damaging our collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.700" end="00:51:43.529" style="s2">sense making right and I like to view it</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.160" end="00:51:45.089" style="s2">as an existential crisis that prevents</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.529" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">us from addressing other existential</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.089" end="00:51:51.690" style="s2">crisis right and so while this cancel</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:53.519" style="s2">God is canceling everything right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.690" end="00:51:55.440" style="s2">just kind of setting up us to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.519" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">cancelled as a human race right if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.440" end="00:51:59.700" style="s2">don&#39;t address these existential threats</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.950" style="s2">yeah so I&#39;m trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.700" end="00:52:04.109" style="s2">like maybe more linked up more</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.950" end="00:52:05.880" style="s2">articulately and in an essay format but</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.109" end="00:52:09.210" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of an idea that I&#39;m playing</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.880" end="00:52:10.650" style="s2">with yeah look where the idea I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.210" end="00:52:13.529" style="s2">thing I would point to of course is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.650" end="00:52:15.359" style="s2">there&#39;s many tendencies within us many</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.529" end="00:52:18.180" style="s2">tendencies even staying within this</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.359" end="00:52:20.279" style="s2">field of memetic identification into</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.180" end="00:52:21.809" style="s2">these different tribes there are many</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.279" end="00:52:24.029" style="s2">versions of those I think that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.809" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">setting us up to be cancelled right I</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.029" end="00:52:28.559" style="s2">think if you take only the black pill</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:30.869" style="s2">and fall into a some sort of nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.559" end="00:52:32.279" style="s2">spin then this is a problem and look</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.869" end="00:52:33.900" style="s2">there&#39;s many nihilists out there to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.279" end="00:52:35.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand nihilism Nilan</p>

<p begin="00:52:35.430" end="00:52:38.759" style="s2">emancipatory because then once you</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.349" end="00:52:40.380" style="s2">understand that there&#39;s no objective</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.759" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">meaning you know then you can just</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.380" end="00:52:44.309" style="s2">create your own meaning and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:45.569" style="s2">okay well there&#39;s a big conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.309" end="00:52:49.109" style="s2">get into there I would say that most</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.569" end="00:52:52.230" style="s2">people who embody nihilism do not engage</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.109" end="00:52:58.529" style="s2">actively in a certain kind of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.230" end="00:53:00.869" style="s2">making that is adaptive well over any</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.529" end="00:53:02.420" style="s2">period of time apart from the immediate</p>

<p begin="00:53:02.420" end="00:53:05.960" style="s2">vacation one but that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.160" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">conversation and we don&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.960" end="00:53:10.069" style="s2">into that here I have big interest in</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:11.480" style="s2">nihilism and in meaning and what have</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.069" end="00:53:13.430" style="s2">you just spoke to John in Vevey icky</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.480" end="00:53:14.839" style="s2">yesterday which had a really listened</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.430" end="00:53:16.880" style="s2">conversation there I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.839" end="00:53:18.589" style="s2">John&#39;s appearance on your podcast so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.880" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">recommend everybody go listen to that on</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.589" end="00:53:22.819" style="s2">the intellectual Explorers Club so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:23.660" style="s2">hope to talk to John many more times I</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.819" end="00:53:26.240" style="s2">think that was a really good</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.660" end="00:53:28.369" style="s2">conversation and I think coming to</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.240" end="00:53:33.530" style="s2">understand the meaning crisis and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.369" end="00:53:36.829" style="s2">meaning is at a level that is requires</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.530" end="00:53:38.980" style="s2">levels of analysis far beyond the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.829" end="00:53:41.210" style="s2">cultural you know understanding</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.980" end="00:53:45.230" style="s2">historical development of our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.210" end="00:53:47.240" style="s2">and the metaphysical basis for reality</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.230" end="00:53:49.790" style="s2">as such I think that&#39;s also involved as</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.240" end="00:53:52.040" style="s2">well you have the physiological level</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.790" end="00:53:55.069" style="s2">what it is to be in states of flow and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.040" end="00:53:56.809" style="s2">and and you want to talk about religion</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.069" end="00:53:59.410" style="s2">and nutrition and all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.809" end="00:54:02.390" style="s2">things all of that folds into</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.410" end="00:54:04.809" style="s2">understanding their felt phenomenon of</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.390" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">being in meaningful relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.809" end="00:54:12.650" style="s2">but so okay so maybe that brings us to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:15.470" style="s2">these two these crises then and there</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.650" end="00:54:17.599" style="s2">are six we have the secularization and</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.470" end="00:54:20.839" style="s2">the meaning crisis we have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.599" end="00:54:23.030" style="s2">fragmentation and the reality crisis we</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.839" end="00:54:25.940" style="s2">have the atomization and the belonging</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.030" end="00:54:28.730" style="s2">crisis we have the globalization and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.940" end="00:54:32.059" style="s2">proximity crisis we have the stimulation</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.730" end="00:54:36.260" style="s2">and sobriety crisis and we have the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.059" end="00:54:39.670" style="s2">weaponization and the warfare crisis now</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.260" end="00:54:44.900" style="s2">you also do this really nice one-line</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.670" end="00:54:46.819" style="s2">descriptions of each of these crises so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.900" end="00:54:48.680" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s worth me just reading those</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.819" end="00:54:50.359" style="s2">out to if that&#39;s alright with you and</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.680" end="00:54:51.950" style="s2">then and then you know you can decide</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.359" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">what one you&#39;d like to comment on mainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.950" end="00:54:54.440" style="s2">because we won&#39;t have time to get to</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:54:57.530" style="s2">them all and they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.440" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">interesting all of them so the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.530" end="00:55:01.250" style="s2">crisis weakened our collective</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:04.460" style="s2">understanding of what ought to be and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.250" end="00:55:05.750" style="s2">these are all quotes the reality crisis</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.460" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">fractured our collective understanding</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.750" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">of what is the belonging crisis took</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:14.450" style="s2">away a genuine feeling of community the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:16.099" style="s2">proximity crisis removed distance from</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.450" end="00:55:18.410" style="s2">conflicting views</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.099" end="00:55:21.109" style="s2">the sobriety crisis reduced our agency</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.410" end="00:55:22.849" style="s2">and turned us into addicts the warfare</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.109" end="00:55:25.690" style="s2">crisis transformed our minds into</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.849" end="00:55:28.309" style="s2">weapons for hidden Wars in plain sight</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.690" end="00:55:30.019" style="s2">they&#39;re really ties depressing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.309" end="00:55:31.549" style="s2">really really tight they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.019" end="00:55:34.009" style="s2">really tight sentences there man and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.549" end="00:55:36.109" style="s2">having read the having read the article</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.009" end="00:55:38.539" style="s2">a couple times it&#39;s um it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.109" end="00:55:39.949" style="s2">nicely it&#39;s really nicely analytically</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.539" end="00:55:42.380" style="s2">derived from that from that other</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.949" end="00:55:45.109" style="s2">writing so I really appreciate it thank</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.380" end="00:55:47.509" style="s2">you thank you yeah just when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.109" end="00:55:51.769" style="s2">reading that out of like mr. pressing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.509" end="00:55:53.890" style="s2">Keys together and come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.769" end="00:55:56.660" style="s2">other crises as well right as well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.890" end="00:55:58.959" style="s2">this is a good city to start with this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.660" end="00:56:02.239" style="s2">is some issues we have going on here</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.959" end="00:56:04.579" style="s2">yeah I don&#39;t know how much I have to add</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.239" end="00:56:06.140" style="s2">to that kind of that summary but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.579" end="00:56:08.509" style="s2">sort of like the the first to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.140" end="00:56:10.609" style="s2">meaning crisis and the reality crisis</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.509" end="00:56:12.289" style="s2">and I guess maybe the reality crisis</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.609" end="00:56:16.309" style="s2">could have been dubbed the sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.289" end="00:56:19.400" style="s2">crisis or the truth crisis sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.309" end="00:56:22.549" style="s2">you know how each map of reality has</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.400" end="00:56:24.680" style="s2">sort of an is in a nod yes right what a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.549" end="00:56:26.839" style="s2">descriptive a description of what</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.680" end="00:56:31.069" style="s2">reality is and then what reality ought</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.839" end="00:56:32.959" style="s2">to be and collectively you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.069" end="00:56:35.930" style="s2">argument was like when say the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.959" end="00:56:38.269" style="s2">Christian mean Plex dominated a certain</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.930" end="00:56:39.949" style="s2">portion of our planet you know there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.269" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">a shared is a not a shared map of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.949" end="00:56:46.839" style="s2">reality but now there&#39;s not rights right</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s no kind of a agreed-upon</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.839" end="00:56:52.249" style="s2">epistemic way to figure out what is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:53.869" style="s2">truthful or sort of a formula moral</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.249" end="00:56:56.509" style="s2">formula in order to figure out what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.869" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">should do and that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.509" end="00:57:00.469" style="s2">problematic if we want to get along</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:03.380" style="s2">together okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.469" end="00:57:04.489" style="s2">yeah I may have initiative levels yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.380" end="00:57:06.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you have any prompt</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.489" end="00:57:07.670" style="s2">question prompts because I can go down</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.199" end="00:57:09.170" style="s2">many different different threads with</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.670" end="00:57:11.959" style="s2">these these crises question prompts</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.170" end="00:57:15.469" style="s2">generally I&#39;ll just wind myself into</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.959" end="00:57:18.799" style="s2">some sort of imaginary projected gear</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.469" end="00:57:20.809" style="s2">don&#39;t worry though yeah but I see what</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.799" end="00:57:22.869" style="s2">what comes up for me and these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.809" end="00:57:22.869" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:31.249" style="s2">well these are all interrelated to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.299" end="00:57:38.690" style="s2">degree right let me see what any CI can</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.249" end="00:57:40.339" style="s2">do with this so we have a we have this</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.690" end="00:57:43.460" style="s2">meaning crisis we have in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.339" end="00:57:47.450" style="s2">this part of us that requires feeling</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.460" end="00:57:52.249" style="s2">effectively involved or engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.450" end="00:57:54.469" style="s2">process of becoming of growth that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.249" end="00:57:57.049" style="s2">know I&#39;m putting in a lot of my own you</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.469" end="00:57:58.430" style="s2">know assumptions and premises here into</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.049" end="00:58:00.259" style="s2">what I think meaning is but if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.430" end="00:58:01.940" style="s2">allow me that meaning to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.259" end="00:58:04.900" style="s2">meaningful relationship with is to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.940" end="00:58:08.119" style="s2">something like a growth relationship</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.900" end="00:58:09.430" style="s2">towards transformation you know and</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.119" end="00:58:12.079" style="s2">Jordan Peterson would say something like</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.430" end="00:58:13.960" style="s2">meaning is roughly proportional to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.079" end="00:58:17.509" style="s2">responsibility you take up but I would</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.960" end="00:58:18.829" style="s2">but that responsibility as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.509" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">is something that&#39;s embedded in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.829" end="00:58:24.650" style="s2">collective and so your responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:27.229" style="s2">becomes responsibility for the creation</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.650" end="00:58:29.239" style="s2">of habitable order which can only be</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.229" end="00:58:31.700" style="s2">understood in terms of this mesh</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.239" end="00:58:32.900" style="s2">collective net these are all things</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.700" end="00:58:34.489" style="s2">he&#39;ll agree with it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.900" end="00:58:36.529" style="s2">individuals have agency within this</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.489" end="00:58:38.989" style="s2">space so we take meaning as something</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.529" end="00:58:40.910" style="s2">like a relationship of transfer you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.989" end="00:58:42.890" style="s2">transformation and growth within self</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.910" end="00:58:44.180" style="s2">that&#39;s in touch with reality we could</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.890" end="00:58:50.410" style="s2">say many more things about it but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.180" end="00:58:55.219" style="s2">go with that we have the challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.410" end="00:58:57.079" style="s2">relating this meaning-making effectively</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.219" end="00:58:59.390" style="s2">engaged part of us with what we can</p>

<p begin="01:06:08.910" end="01:06:13.560" style="s2">love is wrapped around in many cases</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.609" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">resentment for the conditions of being</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.560" end="01:06:16.110" style="s2">and it&#39;s a bit of a challenge whoever</p>

<p begin="01:06:16.110" end="01:06:20.370" style="s2">metaphysical level there&#39;s there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.120" end="01:06:22.370" style="s2">oppositional tension and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.370" end="01:06:26.610" style="s2">not all I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s all roses</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.370" end="01:06:29.820" style="s2">but the reality is is that you can walk</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.610" end="01:06:32.160" style="s2">around and like just yesterday you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.820" end="01:06:35.580" style="s2">everyday try and find these moments for</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.160" end="01:06:37.170" style="s2">gratitude and and and unfortunate to</p>

<p begin="01:06:45.840" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">all cases really in fact look even with</p>

<p begin="01:07:01.350" end="01:07:05.160" style="s2">is right for me to engage in some sort</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.880" end="01:07:06.930" style="s2">of interaction there may be there in</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.160" end="01:07:08.520" style="s2">some physical altercation with someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.930" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">and you can just kind of separate it a</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.520" end="01:07:14.070" style="s2">bit or maybe just you catch you catch a</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:17.430" style="s2">little fragment of the ramblings of</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.070" end="01:07:19.860" style="s2">someone and it&#39;s like a little opening</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.430" end="01:07:21.300" style="s2">for you to participate in it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.860" end="01:07:23.910" style="s2">connection can be found all over the</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.300" end="01:07:26.900" style="s2">place and everyone everyone&#39;s just</p>

<p begin="01:07:39.810" end="01:07:44.180" style="s2">it really is there and and and we can</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:48.060" style="s2">get lost so much in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.180" end="01:07:50.130" style="s2">intellectualization of the conflicts we</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.060" end="01:07:52.200" style="s2">find ourselves in and look it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.130" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">that isn&#39;t valid and necessary you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.200" end="01:08:00.230" style="s2">I really believe it is necessary to come</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:08:03.750" style="s2">to ever more keenly defined analytic</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.230" end="01:08:06.150" style="s2">formulations of where we&#39;re at as a</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.750" end="01:08:09.320" style="s2">culture and as individuals but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.150" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">something about the non intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.320" end="01:08:18.060" style="s2">embodiment of shared humanity in the</p>

<p begin="01:08:25.740" end="01:08:31.860" style="s2">meaning to continue so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.090" end="01:08:35.160" style="s2">something worth stressing and it brings</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.860" end="01:08:37.830" style="s2">us to a further place in conversation as</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.160" end="01:08:38.600" style="s2">we have pretty about 10-15 minutes to go</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.830" end="01:08:40.980" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.600" end="01:08:44.520" style="s2">which is something else I also admire a</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.980" end="01:08:48.390" style="s2">lot about what you&#39;re doing certainly</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.520" end="01:08:50.820" style="s2">take inspiration from well you know I</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.390" end="01:08:54.360" style="s2">mean to be fair it&#39;s something I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.820" end="01:08:56.610" style="s2">been pursuing and I look at you as</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.360" end="01:08:58.080" style="s2">someone who&#39;s also pursuing this and has</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.610" end="01:09:01.310" style="s2">brought things to a different point of</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.080" end="01:09:04.820" style="s2">articulation which I really like and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.310" end="01:09:07.230" style="s2">turn one of the responses to this broad</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.820" end="01:09:12.110" style="s2">Gestalt we&#39;ve now put forward over the</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.230" end="01:09:15.210" style="s2">last hour this this culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.110" end="01:09:16.950" style="s2">constituted by these various crises one</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.210" end="01:09:18.390" style="s2">response as and we&#39;ve sort of already</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.950" end="01:09:20.040" style="s2">what I&#39;ve already spoken about there is</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.390" end="01:09:22.590" style="s2">a little bit as about philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.040" end="01:09:24.540" style="s2">way of being and not just discourse it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.590" end="01:09:26.310" style="s2">tapping into this actual embodiment of</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.540" end="01:09:27.870" style="s2">some of this stuff but one term you use</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.310" end="01:09:29.580" style="s2">is and we&#39;ve spoken about great peeling</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.870" end="01:09:31.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve spoken about mimetic mediators</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.580" end="01:09:32.970" style="s2">we&#39;ve spoken about collective</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.950" end="01:09:34.920" style="s2">consciousness and collective</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.970" end="01:09:37.470" style="s2">intelligence a little bit but here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.920" end="01:09:39.300" style="s2">term it&#39;s the Hippocratic oath which you</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.470" end="01:09:41.880" style="s2">define as values of commitment to</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.300" end="01:09:44.720" style="s2">good-faith discourse analogous to</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.880" end="01:09:47.400" style="s2">something like the Geneva Convention and</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.720" end="01:09:49.620" style="s2">you do this you do this thing on your</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.400" end="01:09:53.250" style="s2">intellectual Explorers Club podcast you</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.620" end="01:09:55.140" style="s2">have a spoken affirmation that you take</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.250" end="01:09:57.750" style="s2">into the conversation and as I</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.140" end="01:10:00.240" style="s2">understand it it&#39;s your attempt to yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.750" end="01:10:03.150" style="s2">set the container right for coming into</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.240" end="01:10:05.340" style="s2">this right relationship of discourse so</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.150" end="01:10:06.450" style="s2">I wonder if if you can talk up a little</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.340" end="01:10:08.460" style="s2">bit about what you mean by the</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.450" end="01:10:12.240" style="s2">Hippocratic oath yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.460" end="01:10:15.480" style="s2">mmm you know this is timely that you ask</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.240" end="01:10:17.460" style="s2">this question I&#39;m gonna answer that I do</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.480" end="01:10:21.540" style="s2">want to comment on a few things that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.460" end="01:10:22.740" style="s2">mentioned that came up so I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.540" end="01:10:25.380" style="s2">they&#39;re relevant and I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.740" end="01:10:28.920" style="s2">lose them so just to kind of close that</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.380" end="01:10:31.350" style="s2">that thread on the outrage you know I</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.920" end="01:10:33.150" style="s2">think outrage is a good thing and like</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.350" end="01:10:35.130" style="s2">Aristotle talks about outrage is like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.150" end="01:10:35.880" style="s2">healthy noon right and so some would</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.130" end="01:10:38.880" style="s2">attacks</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.880" end="01:10:40.140" style="s2">my family I&#39;m gonna get outraged and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.880" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">going to defend you and I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.140" end="01:10:42.480" style="s2">fight that person where I want to stop</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:44.070" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.480" end="01:10:45.630" style="s2">so when we see great evils in the world</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.070" end="01:10:47.700" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna get outraged rightfully so</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.630" end="01:10:50.160" style="s2">and we want to and it hopefully will</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.700" end="01:10:52.260" style="s2">motivated us to action but I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.160" end="01:10:54.240" style="s2">outrage porn makes us impotent right and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.260" end="01:10:56.580" style="s2">mixes doesn&#39;t make us lead to action</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.240" end="01:10:58.050" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re healthy outraged makes us</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.580" end="01:11:00.540" style="s2">one hack and toxic out raise your</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.050" end="01:11:02.580" style="s2">overage porn prevents action right just</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.540" end="01:11:06.000" style="s2">like how real porn prevents sex from</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.580" end="01:11:08.010" style="s2">occurring right it&#39;s a stimulated sex</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.000" end="01:11:09.660" style="s2">and stimulated outrage and so I do think</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.010" end="01:11:12.740" style="s2">outrage is good but then this current</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.660" end="01:11:15.540" style="s2">sort of use of outrage is not healthy</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.740" end="01:11:17.160" style="s2">the other thing that that you said what</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.540" end="01:11:20.430" style="s2">I liked is that the kind of this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.160" end="01:11:23.130" style="s2">transient there transcendent kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.430" end="01:11:25.050" style="s2">component of the humanist there that</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.130" end="01:11:27.150" style="s2">that gets lost and we can get lost in</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.050" end="01:11:31.230" style="s2">this kind of a cup of cognitive realm</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.150" end="01:11:33.630" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s engaging in spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.230" end="01:11:36.510" style="s2">practices is is very important very</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.630" end="01:11:39.660" style="s2">critical and sort of my crude or my</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.510" end="01:11:42.830" style="s2">problem I placeholder understanding of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.660" end="01:11:45.960" style="s2">spirituality is overcoming the state of</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.830" end="01:11:48.990" style="s2">disconnectedness right and is becoming</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.960" end="01:11:50.190" style="s2">connected to the home and I actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.990" end="01:11:51.750" style="s2">just want to start talking with it I</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.190" end="01:11:53.550" style="s2">feel I don&#39;t I just got a wave of</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.750" end="01:11:56.030" style="s2">connectedness overcoming which was</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.550" end="01:11:59.160" style="s2">interesting but when I find when I</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.030" end="01:12:01.530" style="s2">engage regularly in a spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.160" end="01:12:02.370" style="s2">my desire to love is greater than my</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.530" end="01:12:07.800" style="s2">desire to be loved</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.370" end="01:12:09.330" style="s2">hmm right and I think you can you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.800" end="01:12:11.160" style="s2">approach this like I&#39;m sort of a have</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.330" end="01:12:12.060" style="s2">perennial tendencies I think you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.160" end="01:12:15.030" style="s2">approach this from various different</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.060" end="01:12:18.300" style="s2">traditions and in experience that state</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.030" end="01:12:21.750" style="s2">and I also would say that&#39;s having the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.300" end="01:12:23.400" style="s2">capacity when I&#39;m being meta when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.750" end="01:12:25.170" style="s2">playing the meta game and then just and</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.400" end="01:12:26.610" style="s2">my understanding the meta game is just</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.170" end="01:12:28.050" style="s2">taking yourself out of your own finite</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.610" end="01:12:31.050" style="s2">game and then looking at all the finite</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.050" end="01:12:32.910" style="s2">games non-judgmentally that when I can</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.050" end="01:12:35.580" style="s2">get into that liminal state more often</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.910" end="01:12:36.840" style="s2">my desire to be outraged or engage an</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.580" end="01:12:38.970" style="s2">outraged porn becomes less and less</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.840" end="01:12:40.800" style="s2">right so I do think maybe even being</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.970" end="01:12:45.660" style="s2">meta in that sense is a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.800" end="01:12:47.700" style="s2">practice in it yes yes yes and then you</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.660" end="01:12:49.170" style="s2">know comment on the Hippocratic oath of</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.700" end="01:12:50.190" style="s2">the the culture war</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.170" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">and then know that you know that if you</p>

<p begin="01:13:12.360" end="01:13:16.980" style="s2">the kind of ten aspects of it and so for</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.600" end="01:13:19.470" style="s2">the listeners who are not familiar the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.980" end="01:13:20.760" style="s2">Hippocratic oath is an oath that people</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.470" end="01:13:24.540" style="s2">who engage in medicine used to take</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.760" end="01:13:26.790" style="s2">right and it&#39;s sort of like a statement</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.540" end="01:13:28.800" style="s2">that they read out loud in order to</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.790" end="01:13:31.230" style="s2">ground themselves and the principle how</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.800" end="01:13:33.000" style="s2">to be a good practitioner of medicine to</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.230" end="01:13:35.670" style="s2">be a good doctor and people who finished</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.000" end="01:13:38.190" style="s2">medical school still still do it in sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.670" end="01:13:40.020" style="s2">of a traditional sense doesn&#39;t hold any</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.190" end="01:13:41.660" style="s2">sort of weight as it once did but they</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.020" end="01:13:44.340" style="s2">still still say it as sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.660" end="01:13:47.070" style="s2">traditional oath and then the argument</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.340" end="01:13:49.770" style="s2">they&#39;re there the flirtatious</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.070" end="01:13:53.820" style="s2">speculation there is that if more</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.770" end="01:13:56.310" style="s2">journalists bloggers anybody who engages</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.820" end="01:13:58.650" style="s2">in and creating mimetic artifacts right</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.310" end="01:14:00.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like they read this oath out loud</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.650" end="01:14:01.740" style="s2">and then maybe they film themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.510" end="01:14:03.540" style="s2">they have it and maybe there could be a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.740" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">badge there or you can put on your blog</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.540" end="01:14:08.130" style="s2">or your Twitter handle or something</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:11.100" style="s2">saying that you&#39;re trying to uphold that</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.130" end="01:14:13.140" style="s2">standard oath and the the rough draft</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.100" end="01:14:14.430" style="s2">that were kind of creating right now is</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.140" end="01:14:17.100" style="s2">sort of like engaging good-faith</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.430" end="01:14:19.980" style="s2">dialogue right have intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.100" end="01:14:22.230" style="s2">humility approach a situation that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.980" end="01:14:23.610" style="s2">know I could be wrong Yeah right had</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.230" end="01:14:26.010" style="s2">that copy out under your whatever your</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.610" end="01:14:27.990" style="s2">statement that I could be wrong stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.010" end="01:14:30.990" style="s2">like that and so that&#39;s sort of the idea</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.990" end="01:14:34.170" style="s2">like I&#39;m not again it&#39;s just a playful</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.990" end="01:14:36.240" style="s2">speculation but I think that might pick</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.170" end="01:14:38.220" style="s2">up some steam if enough people engage in</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.240" end="01:14:40.980" style="s2">it yeah man for sure look that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.220" end="01:14:46.320" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.980" end="01:14:47.700" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t published anything I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.320" end="01:14:49.650" style="s2">definitely written a bunch of things in</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.700" end="01:14:52.260" style="s2">emails to different people and I have my</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.650" end="01:14:55.880" style="s2">own draft writing on this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.260" end="01:15:00.540" style="s2">just what are the values that I am</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.880" end="01:15:03.159" style="s2">basing well that must be infused in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.540" end="01:15:06.520" style="s2">community and the project</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.159" end="01:15:10.719" style="s2">and how I am embody this whole process</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.520" end="01:15:12.190" style="s2">and intellectual humility is one of them</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.719" end="01:15:15.429" style="s2">there&#39;s absolutely no doubt I think I</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.190" end="01:15:18.760" style="s2">mentioned one before this some belief in</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.429" end="01:15:21.280" style="s2">the dignity of the human spirit and the</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.760" end="01:15:23.620" style="s2">other one is commitment to authentic</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.280" end="01:15:28.420" style="s2">truth seeking and it&#39;s something similar</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.620" end="01:15:31.179" style="s2">it&#39;s like what do you take in too not</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.420" end="01:15:33.670" style="s2">just discussion but relating in general</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.179" end="01:15:36.870" style="s2">right what do you take into relating</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.670" end="01:15:40.810" style="s2">with human beings that enables you to</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.870" end="01:15:43.330" style="s2">yeah have I mean people use the terms</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.810" end="01:15:46.659" style="s2">good faith discourse I find good faith</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.330" end="01:15:48.340" style="s2">the good faith discourse me my I get a</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.659" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">little bit of a something a little dry</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.340" end="01:15:51.940" style="s2">about it and I like Sam Harris as a man</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:55.860" style="s2">I think he&#39;s a good dude and I think as</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.940" end="01:16:00.820" style="s2">well he communicates very well and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.860" end="01:16:03.429" style="s2">respect him the good faith dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.820" end="01:16:04.810" style="s2">memes that surround like sam harris and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.429" end="01:16:07.030" style="s2">some other other guys for some reason i</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.810" end="01:16:10.179" style="s2">find good faith dialogue good faith it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.030" end="01:16:12.100" style="s2">a bit dry to me I don&#39;t know why partly</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.179" end="01:16:14.980" style="s2">because of course there&#39;s sam harris he</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.100" end="01:16:16.449" style="s2">died it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.980" end="01:16:18.780" style="s2">contradiction there the man doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.449" end="01:16:22.690" style="s2">really think much of faith catechol a</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.780" end="01:16:25.810" style="s2">brief like this this term I really like</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.690" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">called weaponized meta language right</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.810" end="01:16:33.100" style="s2">it&#39;s booking why we argue or how we are</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:34.210" style="s2">you introduced it and it&#39;s this the idea</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.100" end="01:16:35.830" style="s2">that when you when you create a meta</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.210" end="01:16:37.570" style="s2">language to explain a phenomena more</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.830" end="01:16:38.560" style="s2">like something like good faith dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.570" end="01:16:41.469" style="s2">and even though it could be</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.560" end="01:16:43.630" style="s2">propositional e sound if a certain kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.469" end="01:16:47.230" style="s2">of tribe or a certain person uses it</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.630" end="01:16:49.750" style="s2">right and then it&#39;s it gets dirty right</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.230" end="01:16:51.460" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s like something you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.750" end="01:16:53.949" style="s2">want to use and so that I had the same</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.460" end="01:16:56.560" style="s2">feeling over sort of the that term oh</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.949" end="01:17:00.429" style="s2">yeah good face we might not use it but I</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.560" end="01:17:01.510" style="s2">do think there&#39;s a sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.429" end="01:17:03.750" style="s2">what we talked about earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.510" end="01:17:05.949" style="s2">having the spirit of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.750" end="01:17:07.900" style="s2">sometimes all you need even though if</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.949" end="01:17:11.710" style="s2">you get there map of reality right yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.900" end="01:17:13.810" style="s2">yes look it&#39;s cool man I think about</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.710" end="01:17:16.360" style="s2">this stuff a lot I had a chat a</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.810" end="01:17:16.840" style="s2">preliminary chat with Daniel Thorson of</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.360" end="01:17:18.310" style="s2">the emerge</p>

<p begin="01:17:24.520" end="01:17:28.239" style="s2">we also spoke a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.170" end="01:17:29.710" style="s2">together and I&#39;ll record a podcast with</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.239" end="01:17:31.449" style="s2">Daniel I suppose over the next over the</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.710" end="01:17:34.650" style="s2">coming months and we sort of recognized</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.449" end="01:17:36.760" style="s2">that there are a bunch of us out there</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.650" end="01:17:39.820" style="s2">interested in just this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.760" end="01:17:42.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to and I&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.820" end="01:17:45.699" style="s2">in what and we can talk about this more</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.540" end="01:17:51.190" style="s2">off-air about what ways we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.699" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">collaborate to - yeah like try and try</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.190" end="01:17:54.960" style="s2">and do this as well as possible because</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.070" end="01:18:00.699" style="s2">well it would put into practice a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.320" end="01:18:02.440" style="s2">the things we&#39;re talking about valuing</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.699" end="01:18:05.860" style="s2">in many respects right this whole notion</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.440" end="01:18:07.420" style="s2">of coming into some sort of collective</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.860" end="01:18:12.280" style="s2">space of exploration</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.420" end="01:18:16.570" style="s2">- yeah figure out like interesting ways</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.280" end="01:18:18.460" style="s2">forward in in getting clear on what some</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.570" end="01:18:19.570" style="s2">of these values are so anyway if you</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.460" end="01:18:21.190" style="s2">would like to talk about some of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.570" end="01:18:23.010" style="s2">stuff we can we can chat about it</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.190" end="01:18:27.099" style="s2">afterwards because I do think that</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.010" end="01:18:29.230" style="s2">getting getting that right not that it</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.099" end="01:18:32.020" style="s2">would be final but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.230" end="01:18:35.020" style="s2">philosophy that underlies some of these</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.020" end="01:18:38.739" style="s2">commitments right and really there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.020" end="01:18:40.449" style="s2">lot of tile discussion points to be had</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.739" end="01:18:42.520" style="s2">there maybe I&#39;ll say this and this could</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.449" end="01:18:44.310" style="s2">be a call to action to the listeners</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.520" end="01:18:48.460" style="s2">right now cuz I did have a chat with</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.310" end="01:18:51.190" style="s2">Daniel Thorson last weekend and you know</p>

<p begin="01:19:27.400" end="01:19:31.599" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.929" end="01:19:35.400" style="s2">practice right with the call.we spaces</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.599" end="01:19:38.170" style="s2">and having kind of a container where</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.400" end="01:19:40.269" style="s2">dialogue once a good-faith dialogue but</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.170" end="01:19:43.479" style="s2">dialogue can occur with these certain</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.269" end="01:19:47.289" style="s2">values or principles and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.479" end="01:19:50.139" style="s2">out loud is if if this could if we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.289" end="01:19:51.909" style="s2">create something that happens online and</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.139" end="01:19:53.679" style="s2">digital spaces and adjacent that that</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.909" end="01:19:56.559" style="s2">could happen in our respect it seems</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.679" end="01:19:58.539" style="s2">right which could be scalable right so</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.559" end="01:20:00.179" style="s2">other people can engage in this and in</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.539" end="01:20:02.019" style="s2">other cities and the engagin and online</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.179" end="01:20:05.260" style="s2">and I think that would be a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.019" end="01:20:07.959" style="s2">thing because people want to get out of</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.260" end="01:20:11.400" style="s2">this outrage porno it doesn&#39;t lead to</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.959" end="01:20:17.439" style="s2">happy us right it doesn&#39;t lead to ideas</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.400" end="01:20:19.300" style="s2">yeah Yeah right look I mean I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.439" end="01:20:22.119" style="s2">definitely open to pursuing something</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.300" end="01:20:24.749" style="s2">like this I mean because concretely here</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.119" end="01:20:26.920" style="s2">in Melbourne this is something I am</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.749" end="01:20:28.659" style="s2">already doing you know I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.920" end="01:20:30.309" style="s2">people together I&#39;m trying to have these</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.659" end="01:20:33.369" style="s2">conversations whether it&#39;s after a</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.309" end="01:20:35.920" style="s2">lecture that we watch or I think we</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.369" end="01:20:38.979" style="s2">spoke about before or fair a couple</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.920" end="01:20:44.289" style="s2">weeks ago about conversations at dinner</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.979" end="01:20:47.409" style="s2">and different kinds of business models</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.289" end="01:20:51.400" style="s2">for bringing people together for</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.409" end="01:20:55.030" style="s2">meaningful discussion and yes I see I</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.400" end="01:20:57.610" style="s2">see lots of ways or at least I see I see</p>
