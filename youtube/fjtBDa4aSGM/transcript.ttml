<p begin="00:00:11.820" end="00:00:17.260" style="s2">today we&#39;re going to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.440" end="00:00:22.570" style="s2">more about the fractionation of openness</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.260" end="00:00:24.099" style="s2">to experience and we&#39;ve done a fair</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.570" end="00:00:25.900" style="s2">number of studies with the Big Five</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.099" end="00:00:28.419" style="s2">aspect scale which we talked about a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.900" end="00:00:30.790" style="s2">which enables the Big Five model to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.419" end="00:00:35.170" style="s2">differentiated down into two aspects per</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.790" end="00:00:37.420" style="s2">trait and those aspects have been useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.170" end="00:00:39.610" style="s2">for a variety of reasons for example</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.420" end="00:00:41.579" style="s2">when we&#39;re looking at political behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.610" end="00:00:44.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve been able to determine that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.579" end="00:00:46.539" style="s2">conservatives who are generally regarded</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.530" end="00:00:48.820" style="s2">as higher in conscientiousness are</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.539" end="00:00:50.800" style="s2">actually more specifically higher in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.820" end="00:00:53.019" style="s2">orderliness it&#39;s not a lot of difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.800" end="00:00:54.579" style="s2">between liberals and conservatives with</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.019" end="00:00:57.100" style="s2">regards to industriousness and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.579" end="00:00:59.589" style="s2">also been able to determine at least to</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.100" end="00:01:02.100" style="s2">some degree that orderliness seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.589" end="00:01:04.330" style="s2">associated with disgust sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.100" end="00:01:06.190" style="s2">disgust sensitivity as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.330" end="00:01:08.380" style="s2">behavioural immune system and so part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.190" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">the reasons that conservatives are more</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.380" end="00:01:11.860" style="s2">inclined to want things like close</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:13.510" style="s2">borders is because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.860" end="00:01:15.190" style="s2">concerned about maintaining the</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.510" end="00:01:17.890" style="s2">boundaries between things and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.190" end="00:01:20.740" style="s2">for that seems to be fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.890" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">associated with disgust and I&#39;ll talk to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.740" end="00:01:25.270" style="s2">you a lot about that next week because</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">once we&#39;ve sorted that out it really</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.270" end="00:01:29.979" style="s2">really illuminated my way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:32.289" style="s2">about things that had happened for</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.979" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">example in Nazi Germany because people</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.289" end="00:01:37.119" style="s2">tend to people tend to think about like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:39.039" style="s2">when people have been studying</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:40.930" style="s2">conservatism from the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.039" end="00:01:42.789" style="s2">perspective they&#39;ve tended to assume</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.930" end="00:01:44.829" style="s2">that it&#39;s associated with fear of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.789" end="00:01:46.149" style="s2">out-group say and the Conservatives are</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.829" end="00:01:47.789" style="s2">more fearful the Liberals but that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.149" end="00:01:49.780" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.789" end="00:01:51.280" style="s2">conservatives are not hiring trait</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.780" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">neuroticism and that&#39;s a really tough</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:55.030" style="s2">one because if you are going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:57.189" style="s2">case that a group one group is more</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.030" end="00:01:58.659" style="s2">anxious let&#39;s say or threat sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.189" end="00:02:00.340" style="s2">than another and you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.659" end="00:02:10.360" style="s2">differences in treatment autism then</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.340" end="00:02:12.100" style="s2">you&#39;ve really got a problem well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.360" end="00:02:14.260" style="s2">but the theories the theories seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.100" end="00:02:17.230" style="s2">more trade like rather than situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.260" end="00:02:19.210" style="s2">yeah so so but what we have found is</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.230" end="00:02:20.650" style="s2">that that you know for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.210" end="00:02:23.260" style="s2">people thought that all of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.650" end="00:02:24.760" style="s2">emotions loaded on neuroticism and it</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.260" end="00:02:26.409" style="s2">was like the global</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.760" end="00:02:29.200" style="s2">the global trade for negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.409" end="00:02:32.409" style="s2">but disgust seems to be its own peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.200" end="00:02:36.159" style="s2">thing and but I will talk to you more</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.409" end="00:02:38.470" style="s2">about that next week and but that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.159" end="00:02:40.930" style="s2">an example of why differentiation at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.470" end="00:02:42.670" style="s2">aspect level seems useful you also pick</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.930" end="00:02:44.590" style="s2">up differences between men and women at</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.670" end="00:02:47.049" style="s2">the aspect level that aren&#39;t obvious at</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.590" end="00:02:49.900" style="s2">the trade level as well so you can think</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.049" end="00:02:51.670" style="s2">about the model says you know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.900" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">model that operates at different levels</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.670" end="00:02:55.450" style="s2">of resolution and low resolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.610" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">representations are good for one set of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.450" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">operations and higher resolution</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:01.870" style="s2">representations are good for other</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:03.340" style="s2">purposes and the purpose of course is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.870" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">predict at least that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.340" end="00:03:07.540" style="s2">primary scientific purposes and so you</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.340" style="s2">pick the level of analysis that gives</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.540" end="00:03:11.319" style="s2">you the most prediction and perhaps also</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.340" end="00:03:14.890" style="s2">the most utility in terms of formulating</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.319" end="00:03:16.500" style="s2">scientific theories so and so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.890" end="00:03:18.879" style="s2">concentrate a little bit more today on</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.500" end="00:03:21.569" style="s2">openness per se so openness to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.879" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">experience fragments into intellect and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.569" end="00:03:25.060" style="s2">openness proper and I think the right</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.680" end="00:03:28.090" style="s2">way to think about intellect is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.060" end="00:03:29.560" style="s2">it&#39;s the personality instantiation of IQ</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.090" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">roughly speaking and the reason I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">that is because well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.299" end="00:03:36.579" style="s2">working memory predicts intellect quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:39.069" style="s2">nicely and working memory tests are very</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.579" end="00:03:41.319" style="s2">very highly correlated with G and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.069" end="00:03:43.780" style="s2">specifically G being the first factor</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.319" end="00:03:44.980" style="s2">that you pull out of any set of IQ tests</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.780" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">right that that&#39;s the technical</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.980" end="00:03:50.380" style="s2">definition of G you set up sets of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">questions do a factor analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.380" end="00:03:54.130" style="s2">extract out the first factor which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:56.829" style="s2">roughly equivalent by the way to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.130" end="00:03:58.750" style="s2">total or to that to the mean of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.829" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">items if it&#39;s if there&#39;s a one factor</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.750" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">solution it&#39;s not much different than</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:06.310" style="s2">the average so the average is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:08.230" style="s2">factor that&#39;s that that where the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.310" end="00:04:11.049" style="s2">hypothesis is that every single item</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.230" end="00:04:12.099" style="s2">loads equally on that factor because</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.049" end="00:04:14.139" style="s2">you&#39;re adding them all up and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.099" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">dividing them by the number so it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.139" end="00:04:17.320" style="s2">different than a factor analysis</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.400" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">sometimes you&#39;ll hear people like Steve</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.320" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">and Jay Google did this when he was</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:23.110" style="s2">complaining about IQ back in the 90s he</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:24.099" style="s2">said a factor and a factor analysis like</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.110" end="00:04:27.430" style="s2">a factor is just a mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.099" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">abstraction it&#39;s like well yeah so is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.430" end="00:04:31.599" style="s2">the average you think it&#39;s the average</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">of a set of numbers real and answer that</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.599" end="00:04:35.860" style="s2">question is depends on how you define</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:37.240" style="s2">real you can use it for certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.860" end="00:04:38.310" style="s2">functions which is a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.240" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">definition of real</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.310" end="00:04:42.480" style="s2">as far as I&#39;m concerned but when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:44.160" style="s2">questions like that you have to define</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.480" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">both your terms and you do that somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.160" end="00:04:49.800" style="s2">arbitrarily anyways people with high IQs</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:51.390" style="s2">tend to think that they&#39;re smart which</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.800" end="00:04:53.160" style="s2">is and that&#39;s right and so then they can</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.390" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">to describe themselves as smart if you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.160" end="00:04:56.640" style="s2">give them the opportunity to do that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:04:58.230" style="s2">then that shows up when you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.640" end="00:05:00.210" style="s2">questions about their problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.230" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">ability and that loads mostly on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.210" end="00:05:04.620" style="s2">intellect and so it isn&#39;t even obvious</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:07.050" style="s2">that there&#39;s any real utility in</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.620" end="00:05:09.510" style="s2">assessing intellect from the self-report</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.050" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">perspective when you could replace that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.510" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">with an IQ test because the IQ test is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:16.410" style="s2">way more accurate so but that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:17.670" style="s2">some sense you think about the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.410" end="00:05:19.470" style="s2">five factor model you know where</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.670" end="00:05:22.650" style="s2">intelligence slots it slots in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.470" end="00:05:24.870" style="s2">underneath opens now the openness proper</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.650" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">part of openness to experience which</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.870" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">which I tend to think about as</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:30.900" style="s2">creativity you can use that at least as</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">a shorthand to sort of aid your</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.900" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">understanding of what it is creativity</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:38.130" style="s2">seems related to IQ in that more people</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:39.930" style="s2">with higher IQs are likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.130" end="00:05:41.910" style="s2">creative or if you take people who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.930" end="00:05:43.230" style="s2">noted for their creativity there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.910" end="00:05:46.190" style="s2">high probability that they&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.230" end="00:05:50.550" style="s2">higher IQ but there&#39;s more to it than IQ</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.190" end="00:05:52.890" style="s2">and and what what creativity seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.550" end="00:05:54.390" style="s2">associated with then again depends on</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.890" end="00:05:56.640" style="s2">whether or not on how you define</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.390" end="00:05:59.310" style="s2">creativity because you could define it</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.640" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">as the sum total of creative</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.310" end="00:06:02.370" style="s2">achievements that you&#39;ve made in your</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:04.830" style="s2">life which would be the actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.370" end="00:06:06.960" style="s2">production of say artifacts of one form</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.830" end="00:06:09.600" style="s2">or another performances or inventions or</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.960" end="00:06:11.130" style="s2">artworks or or what-have-you we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.600" end="00:06:13.200" style="s2">over the dimensions in the middle in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.130" end="00:06:15.240" style="s2">minute or you could also define it as</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.200" end="00:06:17.100" style="s2">the proclivity to engage in creative</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.240" end="00:06:19.140" style="s2">thought and I think we&#39;ll start with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.100" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">that first so what does it mean to think</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.140" end="00:06:25.160" style="s2">creatively it&#39;s it&#39;s sort of like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">something like this you imagine that I</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.160" end="00:06:29.940" style="s2">toss you out an idea and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:31.620" style="s2">probability that when I toss you that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.940" end="00:06:34.230" style="s2">idea that that will trigger off other</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.620" end="00:06:36.060" style="s2">ideas in your imagination so you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.230" end="00:06:37.350" style="s2">think about it as a threshold issue if</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.060" end="00:06:39.420" style="s2">you&#39;re not very creative I&#39;ll throw you</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.350" end="00:06:41.370" style="s2">an idea and hardly any other ideas will</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.420" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">be triggered and the ones that will be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.370" end="00:06:45.630" style="s2">triggered are going to be very closely</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:48.330" style="s2">associated with that initial idea so</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.630" end="00:06:50.070" style="s2">let&#39;s say I toss each of you an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.110" style="s2">I asked you to think tell me the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.070" end="00:06:54.480" style="s2">thing that comes to mind okay so what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.110" end="00:06:56.820" style="s2">would see first is that the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.480" end="00:06:58.470" style="s2">that comes to mind for you the first</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.820" end="00:07:00.500" style="s2">thing that comes to mind in like in all</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.470" end="00:07:02.610" style="s2">likelihood we&#39;d be shared by many of you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.500" end="00:07:04.530" style="s2">okay so then you can think about that as</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.610" end="00:07:06.570" style="s2">a common response right and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.530" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">less creative response and then there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.570" end="00:07:10.650" style="s2">be some things that come to mind for you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:12.180" style="s2">that are that they&#39;re so idiosyncratic</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.650" end="00:07:14.460" style="s2">that you&#39;re the only person that thinks</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.180" end="00:07:16.650" style="s2">that and no one can understand it well</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.460" end="00:07:19.200" style="s2">that&#39;s also not exactly creative because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.650" end="00:07:20.730" style="s2">the thing that you for something to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.200" end="00:07:22.680" style="s2">creative it has to be novel and useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.730" end="00:07:25.410" style="s2">at the same time that&#39;s sort of rough</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.680" end="00:07:28.050" style="s2">definition creative something creative</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.410" end="00:07:29.670" style="s2">is novel and useful and obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.050" end="00:07:31.580" style="s2">know there&#39;s a there&#39;s a certain amount</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.670" end="00:07:34.950" style="s2">of judgment that goes along with that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.580" end="00:07:36.690" style="s2">clearly but if it&#39;s too novel then no</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.950" end="00:07:38.820" style="s2">one else can understand it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.690" end="00:07:41.190" style="s2">unlikely to be useful so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.820" end="00:07:42.390" style="s2">a there&#39;s a range of convenience so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.190" end="00:07:44.130" style="s2">anyways if you want to decide if</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.390" end="00:07:46.890" style="s2">something&#39;s creative like what we would</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.130" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">do for I could say to you okay in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.890" end="00:07:51.030" style="s2">next three minutes I want you to write</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:53.460" style="s2">down all the uses you can think of for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.030" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">brick so okay so someone tell me your</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.460" end="00:08:05.910" style="s2">use for a brick breaking windows yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:08.820" style="s2">okay what else can use a brick for build</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.910" end="00:08:12.140" style="s2">a wall it&#39;s very small wall haha a wall</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.820" end="00:08:16.950" style="s2">for ant and what else</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.140" end="00:08:18.600" style="s2">paperweight okay okay well so you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.950" end="00:08:21.630" style="s2">the idea you&#39;re not feeling very multi</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.600" end="00:08:24.900" style="s2">today obviously but so so you see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.630" end="00:08:26.550" style="s2">so if we gathered your responses say I</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.900" end="00:08:28.440" style="s2">said you have to think of 20 items that</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.550" end="00:08:31.380" style="s2">20 things that that you could do with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.440" end="00:08:32.940" style="s2">brick then a bunch of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.380" end="00:08:33.960" style="s2">you thought would be the same and some</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.940" end="00:08:35.340" style="s2">people would come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.960" end="00:08:36.930" style="s2">different like yours was reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.340" end="00:08:38.490" style="s2">different than one about using it as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:39.660" style="s2">publish stone for your feet but someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.490" end="00:08:41.820" style="s2">else might come up with that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.660" end="00:08:44.010" style="s2">it&#39;s a good creative response because</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.820" end="00:08:47.280" style="s2">it&#39;s unexpected and it you could</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.010" end="00:08:49.320" style="s2">actually do it you know so anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.280" end="00:08:52.740" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a graph of probability of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.320" end="00:08:55.260" style="s2">response right and the more probable the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.740" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">less creative roughly speaking it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.260" end="00:08:58.770" style="s2">the only criteria though because you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.270" style="s2">also have to look at utility so if I</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.770" end="00:09:01.980" style="s2">said okay you&#39;ve got three minutes to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.270" end="00:09:02.760" style="s2">write down as many uses as you can think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.980" end="00:09:04.470" style="s2">of for a brick</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.760" end="00:09:05.640" style="s2">I would score that in a variety of ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.470" end="00:09:07.020" style="s2">the first thing I would do is</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.640" end="00:09:09.570" style="s2">just figure out how many uses you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.020" end="00:09:10.830" style="s2">generated that&#39;s called fluency and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.570" end="00:09:12.210" style="s2">could also do that I could just say</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.830" end="00:09:13.770" style="s2">write down as many words as you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.210" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">begin with the letter s in three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.770" end="00:09:17.220" style="s2">or that begin with the letter C or</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:19.620" style="s2">four-letter words that begin with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.220" end="00:09:21.960" style="s2">letter D no I can I can constrain it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.620" end="00:09:24.870" style="s2">if I counted how many words you</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.960" end="00:09:26.250" style="s2">generated if I had an IQ measure and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.870" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">had a measure of how many words you</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.250" end="00:09:30.390" style="s2">generated IQ plus the number of words</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">that you generated would be a better</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.390" end="00:09:35.070" style="s2">predictor of your creativity than just</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.580" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">IQ so there&#39;s this fluency element</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.070" end="00:09:39.240" style="s2">that&#39;s and so that&#39;s something like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:40.770" style="s2">rate at which you can produce say verbal</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.240" end="00:09:44.300" style="s2">ideas and one of the things we do know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.770" end="00:09:47.100" style="s2">about about the creativity dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.300" end="00:09:48.990" style="s2">openness is that it is associated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.100" end="00:09:52.220" style="s2">fluency and it&#39;s also associated with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">originality and originality would be how</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.220" end="00:09:59.190" style="s2">improbable your use was compared to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:10:01.260" style="s2">uses generated by other people so so</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.190" end="00:10:02.460" style="s2">anyway so you can think of you get</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.260" end="00:10:04.230" style="s2">thrown an idea and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.460" end="00:10:05.940" style="s2">probability that that will Co activate</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.230" end="00:10:08.370" style="s2">other ideas and if it Co activates many</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.940" end="00:10:10.290" style="s2">other ideas that&#39;s like fluency and if</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.370" end="00:10:12.510" style="s2">it co activates ideas that are quite</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.290" end="00:10:14.400" style="s2">distant from the original idea something</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.510" end="00:10:17.340" style="s2">like that and you could you could track</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.400" end="00:10:19.020" style="s2">distance by comparing it to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.340" end="00:10:20.880" style="s2">probability that other people have</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.020" end="00:10:22.920" style="s2">generated it then that&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.880" end="00:10:25.950" style="s2">indication of creativity so they have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.920" end="00:10:26.700" style="s2">be unlikely many unlikely responses that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.950" end="00:10:28.350" style="s2">are useful</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.700" end="00:10:30.030" style="s2">that&#39;s what creativity is roughly</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.350" end="00:10:31.830" style="s2">speaking and then you can tracks innate</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.030" end="00:10:33.000" style="s2">it in two different dimensions so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.830" end="00:10:34.800" style="s2">creative thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.000" end="00:10:37.290" style="s2">but then creative achievement would be</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.800" end="00:10:38.880" style="s2">the ability to take those original ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.290" end="00:10:40.320" style="s2">and then actually to implement them in</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.880" end="00:10:42.090" style="s2">the world and that&#39;s obviously much more</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">different than merely being creative and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.090" end="00:10:47.430" style="s2">so and then what creativity is depends</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:49.530" style="s2">on which of those measurement routes</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.430" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">that you take now I developed a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.530" end="00:10:54.750" style="s2">questionnaire it&#39;s one of my students</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:56.460" style="s2">Shelley Carson about Jesus just about 30</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.750" end="00:10:58.260" style="s2">years ago now 20 years ago I guess</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.460" end="00:10:59.940" style="s2">called the creative achievement</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.260" end="00:11:02.370" style="s2">questionnaire and I&#39;ll show you that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.940" end="00:11:05.490" style="s2">here and I&#39;ll show you some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.370" end="00:11:07.410" style="s2">things that are interesting about it you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.490" end="00:11:09.030" style="s2">know you hear very frequently people say</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.410" end="00:11:11.670" style="s2">things like everyone&#39;s creative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.030" end="00:11:13.050" style="s2">like that&#39;s wrong okay it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.670" end="00:11:14.850" style="s2">just as wrong as saying that everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.050" end="00:11:16.470" style="s2">extroverted first of all you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.850" end="00:11:18.210" style="s2">pretty damn smart to be creative because</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.470" end="00:11:19.139" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re just going to get to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.210" end="00:11:21.509" style="s2">where other people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.139" end="00:11:24.899" style="s2">already got and that&#39;s not creative by</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.509" end="00:11:26.220" style="s2">definition so so being fast and being</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.899" end="00:11:27.389" style="s2">out there at the front of things really</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:29.009" style="s2">makes a difference and then you also</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.389" end="00:11:30.809" style="s2">have to have these divergent thinking</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.009" end="00:11:32.850" style="s2">capabilities and that&#39;s part of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.809" end="00:11:34.319" style="s2">trait structure and creative people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.850" end="00:11:36.629" style="s2">really different than non creative</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.859" end="00:12:00.119" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a real it&#39;s a real myth</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.169" end="00:12:02.189" style="s2">statement to make the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.119" end="00:12:03.809" style="s2">everyone&#39;s creative it&#39;s just simply not</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.189" end="00:12:05.759" style="s2">the case it&#39;s a matter of wishful</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.809" end="00:12:07.019" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s like saying that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.759" end="00:12:08.609" style="s2">is intelligent it&#39;s like well if</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.019" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">everyone is intelligent and then the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.609" end="00:12:12.569" style="s2">term loses all of its meaning because</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.459" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">the other thing you want to be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.569" end="00:12:21.600" style="s2">about here is that don&#39;t be thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.160" end="00:12:25.079" style="s2">that creativity is such a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.600" end="00:12:26.489" style="s2">it&#39;s a high-risk high-return strategy so</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.079" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re creative you just try this</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.489" end="00:12:29.459" style="s2">there&#39;s creative people in this room man</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:31.499" style="s2">you guys are going to have a hell of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.459" end="00:12:33.480" style="s2">time monetizing your creativity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.499" end="00:12:35.489" style="s2">virtually impossible it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.480" end="00:12:37.110" style="s2">difficult because first of all let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.489" end="00:12:39.089" style="s2">you make an original product you think</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.110" end="00:12:40.319" style="s2">the world will beat a pathway to your</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.089" end="00:12:42.360" style="s2">door if you build a better mousetrap</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.319" end="00:12:45.149" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s complete rubbish it</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.360" end="00:12:47.249" style="s2">isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t true in the least if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.149" end="00:12:50.160" style="s2">make a good creative product you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.249" end="00:12:52.290" style="s2">probably solved about 5% of your problem</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.160" end="00:12:53.999" style="s2">because then you have marketing which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.290" end="00:12:55.829" style="s2">insanely difficult and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.999" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">sales and then you have customer support</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.829" end="00:12:59.669" style="s2">and then you have to build an</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:01.139" style="s2">organization and you have to if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.669" end="00:13:03.419" style="s2">really novel you have to tell people</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.139" end="00:13:04.889" style="s2">what the hell the thing is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.419" end="00:13:07.410" style="s2">built this future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.889" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">right and so it&#39;s available for people</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.410" end="00:13:11.309" style="s2">online how do you market that no one</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:13.049" style="s2">knows what that is and that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.309" end="00:13:14.249" style="s2">problem if you wrote a book well then</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.049" end="00:13:15.899" style="s2">you have the problem that another</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.249" end="00:13:17.429" style="s2">million people have also written a book</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.899" end="00:13:18.839" style="s2">but if you produce something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.429" end="00:13:20.879" style="s2">completely new and doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.839" end="00:13:23.039" style="s2">category people can&#39;t search for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.879" end="00:13:24.989" style="s2">online how are they going to find it so</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.039" end="00:13:27.869" style="s2">you just have and then you have pricing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.989" end="00:13:29.939" style="s2">problems and it&#39;s really unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.869" end="00:13:32.100" style="s2">difficult to produce something creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.939" end="00:13:32.990" style="s2">and then monetize it and even worse if</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.100" end="00:13:34.240" style="s2">you&#39;re the creative</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.990" end="00:13:36.890" style="s2">let&#39;s say you have a spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:38.030" style="s2">invention you&#39;ve got no money right</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.890" end="00:13:40.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve got no customers</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.030" end="00:13:41.990" style="s2">those are big problems and so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.190" end="00:13:43.250" style="s2">go and you find a venture capitalist we</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.990" end="00:13:44.780" style="s2">start with family and friends because</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.250" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">that&#39;s how it works you raise money for</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.780" end="00:13:48.170" style="s2">your product you raise money from your</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:49.820" style="s2">family and friends that&#39;s assuming you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.170" end="00:13:51.530" style="s2">have family and friends that have some</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.820" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">money and that they&#39;re going to give it</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.530" end="00:13:55.160" style="s2">to you and most people aren&#39;t in that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:56.840" style="s2">situation so it&#39;s a terrible barrier</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.160" end="00:13:58.130" style="s2">right off the bat and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.840" end="00:14:00.200" style="s2">you&#39;re putting your family and friends</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.130" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">it&#39;s substantial financial risk because</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.200" end="00:14:03.650" style="s2">the probability that your stupid idea is</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:05.960" style="s2">going to make money is virtually zero</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.650" end="00:14:08.030" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a really brilliant idea and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.960" end="00:14:09.470" style="s2">so then let&#39;s say well you get past</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.030" end="00:14:11.450" style="s2">family and friends and you get venture</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.470" end="00:14:13.550" style="s2">capitalist capitalists involved because</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.450" end="00:14:15.950" style="s2">that&#39;s often the next step or an angel</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.550" end="00:14:17.660" style="s2">investor that&#39;s there&#39;s their steps in</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.660" end="00:14:21.980" style="s2">angel investor that&#39;s some rich guy that</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.090" end="00:14:24.140" style="s2">you happen to meet some manner in some</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.980" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">way who&#39;s who&#39;s into this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.140" end="00:14:27.530" style="s2">and is willing to provide you with some</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.820" end="00:14:30.590" style="s2">money to get your product off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.530" end="00:14:33.530" style="s2">well how much of your product is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.590" end="00:14:36.200" style="s2">person going to take well most of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.530" end="00:14:38.150" style="s2">most of it and then if you get a venture</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.200" end="00:14:40.010" style="s2">and no wonder because you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.150" end="00:14:41.660" style="s2">have any money how are you going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.010" end="00:14:43.550" style="s2">bargain for control over your product</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.660" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">he&#39;ll just say well do you want the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.550" end="00:14:46.490" style="s2">money or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">and if your answer is no then he&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.490" end="00:14:50.660" style="s2">and do something else with his money</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:52.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no shortage of</p>

<p begin="00:14:52.280" end="00:14:55.070" style="s2">because there&#39;s a million things you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.840" end="00:14:57.140" style="s2">do with it so you&#39;re not in a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.070" end="00:14:58.520" style="s2">bargaining position and then if you get</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.140" end="00:15:00.050" style="s2">venture capitalists involved they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.520" end="00:15:01.460" style="s2">take another big chunk and maybe if</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.050" end="00:15:03.590" style="s2">they&#39;re not very straight with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.460" end="00:15:04.970" style="s2">they&#39;ll just throw you out because maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.590" end="00:15:06.470" style="s2">by that point in the company&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.970" end="00:15:07.670" style="s2">development you&#39;re nothing but a pain in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.470" end="00:15:10.130" style="s2">the neck because what do you know about</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.670" end="00:15:12.470" style="s2">marketing and sales and customer service</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.130" end="00:15:14.210" style="s2">and building an organization and running</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.470" end="00:15:17.030" style="s2">a business like you don&#39;t have a clue so</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.210" end="00:15:19.670" style="s2">why do they need you so even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.030" end="00:15:21.410" style="s2">successful at generating a new idea and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.670" end="00:15:23.300" style="s2">you put it into a business the</p>

<p begin="00:15:23.300" end="00:15:28.400" style="s2">of the of the idea are going to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.430" end="00:15:29.990" style="s2">some money from it is very very low so</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.400" end="00:15:31.970" style="s2">don&#39;t be thinking that creativity is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.990" end="00:15:35.000" style="s2">such a is such a something you would</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.970" end="00:15:37.070" style="s2">want to curse yourself with now you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.000" end="00:15:39.020" style="s2">it&#39;s not all bad because it opens up</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.070" end="00:15:40.400" style="s2">avenues of experience for creative</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.020" end="00:15:42.380" style="s2">people that aren&#39;t available to people</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.400" end="00:15:44.810" style="s2">who aren&#39;t creative but it definitely is</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.380" end="00:15:46.400" style="s2">a high-risk high-return strategy you</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.810" end="00:15:49.339" style="s2">know so the overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.400" end="00:15:50.990" style="s2">probability is that you will fail but a</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.339" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">small proportion of creative people</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.990" end="00:15:57.020" style="s2">succeed spectacularly and so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.730" style="s2">lottery in some sense you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.020" end="00:16:00.650" style="s2">going to lose but if you don&#39;t lose you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.730" end="00:16:02.360" style="s2">could win big and that keeps a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.650" end="00:16:03.650" style="s2">creative people going but also they</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.360" end="00:16:05.029" style="s2">don&#39;t really have much choice in it</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.650" end="00:16:08.060" style="s2">because if you&#39;re a creative person</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.029" end="00:16:09.770" style="s2">you&#39;re like a fruit tree that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.060" end="00:16:11.870" style="s2">bearing fruit so you don&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.770" end="00:16:13.850" style="s2">you can suppress it but it&#39;s very bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.870" end="00:16:15.140" style="s2">for you you know the creative people</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.850" end="00:16:17.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve worked with is if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.140" end="00:16:20.450" style="s2">creative they&#39;re miserable so they have</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.270" end="00:16:22.670" style="s2">to do it but and and you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.450" end="00:16:25.520" style="s2">real joy and pleasure in it and and the</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.520" end="00:16:29.510" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:31.370" style="s2">it&#39;s an intelligent it&#39;s certainly not a</p>

<p begin="00:16:31.370" end="00:16:36.080" style="s2">through life so and you know whenever I</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.080" end="00:16:39.140" style="s2">guys should listen to this because I</p>

<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">or an artist or or any of the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.230" end="00:16:50.510" style="s2">number of things that you might be find</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:52.940" style="s2">a way to make money and then practice</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.510" end="00:16:55.580" style="s2">your craft on the side because you will</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.940" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2">starve to death otherwise now some for</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.580" end="00:16:59.330" style="s2">some of you that won&#39;t be true but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:00.709" style="s2">a tiny minority your best bet is to find</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.330" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">a job that will keep body and soul</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.709" end="00:17:05.030" style="s2">together and parse off some time that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:07.250" style="s2">you can pursue your creative things</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.030" end="00:17:08.540" style="s2">because then well as a long-term</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.250" end="00:17:10.550" style="s2">strategy you medium to long term</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.540" end="00:17:11.959" style="s2">strategy it&#39;s a better one but it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.550" end="00:17:14.179" style="s2">incredibly difficult for people</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.959" end="00:17:16.520" style="s2">musicians for example it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.179" end="00:17:18.559" style="s2">difficult for new musicians to monetize</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.520" end="00:17:19.400" style="s2">their their craft even if they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.559" end="00:17:22.819" style="s2">really good at it</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.400" end="00:17:25.189" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s well so anyway so don&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.819" end="00:17:26.510" style="s2">so I say well everyone&#39;s not everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.189" end="00:17:27.980" style="s2">not creative and everybody goes oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.510" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">that&#39;s terrible it&#39;s like it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.980" end="00:17:30.950" style="s2">terrible it&#39;s not something it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.630" style="s2">self-evident that you would curse</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.950" end="00:17:36.290" style="s2">someone with high levels of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.630" end="00:17:38.030" style="s2">so alright so here&#39;s how our creative</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.290" end="00:17:40.429" style="s2">achievement questionnaire works what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.030" end="00:17:42.800" style="s2">did essentially was we thought up how</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.429" end="00:17:45.500" style="s2">many domains there are in which you</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.800" end="00:17:46.670" style="s2">might be creative and this is remember</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.500" end="00:17:48.110" style="s2">when you&#39;re designing a questionnaire</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.670" end="00:17:49.580" style="s2">you want to be over-inclusive because</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.110" end="00:17:51.710" style="s2">the statistics will take care of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.580" end="00:17:55.790" style="s2">right so you can you can take a big area</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.710" end="00:17:58.190" style="s2">of potential you can take a large area</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.790" end="00:18:00.120" style="s2">and aim your questionnaire at it and you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.190" end="00:18:02.490" style="s2">can do statistics post talk to see</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.120" end="00:18:03.750" style="s2">you&#39;re covering the area if if the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.490" end="00:18:05.580" style="s2">things that you&#39;re measuring are nicely</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.750" end="00:18:06.929" style="s2">correlated they&#39;re this you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.580" end="00:18:08.580" style="s2">something about them that&#39;s similar if</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.929" end="00:18:10.049" style="s2">they&#39;re not correlated then maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.580" end="00:18:11.549" style="s2">measuring two different things and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.049" end="00:18:13.590" style="s2">can get rid of one of them that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.549" end="00:18:15.960" style="s2">so we did start with a pretty wide range</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.590" end="00:18:18.570" style="s2">we thought okay well what domains can</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.960" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">you be creative in visual arts painting</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.570" end="00:18:22.500" style="s2">and sculpture then we had experts sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:24.929" style="s2">of rank order levels of achievement</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.500" end="00:18:27.299" style="s2">within those domains and so if you are a</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.929" end="00:18:29.010" style="s2">painter you can 0 gives you I have no</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.299" end="00:18:30.750" style="s2">training or recognised talent in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.010" end="00:18:34.169" style="s2">area okay so you really want to keep an</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.750" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">eye on the zeros alright so then I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.169" end="00:18:38.549" style="s2">taken lessons people have commented on</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.470" style="s2">my talents I have won a prize my work is</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.549" end="00:18:43.490" style="s2">being critiqued in national publications</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.470" end="00:18:45.690" style="s2">all right so you get you get you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.490" end="00:18:47.820" style="s2">zero to seven points but you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.690" end="00:18:50.100" style="s2">indicate more than no maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.820" end="00:18:52.130" style="s2">happened to you more than once so and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.100" end="00:18:55.380" style="s2">what happens this is interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.130" end="00:18:57.059" style="s2">higher you are up in this hierarchy the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.380" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">more likely it is that those things have</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.059" end="00:19:00.390" style="s2">happened to you more than once and</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:02.250" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s another example of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.390" end="00:19:05.669" style="s2">weird thing called the Pareto principle</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.250" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">or Prices law which is that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.669" end="00:19:09.090" style="s2">good things happen to you the</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">probability that more good things will</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.090" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2">happen increases right so because once</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:14.460" style="s2">you&#39;re famous people give you all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:17.070" style="s2">of opportunities to do other things</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.460" end="00:19:19.470" style="s2">right so your your your success doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.070" end="00:19:22.740" style="s2">go like this goes like this zero zero</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.470" end="00:19:24.779" style="s2">zero skyrocket that&#39;s how it works but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.740" end="00:19:27.029" style="s2">getting from zero getting from zero to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.779" end="00:19:28.590" style="s2">one if you&#39;re starting a business the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.029" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">hardest customer you&#39;ll ever get is your</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.590" end="00:19:31.380" style="s2">first one and then the second hardest</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">one will be your second one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.380" end="00:19:34.649" style="s2">virtually impossible to get a first</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:36.179" style="s2">customer because they&#39;re going to say to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.649" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">you first of all you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.179" end="00:19:39.539" style="s2">selling to people who are basically</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:41.250" style="s2">conservative and there aren&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.539" end="00:19:43.559" style="s2">be evaluate they&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.250" end="00:19:45.059" style="s2">willing or able to evaluate whether your</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.559" end="00:19:46.380" style="s2">damn product is good for anything and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.059" end="00:19:48.600" style="s2">they&#39;ll say well who are your other</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.380" end="00:19:50.370" style="s2">customers and if your answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.600" end="00:19:51.870" style="s2">well we don&#39;t have any it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.370" end="00:19:54.450" style="s2">then what they&#39;re going to be the first</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.870" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">one no because people don&#39;t stick their</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.450" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">necks out at all</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:20:00.630" style="s2">not a bit ever and so unless you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.559" end="00:20:01.919" style="s2">established in the market especially if</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.630" end="00:20:03.390" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with a big company you</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.919" end="00:20:06.149" style="s2">can just bloody well forget it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.390" end="00:20:08.100" style="s2">a three year sales cycle anyways it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.149" end="00:20:09.750" style="s2">RIT because big corporations move very</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.100" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">very slowly and you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.750" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">find a small company that doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:13.260" style="s2">much money who would be willing to use</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">your stoop</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.260" end="00:20:16.980" style="s2">product for nothing if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:20.220" style="s2">nice to them and you get one customer</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.980" end="00:20:22.650" style="s2">that way it&#39;s very very difficult and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.220" end="00:20:24.030" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll end up you know and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.650" end="00:20:26.460" style="s2">do you think the royalty just out of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.030" end="00:20:28.110" style="s2">curiosity so I&#39;ve written a book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.460" end="00:20:29.910" style="s2">going to be published by penguin Random</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.110" end="00:20:31.410" style="s2">House and in January what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.910" end="00:20:33.840" style="s2">the royalty is for an author on a book</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.410" end="00:20:35.370" style="s2">so you make something creative you get a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.840" end="00:20:38.300" style="s2">percentage of the sale what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.370" end="00:20:43.050" style="s2">the percentage is just out of curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.300" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">guess yeah it&#39;s like 5% so think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.050" end="00:20:47.820" style="s2">that so that means that you make your</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:49.170" style="s2">thing and 95% of it belongs to someone</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.820" end="00:20:50.850" style="s2">else and that&#39;s that things are going</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.170" end="00:20:52.350" style="s2">quite well for you and it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.850" end="00:20:54.690" style="s2">matter what you manufacture or produce</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.350" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s about what you can expect sales</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.690" end="00:21:00.480" style="s2">marketing distribution it eats it all up</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:01.860" style="s2">so us all well anyways you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.480" end="00:21:03.090" style="s2">these things because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.860" end="00:21:07.010" style="s2">self-evident okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.090" end="00:21:09.330" style="s2">so seems to be working all by itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.010" end="00:21:11.220" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s take a look well how</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.330" end="00:21:13.110" style="s2">else can you have creative achievement</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.220" end="00:21:15.180" style="s2">well you can be a musician I have no</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.110" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">training or recognize Talent recordings</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.180" end="00:21:18.390" style="s2">of my composition have been sold</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:19.920" style="s2">publicly that&#39;s the top end my</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.390" end="00:21:22.110" style="s2">composition has been copyrighted</p>

<p begin="00:21:31.260" end="00:21:34.800" style="s2">creative people in here that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.580" end="00:21:37.290" style="s2">impressive so there must be 10 or 11</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.800" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">people in here oh that&#39;s cool so how</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.060" end="00:21:54.630" style="s2">well so what you can see is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.890" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">rapid drop-off in the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.630" end="00:21:58.500" style="s2">who say yes how many of you fit into</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:22:02.340" style="s2">category zero I have no training a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.500" end="00:22:05.010" style="s2">recognised talent in this area yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.340" end="00:22:07.230" style="s2">okay zero is the median score on all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.010" end="00:22:09.180" style="s2">these median is the score that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.230" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">most likely for people to have or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.180" end="00:22:13.140" style="s2">different than the mean median score is</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:14.280" style="s2">zero so what&#39;s the median score and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.140" end="00:22:18.150" style="s2">entire creative achievement</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.280" end="00:22:20.100" style="s2">questionnaire zero you you add up all</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.150" end="00:22:23.100" style="s2">over all thirteen domains the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.100" end="00:22:25.860" style="s2">difficult score is zero so that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.100" end="00:22:27.010" style="s2">creative people are there&#39;s zero</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.860" end="00:22:31.450" style="s2">creative</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.010" end="00:22:37.930" style="s2">at all yes everybody has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.450" end="00:22:39.850" style="s2">degree not really creative well the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.930" end="00:22:42.100" style="s2">thing is you could say that people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.850" end="00:22:44.110" style="s2">people all people are creative and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.100" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">all people can generate ideas but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.110" end="00:22:46.660" style="s2">issue isn&#39;t whether or not you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.190" style="s2">generate ideas it&#39;s whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.660" end="00:22:49.420" style="s2">can generate ideas that are different</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:51.190" style="s2">from the ideas that other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.420" end="00:22:53.320" style="s2">generate that&#39;s the critical issue</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.190" end="00:22:55.750" style="s2">because it mean it depends on how you</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.320" end="00:22:57.910" style="s2">define it you could you well the novelty</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.750" end="00:22:59.290" style="s2">is a huge part of it but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.910" end="00:23:00.910" style="s2">sort of built into the definition of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.290" end="00:23:03.340" style="s2">creative it has to be novel and useful</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.910" end="00:23:04.930" style="s2">and if your idea that you generate is</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.340" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">the same as the idea that a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.930" end="00:23:08.650" style="s2">other people have it&#39;s not it&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:10.660" style="s2">fair enough and if you define creativity</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.650" end="00:23:12.010" style="s2">that way then everyone&#39;s creative but</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.660" end="00:23:14.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a foolish way of defining</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.010" end="00:23:16.810" style="s2">creativity because everyone does it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.290" end="00:23:22.510" style="s2">and we know that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.810" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">something novel about creativity useful</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.510" end="00:23:28.570" style="s2">idea today the Integra&#39;s all seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:31.660" style="s2">artistic and well as requiring specific</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.570" end="00:23:38.170" style="s2">non-creative skills for example music</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.660" end="00:23:40.750" style="s2">and require yeah are there ways to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.170" end="00:23:42.130" style="s2">creative outside there well let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.750" end="00:23:44.560" style="s2">through the rest of the domains because</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.130" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">we did include domains that aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.560" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">aren&#39;t artistic and yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.070" style="s2">engineering is a good example of that or</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.670" end="00:23:52.900" style="s2">writing nonfiction that those things</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.070" end="00:23:55.150" style="s2">tend to tilt more in the intellect</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.900" end="00:23:57.400" style="s2">direction but I&#39;m concentrating most</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.150" end="00:23:59.410" style="s2">particularly here on sort of creativity</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.400" end="00:24:04.090" style="s2">that would be associated with openness</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.410" end="00:24:05.710" style="s2">so yeah okay so dance well it&#39;s roughly</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.090" end="00:24:07.720" style="s2">the same as music so we won&#39;t we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.710" end="00:24:10.600" style="s2">move forward into that architectural</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.720" end="00:24:12.340" style="s2">design my architectural design my</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.600" end="00:24:13.870" style="s2">architectural design has been recognized</p>

<p begin="00:24:23.530" end="00:24:28.450" style="s2">that&#39;s another example of high risk high</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.050" end="00:24:30.640" style="s2">returns so probably you won&#39;t write a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.450" end="00:24:33.250" style="s2">book if you write a book probably no one</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.640" end="00:24:35.230" style="s2">will publish it if you publish it almost</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.250" end="00:24:37.510" style="s2">certainly no one will buy it</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.230" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">so you see you see what I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.510" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2">exclusion the exclusion criteria there</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:43.419" style="s2">are so there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">thoroughly they&#39;re so difficult because</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.419" end="00:24:47.049" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to write a book even</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:49.720" style="s2">a bad one you have to work a long time</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.049" end="00:24:51.669" style="s2">to write a bad book and then your book</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.720" end="00:24:53.559" style="s2">has to be pretty damn good before you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.669" end="00:24:55.210" style="s2">going to get it published and and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.559" end="00:24:56.950" style="s2">also have to know about know how to go</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.210" end="00:24:58.690" style="s2">about getting it published that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.950" end="00:25:00.400" style="s2">you don&#39;t send a book to a publisher by</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.690" end="00:25:03.429" style="s2">the way they don&#39;t want your stupid book</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.400" end="00:25:05.620" style="s2">they want a summary of the book they</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.429" end="00:25:07.480" style="s2">want an outline of the book they want</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.620" end="00:25:08.980" style="s2">three chapters of the book they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.480" end="00:25:10.630" style="s2">know who the hell you are and why anyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.980" end="00:25:13.000" style="s2">should listen to you they want to know</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.630" end="00:25:15.309" style="s2">what other books your book is like and</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.000" end="00:25:17.260" style="s2">most importantly perhaps they want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.309" end="00:25:19.450" style="s2">know where it would sit in a bookshelf</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.260" end="00:25:21.789" style="s2">in a bookstore and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.450" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">is that and I have trouble this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.789" end="00:25:25.179" style="s2">trouble with the books that I write is</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:26.710" style="s2">no one was where to put them that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.179" end="00:25:28.090" style="s2">big problem because then the marketing</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.710" end="00:25:29.320" style="s2">people don&#39;t know how to market them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.090" end="00:25:31.150" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s because they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.320" end="00:25:32.620" style="s2">creative than usual it doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.150" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a place that you can put the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.620" end="00:25:36.100" style="s2">book where people can find it then</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:37.630" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to publish it and even</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.100" end="00:25:39.400" style="s2">if you do you can&#39;t sell it because no</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.630" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">one can find it so you just think about</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.400" end="00:25:42.850" style="s2">the difficulties and being a successful</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:45.220" style="s2">author you&#39;re not going to write a book</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.850" end="00:25:46.539" style="s2">it&#39;s too hard there&#39;s no damn way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.220" end="00:25:47.620" style="s2">going to get it published and if you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.539" end="00:25:49.480" style="s2">it probably won&#39;t be a very good</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.620" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">publisher then they have to do a really</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.480" end="00:25:53.980" style="s2">good job of selling it and marketing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:56.559" style="s2">then you have to enter the market at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.980" end="00:25:58.150" style="s2">right time right and then you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.559" end="00:25:59.890" style="s2">reviewed by the right people and then it</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.150" end="00:26:01.929" style="s2">has to be put in the right places it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.890" end="00:26:03.880" style="s2">like most what happens is your book will</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.929" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">go out for a week no one will buy it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.880" end="00:26:10.870" style="s2">it&#39;ll disappear and that&#39;s if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.530" end="00:26:14.169" style="s2">done 99.99% of things right so okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.870" end="00:26:15.549" style="s2">creative writing our humor my humor has</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.169" end="00:26:17.049" style="s2">been recognized in a national</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.549" end="00:26:18.669" style="s2">publication that&#39;s at the top and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.049" end="00:26:20.049" style="s2">written a joke or cartoon that has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.669" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">published I&#39;ve written jokes for other</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:26.650" style="s2">comedian inventions I regularly find</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.730" end="00:26:28.299" style="s2">novel uses for household objects I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.650" end="00:26:30.220" style="s2">built a prototype of one of my designed</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.299" end="00:26:31.900" style="s2">inventions I&#39;ve sold one of my</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.220" end="00:26:33.640" style="s2">inventions to people I know has anyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.900" end="00:26:41.230" style="s2">in here built a prototype of a designed</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.640" end="00:26:44.309" style="s2">invention no one okay has anyone in here</p>

<p begin="00:26:44.309" end="00:26:51.940" style="s2">one to three people yes three people how</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.909" end="00:26:54.700" style="s2">about I&#39;ve sketched out an invention and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.940" end="00:26:58.090" style="s2">worked on design flaws how many people</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.700" end="00:26:59.889" style="s2">so maybe two or three yeah I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.090" end="00:27:01.330" style="s2">this was an engineering class and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.889" end="00:27:03.249" style="s2">likelihood there would be more people in</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.330" end="00:27:05.230" style="s2">not telling but that this is more in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.249" end="00:27:07.119" style="s2">domain it&#39;s not the exactly the artsy</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.230" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">end of the creativity distribution it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.119" end="00:27:11.710" style="s2">more on the ideas and and mechanical end</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:13.889" style="s2">of it and and and that&#39;s a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.710" end="00:27:17.830" style="s2">way of thinking about it I would say so</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.889" end="00:27:19.389" style="s2">um scientific discovery I do not have</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.830" end="00:27:21.759" style="s2">training or recognizability in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.389" end="00:27:23.350" style="s2">field I received a scholarship based on</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.759" end="00:27:24.970" style="s2">my work in science or medicine how many</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.350" end="00:27:27.840" style="s2">people have received a scholarship based</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.970" end="00:27:30.190" style="s2">in their work on science and medicine</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.840" end="00:27:31.899" style="s2">okay nobody so we don&#39;t have anybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.190" end="00:27:33.159" style="s2">that goes up that high I&#39;ve won a prize</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.899" end="00:27:36.580" style="s2">at a science fair or other local</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.159" end="00:27:38.679" style="s2">competition anybody there yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.580" end="00:27:40.239" style="s2">maybe two or three four people there so</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.679" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">that means we&#39;ve got four people in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.239" end="00:27:47.350" style="s2">class of about 150 who hit the third the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:49.210" style="s2">second level of scientific discovery</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.350" end="00:27:51.009" style="s2">anybody received a grant to pursue their</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.210" end="00:27:52.450" style="s2">work in science and medicine its highly</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.009" end="00:27:54.789" style="s2">unlikely you guys are mostly too young</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.450" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">to have had that happen to you okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.789" end="00:28:01.480" style="s2">so theater and film anybody who&#39;s at how</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.030" end="00:29:16.140" style="s2">digitally it&#39;s like yeah yeah yeah I rat</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.140" end="00:29:21.299" style="s2">it&#39;s actually well that&#39;s that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.650" end="00:29:23.370" style="s2">one of the terrible cut offs is that not</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.299" end="00:29:24.900" style="s2">only do you have to be right and have</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.370" end="00:29:26.309" style="s2">yourself together and produce the proper</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.900" end="00:29:27.870" style="s2">thing but the market has to open it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.309" end="00:29:29.669" style="s2">exactly that moment so that you can walk</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.870" end="00:29:31.200" style="s2">through there has to be a demand so</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.669" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">people won&#39;t buy anything that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.200" end="00:29:35.220" style="s2">don&#39;t have a crying need for because</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">they have priority say it&#39;s imagine</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.220" end="00:29:38.549" style="s2">everybody has ten priorities and ten</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:40.350" style="s2">number ten is important but no one ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.549" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">does it and number eight is important</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.350" end="00:29:43.980" style="s2">that no one ever does it and so you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:46.169" style="s2">to go talk to someone to buy what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.980" end="00:29:47.549" style="s2">have and that has to be priority one or</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.169" end="00:29:49.020" style="s2">two for them because they&#39;ll say oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.549" end="00:29:50.370" style="s2">that&#39;s good we really need it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.020" end="00:29:51.780" style="s2">priority eight it&#39;s like forget it</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.370" end="00:29:53.309" style="s2">they&#39;ll never buy your thing because</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.780" end="00:29:54.750" style="s2">they never get to priority eight on</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.309" end="00:29:57.480" style="s2">their list of ten priorities they only</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.750" end="00:29:58.380" style="s2">get down to like priority four so and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.480" end="00:29:59.940" style="s2">then the other thing that will happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.380" end="00:30:01.770" style="s2">too is if you go up try to sell your</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.940" end="00:30:03.270" style="s2">product you won&#39;t know who to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.770" end="00:30:04.770" style="s2">and you&#39;ll end up spending ninety five</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.270" end="00:30:07.140" style="s2">percent of your time this is especially</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.770" end="00:30:09.929" style="s2">true in companies with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.140" end="00:30:10.980" style="s2">will talk to you right obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.929" end="00:30:12.330" style="s2">those aren&#39;t the people who ever make</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.980" end="00:30:14.130" style="s2">any decisions so they&#39;ll tell you all</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.330" end="00:30:15.419" style="s2">sorts of good things about your product</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.130" end="00:30:16.860" style="s2">and how interested they are but they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.419" end="00:30:19.020" style="s2">never buy it because they can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.860" end="00:30:20.100" style="s2">make decisions and you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.020" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">get to the people who make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.100" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">because other people who know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:26.419" style="s2">that have already got there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:29.340" style="s2">not you so that&#39;s very difficult as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.419" end="00:30:32.970" style="s2">culinary arts my recipes have been</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.340" end="00:30:35.190" style="s2">published nationally anyone how about I</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.970" end="00:30:37.080" style="s2">often experiment with rest misses</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.190" end="00:30:39.929" style="s2">purposeful experimentation right not</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.080" end="00:30:42.059" style="s2">accidental experimentation yes sorry</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.929" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">alright my recipes would be published in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.059" end="00:30:47.070" style="s2">the local cookbook anyone know okay okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.049" style="s2">well you get the you get the point right</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:50.490" style="s2">you see you see how this works it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.049" end="00:30:52.950" style="s2">well here are ways you can be creative</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.490" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">and here are strata of accomplishment</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.950" end="00:30:58.340" style="s2">within those ways and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:58.340" style="s2">question is what does it look like yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.659" end="00:31:05.610" style="s2">yes yes yes fair enough and and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.330" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">probably needs to be updated to reflect</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.610" end="00:31:09.510" style="s2">that so so there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:11.760" style="s2">distribution of scores</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.510" end="00:31:13.320" style="s2">now that&#39;s dismal that&#39;s a dismal thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.760" end="00:31:15.060" style="s2">to look at you have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.320" end="00:31:19.500" style="s2">why look at this</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.060" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">zero right the median person has not</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.500" end="00:31:22.970" style="s2">done anything creative ever in their</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:25.530" style="s2">life with anything on any dimension</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.970" end="00:31:26.760" style="s2">right it&#39;s really important to know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.530" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">and then you have these horrible people</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.760" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">out here right they do everything they</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:35.490" style="s2">do everything price is law here&#39;s prices</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">law this is something to hammer into</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.490" end="00:31:40.460" style="s2">your heart the square root of the number</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.440" end="00:31:42.900" style="s2">of people in a domain do 50% of the work</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.460" end="00:31:44.550" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s go through that you have</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.900" end="00:31:47.130" style="s2">ten employees three of them do half the</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.550" end="00:31:49.680" style="s2">work makes sense that&#39;s reasonable you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.130" end="00:31:52.410" style="s2">have a hundred employees ten of them do</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.680" end="00:31:55.290" style="s2">half the work that&#39;s problem so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.410" end="00:31:56.820" style="s2">other 90% are doing the other half who</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.290" end="00:31:59.390" style="s2">cares about them you have 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.820" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">employees 100 of them do have to work</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.390" end="00:32:04.970" style="s2">right so here&#39;s that here&#39;s a nasty</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">little law as your company grows</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.970" end="00:32:10.770" style="s2">incompetence grows in it exponentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:12.990" style="s2">and confidence grows linearly got it</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.770" end="00:32:14.700" style="s2">right because it with ten it&#39;s three who</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.990" end="00:32:16.230" style="s2">are doing half the work but at 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.700" end="00:32:17.970" style="s2">it&#39;s 100 that are doing half the work so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.230" end="00:32:20.010" style="s2">nine thousand nine hundred of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.970" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">employees are doing as much as the best</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.010" end="00:32:24.900" style="s2">100 you might not even know who the best</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">100 are but probably they know and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.900" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">their peers know too and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:30.270" style="s2">things that&#39;s really interesting when</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:32.010" style="s2">big companies start to shake which means</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.270" end="00:32:33.960" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ve had a bad quarter too bad</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.010" end="00:32:36.510" style="s2">quarters and the stock price starts to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.960" end="00:32:37.860" style="s2">tip down and the people the hot people</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.510" end="00:32:39.840" style="s2">who have options are not very happy</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.860" end="00:32:41.520" style="s2">about that and maybe they start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.840" end="00:32:43.470" style="s2">announce layoffs all the hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.520" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">who have opportunities leave and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.470" end="00:32:46.650" style="s2">the ones who were doing half the work so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.090" style="s2">boy that puts your company in a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.650" end="00:32:50.730" style="s2">rough situation because now you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.090" end="00:32:52.260" style="s2">the ninety nine hundred people left over</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.730" end="00:32:54.030" style="s2">who we&#39;re only doing half the work and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.260" end="00:32:56.520" style="s2">the next time you announced layoffs the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.030" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">next most productive hundred leave and</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.520" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">so then you&#39;re left with nobody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:04.230" style="s2">productive at a massive overhead payroll</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:06.810" style="s2">prices law you can look that up to Sol a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.230" end="00:33:08.490" style="s2">price to Sol a price is a guy who is</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.810" end="00:33:10.230" style="s2">looking at scientific productivity and</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.490" end="00:33:12.930" style="s2">one of the things he found was when he</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.230" end="00:33:15.510" style="s2">was looking at PhD students is that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.930" end="00:33:17.280" style="s2">median number of publications for a PhD</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.510" end="00:33:21.090" style="s2">graduate when he did his work which was</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.280" end="00:33:23.190" style="s2">in the early 60s was one okay half as</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.090" end="00:33:25.500" style="s2">many had - half as many as that had</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.190" end="00:33:27.210" style="s2">three half as many as that had four -</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.500" end="00:33:28.860" style="s2">real stepped out and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.210" end="00:33:29.850" style="s2">corollaries of that is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.860" end="00:33:31.890" style="s2">number of people who are hyper</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.850" end="00:33:34.980" style="s2">productive and that&#39;s these people out</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.890" end="00:33:37.020" style="s2">here and if you were graphing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.980" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">distribution let&#39;s say you graphed how</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.020" end="00:33:41.730" style="s2">many people in that population of 300</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">had $10,000 in a savings account it</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.730" end="00:33:46.590" style="s2">would look very much like this some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:48.299" style="s2">them would have are some of some of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.590" end="00:33:50.820" style="s2">would most people would have like no</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.299" end="00:33:52.049" style="s2">savings whatsoever the median person</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.820" end="00:33:54.270" style="s2">would have no savings whatsoever and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.049" end="00:33:55.950" style="s2">then you go up here where the 1% is they</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.270" end="00:33:58.140" style="s2">have all the money but the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.950" end="00:33:59.880" style="s2">want to understand about that 1% issue</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.140" end="00:34:02.820" style="s2">that you always hear about is that it</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.880" end="00:34:03.900" style="s2">applies in every single realm where</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.820" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">there&#39;s difference in creative</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.900" end="00:34:08.190" style="s2">production every realm doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:09.780" style="s2">number of Records produce number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.190" end="00:34:12.629" style="s2">records sold number of compositions</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.780" end="00:34:15.869" style="s2">written so here&#39;s here&#39;s an example 5</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.629" end="00:34:18.659" style="s2">composers produce the music that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.869" end="00:34:21.149" style="s2">occupies 50% of the classical repertoire</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.659" end="00:34:24.179" style="s2">by Bach Beethoven Brahms</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.149" end="00:34:26.490" style="s2">Tchaikovsky who&#39;s Mozart that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.179" end="00:34:27.960" style="s2">those 5 ok so here&#39;s something cool so</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.490" end="00:34:30.659" style="s2">you take all the music those people</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.960" end="00:34:33.929" style="s2">wrote 5 percent of the music all those</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.659" end="00:34:35.850" style="s2">people wrote occupies 50 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.929" end="00:34:38.790" style="s2">music that of their writing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.850" end="00:34:41.159" style="s2">played so not only do almost all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.790" end="00:34:42.869" style="s2">composers never get a listen but even</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.159" end="00:34:44.700" style="s2">among the composers and you get a list</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.869" end="00:34:47.940" style="s2">and almost none of their music ever gets</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.700" end="00:34:49.800" style="s2">played so so then that&#39;s that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.940" end="00:34:51.659" style="s2">example of this price is law of scaling</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.800" end="00:34:53.639" style="s2">so and it applies to all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.659" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">like number of hockey goals scored is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.639" end="00:34:58.910" style="s2">also distributed this way number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:35:00.570" style="s2">basketball basketball basketball</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.910" end="00:35:03.270" style="s2">successfully put through the hoop</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.570" end="00:35:05.010" style="s2">follows the same distribution size of</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.270" end="00:35:08.040" style="s2">cities follows the same distribution</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.010" end="00:35:11.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird it&#39;s a weird law and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.040" end="00:35:11.700" style="s2">you can think about it in part why does</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.100" end="00:35:13.740" style="s2">this happen</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.700" end="00:35:16.859" style="s2">law imagine what happens when you play</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.740" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">Monopoly what happens everybody has the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.859" end="00:35:21.390" style="s2">same amount of money to begin with right</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">so then you start playing it&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.390" end="00:35:25.109" style="s2">a random game well some people start to</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:27.180" style="s2">win a bit some people start to lose a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.109" end="00:35:28.770" style="s2">bit and then if you win the probability</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.180" end="00:35:30.840" style="s2">that you&#39;ll keep winning starts to</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.770" end="00:35:32.970" style="s2">increase and if you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.840" end="00:35:34.410" style="s2">vulnerability increases as you lose and</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.970" end="00:35:36.780" style="s2">then maybe you&#39;ve got to say six people</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.410" end="00:35:40.260" style="s2">play Monopoly soon one person has zero</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.780" end="00:35:41.970" style="s2">what happens when they have zero they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.260" end="00:35:42.450" style="s2">out of the game so zero is a weird</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.970" end="00:35:43.950" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.450" end="00:35:47.099" style="s2">because when you hit zero you&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.950" end="00:35:48.869" style="s2">the game so so then if you keep playing</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.099" end="00:35:51.660" style="s2">people start to stack up at zero right</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.869" end="00:35:53.490" style="s2">what happens at the end of the game one</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.660" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">person has all the property and all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.490" end="00:35:57.750" style="s2">money and everyone else has none right</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:00.150" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens if you play an</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.750" end="00:36:02.339" style="s2">iterated trading game to its final</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.150" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">conclusion and that&#39;s part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.339" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">law in a sense that&#39;s underlying this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.790" style="s2">kind of distribution so it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:10.950" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.790" end="00:36:12.690" style="s2">necessarily of structural inequality</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.950" end="00:36:14.730" style="s2">it&#39;s built into the system at a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.690" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">level than that so you know people talk</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.730" end="00:36:18.630" style="s2">about all the time about how unfair it</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">is that 1% of the population has the</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.630" end="00:36:23.730" style="s2">vast amount of the money and 1% of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:26.760" style="s2">1% has most of that money and 1% of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.730" end="00:36:29.430" style="s2">1% of the 1% has most of that money but</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.760" end="00:36:31.710" style="s2">it is a it&#39;s a it&#39;s an inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">conclusion of iterated trading games and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.710" end="00:36:36.150" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to fight it we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.070" style="s2">know how to take from the people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.150" end="00:36:39.839" style="s2">have and move it to the bottom without</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.070" end="00:36:42.810" style="s2">instantly moving back up to the top</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.839" end="00:36:45.270" style="s2">different people maybe but still back up</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.810" end="00:36:48.390" style="s2">to the top because even the 1% turns a</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.270" end="00:36:50.369" style="s2">lot like I think you have a 10% chance</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.390" end="00:36:52.710" style="s2">if I remember correctly you have a 10%</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.369" end="00:36:55.770" style="s2">chance of being in the top 1% for at</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.710" end="00:36:58.230" style="s2">least one year of your life and a 40%</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.770" end="00:36:59.880" style="s2">chance of being in the top 10% for at</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.230" end="00:37:01.560" style="s2">least one year in your life that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.880" end="00:37:03.569" style="s2">Canada in the u.s. it&#39;s less so in</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.560" end="00:37:05.730" style="s2">Europe so there&#39;s a fair bit of churning</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.569" end="00:37:07.800" style="s2">at the top end it&#39;s not the same people</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.730" end="00:37:09.869" style="s2">all the time you have the money but it</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.800" end="00:37:20.369" style="s2">is a tiny fraction of the people all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.869" end="00:37:24.450" style="s2">time who have all the money yeah people</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.369" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">inside redistribute to recreate no not</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.450" end="00:37:27.950" style="s2">usually</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:32.670" style="s2">I mean they do but it&#39;s attenuated</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.950" end="00:37:34.410" style="s2">because the people mean if you reach up</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.670" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">the entire company and put everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.410" end="00:37:37.230" style="s2">somewhere else there&#39;s some probability</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:38.790" style="s2">that some of those people would rise to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.230" end="00:37:41.099" style="s2">the top that weren&#39;t at the top before</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.790" end="00:37:43.319" style="s2">but in that company that that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.099" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">generally what happens people get stuck</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.319" end="00:37:48.270" style="s2">in their niche and they don&#39;t move so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:50.010" style="s2">yeah this is you kill you wonder</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.270" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">sometimes well how can companies die so</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.010" end="00:37:53.640" style="s2">quickly well they go they go into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:56.100" style="s2">death spiral it&#39;s almost impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.640" end="00:37:57.780" style="s2">them to get out of so and it happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.100" end="00:37:59.790" style="s2">happen extraordinarily quickly this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.780" end="00:38:01.740" style="s2">why you know the typical fortune 500</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.790" end="00:38:04.050" style="s2">company only last 30 years that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.740" end="00:38:06.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not that easy for these Bale moths</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.050" end="00:38:08.100" style="s2">to continue existance across time so and</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.870" end="00:38:10.110" style="s2">it&#39;s because it&#39;s really easy for</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.100" end="00:38:12.330" style="s2">something to die it&#39;s very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.110" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">it will be built it&#39;s very unlikely that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.330" end="00:38:16.080" style="s2">it will be successful and once</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">successful it&#39;s very unlikely that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.080" end="00:38:20.190" style="s2">will continue to duplicate its success</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:21.510" style="s2">because the underlying landscape shifts</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.190" end="00:38:24.660" style="s2">on it and it doesn&#39;t know where to go</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.510" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s also partly because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.660" end="00:38:28.770" style="s2">that easy to integrate creative people</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">into your company right you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.770" end="00:38:31.320" style="s2">don&#39;t want them at the bottom because</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.090" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.320" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">doing what they&#39;re told to do so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.090" end="00:38:36.360" style="s2">filter out a lot of them at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:37.470" style="s2">and then you need them at the top but</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.360" end="00:38:39.840" style="s2">they&#39;ve already been filtered out and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.470" end="00:38:42.180" style="s2">also creative people are troublesome to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.840" end="00:38:44.700" style="s2">work with because they&#39;re always how do</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.180" end="00:38:47.130" style="s2">you evaluate a creative person you all</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.700" end="00:38:49.230" style="s2">you almost can&#39;t by definition because</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.130" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">they keep coming up with new things and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.230" end="00:38:52.500" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a good evaluative</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">strategy for a new thing it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.500" end="00:38:55.590" style="s2">new if you had a good evaluative</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:38:57.360" style="s2">strategy for it right it would have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.590" end="00:38:59.430" style="s2">be the member of a class that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.360" end="00:39:01.500" style="s2">already encountered substantially so</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.430" end="00:39:07.380" style="s2">anyway so the take-home lesson from this</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.500" end="00:39:09.570" style="s2">is zero right right and then that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.380" end="00:39:11.490" style="s2">that&#39;s like a graph of money monetary</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.570" end="00:39:12.810" style="s2">distribution as well and the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.490" end="00:39:15.120" style="s2">problem with being at zero is it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.810" end="00:39:17.130" style="s2">difficult to get out of zero this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.120" end="00:39:18.780" style="s2">also why people get stuck in poverty you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.130" end="00:39:20.400" style="s2">know you can&#39;t get a bank account if</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.780" end="00:39:23.250" style="s2">you&#39;re if you don&#39;t have any money right</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.400" end="00:39:24.810" style="s2">if there&#39;s a bunch of things that start</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.250" end="00:39:27.360" style="s2">to move against you when you&#39;re at zero</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.810" end="00:39:29.540" style="s2">that you can&#39;t shake it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.360" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">to get out of the to get out of the that</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.540" end="00:39:38.760" style="s2">the pit here because zero is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:39.870" style="s2">pit okay so now we&#39;ve got the creative</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.760" end="00:39:41.220" style="s2">achievement questionnaire and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.870" end="00:39:43.110" style="s2">going to take your score and your score</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.220" end="00:39:45.270" style="s2">is summed across all the categories and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.110" end="00:39:47.160" style="s2">and and all the exemplars of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.270" end="00:39:49.410" style="s2">categories that you&#39;ve chosen so then</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.160" end="00:39:51.780" style="s2">the question is well can you predict</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.410" end="00:39:54.060" style="s2">creative achievement and and this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.780" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">this is this is how we did it with this</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.060" end="00:39:57.720" style="s2">was construct delegation the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.130" style="s2">we wanted to know was was the creative</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.720" end="00:40:00.570" style="s2">achievement questionnaire actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.130" end="00:40:03.630" style="s2">associated with something that you might</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.570" end="00:40:07.950" style="s2">regard as creativity okay so we got a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.630" end="00:40:09.540" style="s2">number of students to come in and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.950" end="00:40:11.610" style="s2">gave them a collage kit</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.540" end="00:40:13.290" style="s2">and so then everybody got exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.610" end="00:40:15.270" style="s2">same tip and then we had to make a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.290" end="00:40:17.550" style="s2">collage out of the collage kit then we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.270" end="00:40:19.950" style="s2">have five artists rate the collage for</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.550" end="00:40:21.510" style="s2">quality and then we averaged across the</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.950" end="00:40:22.920" style="s2">ratings now the first thing you would do</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.510" end="00:40:25.290" style="s2">if you did that is because you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.920" end="00:40:28.680" style="s2">might think well can artists actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.290" end="00:40:30.690" style="s2">come up with a a measure of how creative</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.680" end="00:40:33.600" style="s2">a collage is and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.690" end="00:40:35.670" style="s2">actually technical if all say you guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.600" end="00:40:38.310" style="s2">are the panel if all of you identify the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.670" end="00:40:40.620" style="s2">same collages as of high quality and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.310" end="00:40:42.540" style="s2">same ones as of low quality then we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.620" end="00:40:44.850" style="s2">assume that there&#39;s something about your</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.540" end="00:40:46.590" style="s2">judgement that&#39;s like independent of</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.850" end="00:40:48.750" style="s2">your idiosyncrasies we could say well</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.590" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">there is a judgment that emerges as a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.750" end="00:40:52.890" style="s2">consensus across artists and the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:56.130" style="s2">thing we found was that there was there</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.890" end="00:40:58.980" style="s2">is quite a high correlation between each</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.130" end="00:41:00.420" style="s2">artists judgment of the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.980" end="00:41:01.950" style="s2">collages I can&#39;t remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.420" end="00:41:04.590" style="s2">inter-rater reliability was but it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.950" end="00:41:06.510" style="s2">something like 0.8 it was really high so</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.590" end="00:41:08.370" style="s2">it was clear that trained artists could</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.510" end="00:41:10.290" style="s2">make reliable judgments about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.370" end="00:41:12.480" style="s2">quality of collages because you had to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.290" end="00:41:13.710" style="s2">check that out first because if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.480" end="00:41:15.330" style="s2">all over the place you got no measure</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.710" end="00:41:17.820" style="s2">right it&#39;s like everyone&#39;s using a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.330" end="00:41:19.530" style="s2">different rulers got no measure so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.820" end="00:41:21.960" style="s2">have to be using the same ruler well we</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.530" end="00:41:24.360" style="s2">found that the correlation between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.960" end="00:41:26.750" style="s2">creative evaluation of collages and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.360" end="00:41:29.370" style="s2">total taq was 0.59 which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.750" end="00:41:32.190" style="s2">mind-boggling I told you last time that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.370" end="00:41:36.200" style="s2">under 5% of published social studies</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.190" end="00:41:39.180" style="s2">social science studies have a are</p>

<p begin="00:41:41.430" end="00:41:46.590" style="s2">0.6 and if you if you square it point 5</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.000" end="00:41:48.660" style="s2">squared is 25 percent of the variance</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.590" end="00:41:50.970" style="s2">point 6 squared is 36 percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.660" end="00:41:53.430" style="s2">variance point 6 is a lot more than 0.5</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.970" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">and point 5 is unheard of and so the</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.180" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">we use the divergent thinking tests and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.309" end="00:42:42.819" style="s2">I told you about those already&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:45.010" style="s2">many uses can you think of for a brick</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.819" end="00:42:46.839" style="s2">for example and so those are scored</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.010" end="00:42:48.490" style="s2">according to fluency how many answers</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.839" end="00:42:50.799" style="s2">you provide and then also originality</p>

<p begin="00:42:50.799" end="00:42:56.200" style="s2">provide and that was nicely correlated</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.819" end="00:43:34.359" style="s2">psychometric tests so it means that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.440" end="00:43:36.700" style="s2">creativity is a real thing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.359" end="00:43:38.619" style="s2">first thing both in terms of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.700" end="00:43:40.930" style="s2">creatively that would be the divergent</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.900" end="00:43:48.190" style="s2">thinking are quite tightly aligned so</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.450" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">that was good that&#39;s been a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.190" end="00:43:52.329" style="s2">influential paper I think it&#39;s got about</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:53.710" style="s2">500 citations now people use the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.329" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">creative achievement questionnaire a lot</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.710" end="00:43:57.220" style="s2">to assess creativity it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.359" end="00:43:59.680" style="s2">associated with a higher than average</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.680" end="00:44:02.349" style="s2">thing you see with creative people is</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.180" end="00:44:04.569" style="s2">that they tend especially if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.349" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">writers they tend the pathology that</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.569" end="00:44:08.440" style="s2">goes along with that is often manic</p>

<p begin="00:44:08.440" end="00:44:13.240" style="s2">because manic people become unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.910" end="00:44:15.369" style="s2">fluid I think they speak incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.240" end="00:44:18.280" style="s2">quickly they generate ideas like mad and</p>

<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">can have as a side effect creativity so</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:31.480" style="s2">this is a cool study I just found this</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.940" end="00:44:33.700" style="s2">one today it&#39;s a terror management study</p>

<p begin="00:45:42.430" end="00:45:46.180" style="s2">part of the idea that was put forth to</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.740" end="00:45:48.190" style="s2">say by people like Nietzsche was that</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.180" end="00:45:50.260" style="s2">one of the ways to fight back against</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.190" end="00:45:52.780" style="s2">existential anxiety and death anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.260" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">and all of that is to engage in creative</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.780" end="00:45:56.620" style="s2">production and so that was actually put</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">to the empirical test in this study so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.620" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">thought that was quite cool</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.940" end="00:46:10.330" style="s2">so there&#39;s another paper this was by</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.380" end="00:46:12.430" style="s2">Kaufmann and a couple of my students</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.330" end="00:46:15.010" style="s2">Jacob Hirsch and Colin Dion I&#39;m on that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.430" end="00:46:18.190" style="s2">paper as well near the end there they</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.010" end="00:46:20.500" style="s2">were interested in whether openness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.190" end="00:46:22.120" style="s2">intellect predicted different elements</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.500" end="00:46:23.740" style="s2">of creative achievements or goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.120" end="00:46:25.720" style="s2">your question about the differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.740" end="00:46:29.980" style="s2">between the artsy end of creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.720" end="00:46:32.350" style="s2">maybe the more practical idiot and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.980" end="00:46:33.750" style="s2">practical end associated for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.350" end="00:46:36.250" style="s2">with the proclivity to like nonfiction</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.750" end="00:46:40.570" style="s2">the Big Five personality dimension</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.250" end="00:46:42.370" style="s2">openness / intellect is the trait most</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.570" end="00:46:44.500" style="s2">closely associated with creativity and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.370" end="00:46:46.570" style="s2">creative achievement little is known</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.500" end="00:46:48.580" style="s2">however regarding the discriminant</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.570" end="00:46:52.360" style="s2">validity of its two aspects discriminant</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.580" end="00:46:54.040" style="s2">validity is whether one aspect predicts</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.360" end="00:46:55.540" style="s2">one set of things and the other aspect</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.040" end="00:46:57.700" style="s2">predicts a different set of things if</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.540" end="00:46:59.230" style="s2">there&#39;s no discriminant validity if they</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.700" end="00:47:01.360" style="s2">can&#39;t be used for different purposes</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.230" end="00:47:02.890" style="s2">then there&#39;s no point having them so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.360" end="00:47:04.630" style="s2">want to see that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.890" end="00:47:09.310" style="s2">capable of differentiating between</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.630" end="00:47:12.420" style="s2">between real world phenomena two of its</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.310" end="00:47:12.420" style="s2">aspects openness to experience</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.720" end="00:47:17.050" style="s2">reflecting cognitive engagement with</p>

<p begin="00:47:29.200" end="00:47:33.340" style="s2">totaling over a thousand participants we</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.570" end="00:47:35.320" style="s2">investigated the independent predictive</p>

<p begin="00:47:38.950" end="00:47:44.830" style="s2">and creative achievement across the Arts</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.900" end="00:47:46.300" style="s2">and Sciences we confirm that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.830" end="00:47:50.260" style="s2">that openness predicts creative</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.300" end="00:47:52.390" style="s2">achievement in the arts and intellect</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.260" end="00:47:54.220" style="s2">predicts creative achievement in the</p>

<p begin="00:47:55.960" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">that&#39;s IQ and divergent thinking</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.890" end="00:48:02.770" style="s2">indicated that the relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">intellect to scientific creativity may</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.770" end="00:48:05.980" style="s2">be due at least in part to these</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:06.730" style="s2">abilities lastly we found that</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.980" end="00:48:08.110" style="s2">extraversion</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.730" end="00:48:10.150" style="s2">additionally predicted creative</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.110" end="00:48:12.330" style="s2">achievement in the arts independently of</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.150" end="00:48:14.590" style="s2">openness so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.330" end="00:48:16.290" style="s2">creative achievement in the arts is</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.590" end="00:48:18.750" style="s2">actually a function of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.290" end="00:48:20.790" style="s2">higher-order trait plasticity right</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.750" end="00:48:22.610" style="s2">because plasticity was openness plus</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.790" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">extraversion and that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.610" end="00:48:26.730" style="s2">fundamentally with activation of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.410" style="s2">underlying dopaminergic system which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.730" end="00:48:31.110" style="s2">the system that mediates exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.410" end="00:48:32.880" style="s2">behavior so if you&#39;re dominated by that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.110" end="00:48:34.950" style="s2">the function of that system</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.880" end="00:48:36.440" style="s2">you&#39;re an exploratory gregarious person</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.950" end="00:48:41.180" style="s2">then you&#39;re more likely to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.440" end="00:48:45.630" style="s2">creative ability in the arts so</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.180" end="00:48:47.550" style="s2">apparently it&#39;s time stop yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.630" end="00:48:53.270" style="s2">that&#39;s the same student who always does</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.550" end="00:48:53.270" style="s2">that alright we&#39;ll see you on Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.820" end="00:48:58.010" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
