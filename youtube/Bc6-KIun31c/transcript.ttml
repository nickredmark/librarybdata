<p begin="00:03:04.120" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">organizations to deal with and most</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">recently I&#39;ve been writing the global</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:13.579" style="s2">guerrillas report and it&#39;s focused on</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:17.959" style="s2">the intersection of technology warfare</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.579" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">and politics started off with a focus on</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.959" end="00:03:23.209" style="s2">how that&#39;s changing our political</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:26.299" style="s2">structures and our ability to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.209" end="00:03:31.430" style="s2">problems and today I was hoping to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.299" end="00:03:34.430" style="s2">about how things have changed and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.430" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with that change three</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.430" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">parts first would be how the world has</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">changed to then how we&#39;ve changed and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:46.310" style="s2">then what we need to do in the future in</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">order to get do better um my general</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.310" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">premise is that the world is different</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:57.139" style="s2">than it was 25 years ago it&#39;s complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">everyone&#39;s familiar with complexity that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.139" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">means the world is and the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:07.870" style="s2">were faced facing are filled with</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:11.540" style="s2">nonlinearities and uncertainties and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.870" end="00:04:16.209" style="s2">those changes make things very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.540" end="00:04:16.209" style="s2">difficult to to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.579" end="00:04:21.780" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve interconnected at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.829" end="00:04:25.310" style="s2">an economic level we&#39;ve interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.780" end="00:04:28.050" style="s2">at a social level technology is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.310" end="00:04:31.490" style="s2">interconnecting us in ways that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.050" end="00:04:31.490" style="s2">not fully appreciating</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.620" end="00:04:37.930" style="s2">that environment changes the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.940" end="00:04:40.949" style="s2">the problems that we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.930" end="00:04:46.419" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a very chaotic at times and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.949" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">word not organizationally adept at</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.419" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">dealing with problems of that type um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">the world is also changing us and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:04:56.680" style="s2">know I go back to McLuhan and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:04:59.500" style="s2">written with you know how McLuhan talked</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.680" end="00:05:00.250" style="s2">about how technology is rewiring us at a</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.500" end="00:05:03.130" style="s2">very deep level</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.250" end="00:05:08.199" style="s2">it&#39;s rewiring our brains it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.130" end="00:05:09.789" style="s2">the way we think um and it&#39;s doing it on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.199" end="00:05:11.740" style="s2">a mass scale I mean we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.789" end="00:05:15.419" style="s2">social networks that have three and a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.740" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">half billion people interconnected and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.419" end="00:05:23.789" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve changed the way we think</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:25.780" style="s2">is is that it&#39;s a turning us from</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.789" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">solitary thinkers you know literary</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.780" end="00:05:30.490" style="s2">thinkers people who you know read and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:35.500" style="s2">then formulate opinions in in relative</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.490" end="00:05:37.720" style="s2">isolation towards people who think in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.500" end="00:05:39.400" style="s2">public who do pattern matching who look</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.720" end="00:05:41.050" style="s2">at bits and pieces of information and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.400" end="00:05:42.760" style="s2">then they assemble it into a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.050" end="00:05:45.450" style="s2">whole and they&#39;re doing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.760" end="00:05:47.740" style="s2">collective fashion and that you see</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.450" end="00:05:50.470" style="s2">incredible numbers of people now we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.740" end="00:05:53.139" style="s2">spend their whole day pattern matching</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.470" end="00:05:57.430" style="s2">and an extreme end of that you get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.139" end="00:06:03.820" style="s2">cue nods and you get the extremist</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.430" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">groups and then you get the development</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.820" end="00:06:08.830" style="s2">of a kind of a tribal ization McLuhan</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:10.630" style="s2">was always talking about you know how</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.830" end="00:06:12.250" style="s2">we&#39;re becoming tribal man and he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.630" end="00:06:15.580" style="s2">only at the beginning of this process</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.250" end="00:06:17.320" style="s2">he saw it back in the 60s but you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.580" end="00:06:19.630" style="s2">tribal man and thinks differently no</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.320" end="00:06:22.990" style="s2">tribal thinking is this different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.630" end="00:06:24.729" style="s2">it&#39;s us versus them either you believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.990" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">in my pattern or you don&#39;t believe in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.729" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">pattern the patterns can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">used and also to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.920" end="00:06:36.620" style="s2">make a case that other people are</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.280" end="00:06:38.390" style="s2">persecuting you and that they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.620" end="00:06:40.580" style="s2">doing bad things to you and that every</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.390" end="00:06:42.170" style="s2">bit of information that you see makes</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.580" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">the case and you share it with everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.170" end="00:06:48.850" style="s2">else and they all agree with the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:48.850" style="s2">you add to that that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.070" end="00:06:59.260" style="s2">so those are the changes but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:07:01.960" style="s2">is is that the complex problems that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.260" end="00:07:04.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve been facing and we face three</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.960" end="00:07:06.910" style="s2">somewhat so far this in the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.690" end="00:07:08.380" style="s2">years the first one was 9/11 then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.910" end="00:07:10.330" style="s2">financial crisis and most recently the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.380" end="00:07:12.580" style="s2">pandemic and those were you know started</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.330" end="00:07:15.720" style="s2">with the initial event but they took</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.580" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">decades to figure out and deal with and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.720" end="00:07:20.710" style="s2">they were hideously difficult to deal</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:24.010" style="s2">with over that period of time it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.710" end="00:07:26.350" style="s2">just 9/11 but it was the whole global</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.010" end="00:07:29.020" style="s2">war on terror the misdirection into our</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.430" end="00:09:59.770" style="s2">type now one of the things I dig into is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.050" end="00:10:03.220" style="s2">the idea of David Rowan felts Timman</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.770" end="00:10:07.500" style="s2">structure runfeldt was net networks and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.220" end="00:10:12.040" style="s2">network back in their early late 90s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.500" end="00:10:14.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a the timin structure is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.040" end="00:10:16.600" style="s2">kind of a layered approach to looking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.440" end="00:10:19.210" style="s2">the way we make decisions on a social</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.600" end="00:10:20.740" style="s2">level on a collective level and that he</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.210" end="00:10:22.810" style="s2">pauses that we have you know three</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.740" end="00:10:25.710" style="s2">established decision-making systems a</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.810" end="00:10:29.110" style="s2">you know a tribal decision-making system</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.710" end="00:10:30.830" style="s2">institutional and a market and that each</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.110" end="00:10:33.620" style="s2">of those developed</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.830" end="00:10:35.209" style="s2">over time and then we refine them from</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.620" end="00:10:38.330" style="s2">their raw state to into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.209" end="00:10:40.940" style="s2">a lot more effective than what they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.330" end="00:10:43.190" style="s2">when they initially started you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.940" end="00:10:44.690" style="s2">tribal most people would discount that</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.190" end="00:10:46.130" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually very important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.690" end="00:10:48.290" style="s2">you know he started off as they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.130" end="00:10:50.360" style="s2">the blood tribalism and the feudalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.290" end="00:10:53.959" style="s2">and then and now it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.360" end="00:10:56.480" style="s2">nationalism kind of a it allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.959" end="00:10:59.320" style="s2">have the kind of cool cohesion necessary</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.480" end="00:11:02.120" style="s2">to make decisions as a collective unit</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.320" end="00:11:06.380" style="s2">tribalism is important because if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.120" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">don&#39;t view someone else presenting you</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.380" end="00:11:12.770" style="s2">with information as somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:14.570" style="s2">related to you or connected to you you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.770" end="00:11:18.550" style="s2">often distrust the information that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.570" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">present it&#39;s an important component in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.550" end="00:11:27.560" style="s2">in coherent decision-making because of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:30.860" style="s2">what we&#39;re suffering right now is a you</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.560" end="00:11:32.180" style="s2">know a decline in tribalism is that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.860" end="00:11:33.950" style="s2">don&#39;t feel connected we don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.180" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">related we don&#39;t feel like we&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.950" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">the same tribe right now and so when</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:41.060" style="s2">people present information at the get-go</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:42.980" style="s2">many people would just immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.060" end="00:11:45.649" style="s2">discount like that information was</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.980" end="00:11:50.020" style="s2">mented to harmony meant to do me damage</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.649" end="00:11:54.040" style="s2">and if you&#39;re trying to make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.020" end="00:11:54.040" style="s2">as it collected as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.500" end="00:12:01.110" style="s2">social unit this is just pure poison it</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.280" end="00:12:05.070" style="s2">makes it makes for incoherent</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.110" end="00:12:07.890" style="s2">decision-making institutions you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.070" end="00:12:09.690" style="s2">bureaucracies basically you know max</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.890" end="00:12:11.460" style="s2">favors you know bureaucracy is you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.690" end="00:12:14.370" style="s2">kind of the cockroach of organizational</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.460" end="00:12:17.610" style="s2">structures that that infested almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.370" end="00:12:18.710" style="s2">every area of our lives lives but on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.610" end="00:12:22.260" style="s2">other hand it done</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.710" end="00:12:26.450" style="s2">it bureaucracy is great at mobilizing</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.260" end="00:12:30.150" style="s2">resources at analyzing information</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.450" end="00:12:32.130" style="s2">getting things done and it&#39;s the basis</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.150" end="00:12:33.990" style="s2">for which we have you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.130" end="00:12:35.580" style="s2">basis of science it&#39;s the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.990" end="00:12:39.150" style="s2">governance its basis of corporate</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.580" end="00:12:40.830" style="s2">architectures it&#39;s everywhere and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.150" end="00:12:43.050" style="s2">problem-solving system that we&#39;ve used</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.830" end="00:12:46.460" style="s2">effectively to do many many things over</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.050" end="00:12:49.980" style="s2">the past past uh four or five centuries</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.460" end="00:12:52.650" style="s2">and then the finally in markets markets</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.980" end="00:12:56.190" style="s2">are great at information discovery they</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.650" end="00:12:59.820" style="s2">are great allocating resources you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.190" end="00:13:01.110" style="s2">the early ones ripe for abuse but over</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.820" end="00:13:03.570" style="s2">time we learned to regulate them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.110" end="00:13:04.640" style="s2">control them and put them to effective</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.570" end="00:13:07.140" style="s2">use and they&#39;re the heart of capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.640" end="00:13:08.490" style="s2">so we have these three effective</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.140" end="00:13:12.840" style="s2">decision-making systems that we&#39;ve tamed</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.490" end="00:13:14.490" style="s2">over time and now we need to add a new</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.840" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">one and a new one that&#39;s made available</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.490" end="00:13:17.850" style="s2">because we&#39;re being rewired and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:19.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s the only kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">decision-making system that could handle</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.080" end="00:13:24.870" style="s2">the types of situations we find</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:28.080" style="s2">ourselves in in a complex global</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.870" end="00:13:32.190" style="s2">environment me and the only one that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.080" end="00:13:33.840" style="s2">actually handle the way we our internal</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.190" end="00:13:35.850" style="s2">decision-making systems because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.840" end="00:13:38.190" style="s2">been rewired and the old ones don&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:40.230" style="s2">to work in terms of allowing us to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.190" end="00:13:44.190" style="s2">maintain cohesion and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.230" end="00:13:45.840" style="s2">networked decision-making and people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.190" end="00:13:48.840" style="s2">have talked about that forever</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.840" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very amorphous you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.840" end="00:13:52.590" style="s2">tried to talk about it ten years ago it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.420" style="s2">was it was really kind of a non-starter</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.590" end="00:13:56.010" style="s2">because it was a lot of hand waving and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.420" end="00:13:59.070" style="s2">you know it&#39;s out there you kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.010" end="00:14:00.510" style="s2">it now we&#39;re starting to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.070" end="00:14:04.080" style="s2">what it is and it was made possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.510" end="00:14:06.510" style="s2">largely through what did the rise of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.080" end="00:14:07.580" style="s2">social networking that we started using</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.510" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">land in other places</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.580" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">back in 2001 and now is everywhere I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">mean we have a social network that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:17.030" style="s2">connects up three and a half billion</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:19.100" style="s2">people and one and then there&#39;s another</p>

<p begin="00:24:25.340" end="00:24:31.070" style="s2">all down and use network means to</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.070" end="00:24:34.430" style="s2">much like a control system on an</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.800" end="00:24:55.980" style="s2">Europe is pretty much ignoring it and</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.140" end="00:25:38.820" style="s2">Putin is the wealthiest man in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:40.350" style="s2">at least until the oil prices not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.820" end="00:25:42.860" style="s2">not maybe recently because the oil</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.350" end="00:25:42.860" style="s2">prices are down</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.340" end="00:25:50.149" style="s2">but that cross-ownership allows a kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.330" end="00:25:52.460" style="s2">of cohesive core to exist um I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.149" end="00:25:55.399" style="s2">that&#39;s a you know unproductive long term</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.460" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">I think the Chinese system has is has</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.399" end="00:26:01.309" style="s2">the potential to become they probably</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:04.129" style="s2">the the most oppressive governance</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.129" end="00:26:10.399" style="s2">can actually censor and control you at</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:13.429" style="s2">an individual level to a degree that</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.399" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">we&#39;d never ever seen before I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.429" end="00:26:17.539" style="s2">in the most oppressive countries of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.639" style="s2">past there was at least a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.539" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">leeway inside your own house or inside</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.639" end="00:26:24.830" style="s2">your own head and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.990" end="00:26:28.009" style="s2">something that you get get into that so</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.830" end="00:26:29.240" style="s2">um yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s refining the</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.009" end="00:26:34.360" style="s2">system that we&#39;re we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.240" end="00:26:37.340" style="s2">it&#39;s dynamic its connection chaotic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.360" end="00:26:39.499" style="s2">but it&#39;s the one we have and and and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.340" end="00:26:40.970" style="s2">the extra decision-making support we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.499" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">need in order to handle the problems</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.970" end="00:26:44.869" style="s2">that we have I mean for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:47.330" style="s2">network decision-making system in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.869" end="00:26:51.970" style="s2">u.s. provided 90 percent of the response</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.330" end="00:26:55.730" style="s2">to mitigating the the pandemic it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.970" end="00:26:57.860" style="s2">instituted the social distancing on its</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.730" end="00:26:59.659" style="s2">own without government support weeks</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.860" end="00:27:05.179" style="s2">before the government actually joined on</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.659" end="00:27:10.610" style="s2">board and it for demand destruction and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.179" end="00:27:13.429" style="s2">through coercion got corporations to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:17.690" style="s2">change the behavior you know close their</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.429" end="00:27:19.369" style="s2">doors or or go to online working so it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.690" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">did the heavy lifting on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.369" end="00:27:24.619" style="s2">I mean the government restrictions were</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:26.509" style="s2">just basically codifying or formalizing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.619" end="00:27:28.639" style="s2">what had already happened with this the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.509" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">social decision makers with a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.639" end="00:27:34.730" style="s2">decision making and it already occurred</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:36.139" style="s2">so um anyway anyone any questions or is</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.730" end="00:27:38.570" style="s2">that a good coverage I&#39;ve missed</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.139" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">something or or is that a lot of fire</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.570" end="00:27:41.860" style="s2">host you a little bit sorry about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.909" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">yeah I have about two years of reports</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.039" end="00:27:49.940" style="s2">and you know actually about three years</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:53.149" style="s2">reports that are writing on this you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.940" end="00:27:54.619" style="s2">know report a month in this last couple</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.149" end="00:27:56.110" style="s2">months I&#39;ve been doing a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.619" end="00:27:58.290" style="s2">steady stream of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.110" end="00:28:00.850" style="s2">and what I call a pandemic working paper</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.290" end="00:28:02.980" style="s2">so every day I kind of update it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.850" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">then and try to get you know a couple</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.980" end="00:28:08.440" style="s2">months out ahead of where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:10.120" style="s2">either debunking stuff or pointing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.440" end="00:28:12.400" style="s2">the right direction as to how things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.120" end="00:28:14.500" style="s2">going in it that seems to work with I</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.400" end="00:28:19.420" style="s2">run it all under a patreon it works</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.500" end="00:28:22.240" style="s2">pretty nicely right</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.420" end="00:28:24.400" style="s2">yeah the global guerrillas report it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.240" end="00:28:26.290" style="s2">like you know John rabe on patreon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.400" end="00:28:28.809" style="s2">a pretty straightforward good group of</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.290" end="00:28:32.890" style="s2">people they add to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.809" end="00:28:34.600" style="s2">value of the experience so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.890" end="00:28:37.480" style="s2">more in-depth that&#39;s where to go it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.600" end="00:28:40.690" style="s2">just sometimes I can there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.480" end="00:28:42.630" style="s2">information to process absolutely so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.690" end="00:28:45.370" style="s2">people want to start throwing their</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.630" end="00:28:46.870" style="s2">questions in the chat and then I can</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.370" end="00:28:50.130" style="s2">call on you and you can meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.870" end="00:28:56.169" style="s2">and ask your questions in the meantime</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.130" end="00:28:59.049" style="s2">John I was wondering so as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.169" end="00:29:00.970" style="s2">how do you know that you&#39;re part of some</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.049" end="00:29:02.380" style="s2">sort of network effect and then how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.970" end="00:29:05.559" style="s2">you kind of Milan eight those</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.380" end="00:29:08.290" style="s2">connections and make them stronger how</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.559" end="00:29:10.840" style="s2">would we be able to connect to networks</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.290" end="00:29:13.210" style="s2">and what are some tools that we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.840" end="00:29:18.250" style="s2">use to make those network connections</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.210" end="00:29:20.380" style="s2">stronger well my general premise is they</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.250" end="00:29:23.110" style="s2">in this current environment you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.380" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">as smart as your network all right</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.110" end="00:29:26.710" style="s2">because there&#39;s no way that you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:28.090" style="s2">you could verify all the information</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.710" end="00:29:30.669" style="s2">that&#39;s being thrown at you</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.090" end="00:29:32.410" style="s2">no way you could put it into you know</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.780" end="00:29:59.530" style="s2">one of those things you have to do bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.110" end="00:30:01.750" style="s2">by bit</p>

<p begin="00:30:32.310" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">go off the rails and they attack you so</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.620" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">you just have to act quickly try to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:43.950" style="s2">a diversity of sources cheese I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:46.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like in the last election before</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.950" end="00:30:50.370" style="s2">the the kind of political networks</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.410" end="00:30:51.840" style="s2">really became visible you know I looked</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.370" end="00:30:52.950" style="s2">at the my network and it was across the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.840" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">board I mean they were voting for</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.950" end="00:31:00.680" style="s2">everybody so so I saw uh you know all</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:00.680" style="s2">these different perspectives all at once</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.980" end="00:31:05.610" style="s2">what I found in in in general and he</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.440" end="00:31:09.960" style="s2">said when it comes to anything having to</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.610" end="00:31:11.940" style="s2">do with politics is that you won&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.960" end="00:31:17.940" style="s2">what the other side is seeing in unless</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.940" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">you&#39;re inside that silo right so if</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.940" end="00:31:23.880" style="s2">there&#39;s some event and it will get</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:25.560" style="s2">amplified in in one silo and you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.880" end="00:31:27.150" style="s2">it go up and then if it gets to bunk&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.560" end="00:31:30.330" style="s2">you&#39;ll only see them in the other silo</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.150" end="00:31:33.320" style="s2">right you know and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.330" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">important to be able to see both sides</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.320" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">so you know it helps balance your your</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:41.640" style="s2">your perspective on things and you start</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:45.180" style="s2">to understand that it&#39;s really not there</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.640" end="00:31:47.100" style="s2">isn&#39;t really as much of a tribal right</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.860" end="00:34:26.320" style="s2">you my my question was about how many</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.050" end="00:34:28.390" style="s2">networks I I&#39;m working in space right</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.320" end="00:34:31.419" style="s2">now where I have to pull in all that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.390" end="00:34:33.730" style="s2">information from different different</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.419" end="00:34:36.830" style="s2">tribes and different networks and try to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.730" end="00:34:41.460" style="s2">make sense of it all and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.830" end="00:34:43.860" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty overwhelmed by the fire</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.460" end="00:34:46.740" style="s2">hose of information so how many networks</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.860" end="00:34:49.110" style="s2">are are you a part of wave how do you</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.740" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">know when you can&#39;t keep tracking them</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:02.820" style="s2">follow the things that I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.270" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">so and that&#39;s usually been my guide</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.820" end="00:35:08.340" style="s2">so if there&#39;s too much information on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">given Network it&#39;s it&#39;s too crowded it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.340" end="00:35:15.480" style="s2">too verbose I may just step out of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:17.880" style="s2">just this isn&#39;t for me I&#39;ll print it if</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.480" end="00:35:20.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a it goes off in tangents things</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.880" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested it I tend to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.820" end="00:35:24.600" style="s2">you know on the networks and join the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.840" style="s2">networks that I they consistently give</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.600" end="00:35:29.580" style="s2">me good information good signal and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.840" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">avoid the ones that have high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.580" end="00:35:36.930" style="s2">noise because that noise can drown out</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:38.430" style="s2">your your thinking so find the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.930" end="00:35:41.820" style="s2">are good and keep those and then add</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.430" end="00:35:43.470" style="s2">very slowly you know try it out if it</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.820" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work if it&#39;s not adding a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.470" end="00:35:52.080" style="s2">signal prune it yeah the mistake would</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">be to try to take all of it in all at</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.080" end="00:35:57.360" style="s2">once you&#39;re joining a bunch at once</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:59.580" style="s2">make a list slowly work through the list</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.360" end="00:36:01.050" style="s2">one of the ones that are good find the</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.580" end="00:36:04.860" style="s2">people on those networks that are good</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.050" end="00:36:06.180" style="s2">and try to tighten those connections we</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.860" end="00:36:08.610" style="s2">had a thing when we were doing that when</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.180" end="00:36:10.890" style="s2">I was doing it reports at Forester as an</p>

<p begin="00:36:19.800" end="00:36:24.390" style="s2">you connect with them and you keep them</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.120" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">in your circle and you do that often</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.490" end="00:37:16.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve been operating drink Ovid with a</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.760" end="00:37:18.650" style="s2">couple different organizations that are</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.280" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">sort of emergent and decentralized and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.650" end="00:37:23.090" style="s2">network mapping has being a really key</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">feature of helping these organizations</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.090" end="00:37:28.310" style="s2">to actually see and understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:30.260" style="s2">going on in the networks I&#39;m finding</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.310" end="00:37:32.150" style="s2">that some people are like really all</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.260" end="00:37:33.530" style="s2">over understanding the networks and some</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.150" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">people are just kind of like well what</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.530" end="00:37:40.010" style="s2">do I do with this I&#39;m really curious</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:42.710" style="s2">about your thoughts on just the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.010" end="00:37:45.170" style="s2">importance of a network to actually look</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.710" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">at itself like to be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.170" end="00:37:52.580" style="s2">self-aware and what role that has to</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:53.930" style="s2">play great you&#39;re talking more looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.580" end="00:37:55.700" style="s2">at it more from an organizational</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.930" end="00:37:58.040" style="s2">framework or perspective where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.700" end="00:38:01.339" style="s2">looking at how your network is operating</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.040" end="00:38:04.280" style="s2">and trying to improve it for time oh wow</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.339" end="00:38:06.770" style="s2">that&#39;s why I remember the there early</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.280" end="00:38:08.540" style="s2">early approaches to this even back in</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.770" end="00:38:10.070" style="s2">the 90s where they were doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.540" end="00:38:12.080" style="s2">like the informal networks in any</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.070" end="00:38:14.300" style="s2">organization and the end the formal</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.080" end="00:38:17.570" style="s2">hierarchies and trying to you know see</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.300" end="00:38:21.830" style="s2">the differences in how to leverage that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.570" end="00:38:24.920" style="s2">informal hierarchy or that formal set of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.830" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">connections to what we&#39;re having what</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.920" end="00:38:33.910" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing today we have the outside</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:33.910" style="s2">inside in terms of self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.250" end="00:38:41.460" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure there are any</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.869" end="00:38:43.050" style="s2">straightforward rules to doing that yet</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.460" end="00:38:44.550" style="s2">but I at least I&#39;ve seen I can I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.050" end="00:38:48.530" style="s2">have him off the top of my head is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.550" end="00:38:48.530" style="s2">been something I&#39;ve been focusing on I</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.980" end="00:38:54.180" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve been focusing more on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.270" end="00:38:56.069" style="s2">macro dynamics in terms of the way I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.180" end="00:38:59.849" style="s2">been approaching my research so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.069" end="00:39:01.619" style="s2">probably don&#39;t have as much you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.849" end="00:39:04.849" style="s2">high-quality thinking to provide you on</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.619" end="00:39:04.849" style="s2">that as I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.040" end="00:39:10.840" style="s2">sorry about the cold no where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.130" end="00:39:12.130" style="s2">thought I&#39;d see ya oh yeah I know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.840" end="00:39:13.150" style="s2">you know if I thought about it for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.130" end="00:39:14.740" style="s2">while maybe I come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.150" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">then I&#39;ll send it to you but I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.740" end="00:39:21.480" style="s2">it rather than just spew on about it</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:21.480" style="s2">brother what</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.299" end="00:39:30.950" style="s2">excellent great Peter I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.450" end="00:39:34.700" style="s2">nervous asking this question maybe like</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.950" end="00:39:39.410" style="s2">15% no queuing on so let me let me think</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.700" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">about how I should phrase this so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.410" end="00:39:43.549" style="s2">McLuhan you know he talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:44.900" style="s2">global village and then you can switch</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.549" end="00:39:47.930" style="s2">that to talk about the global theater</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.900" end="00:39:50.509" style="s2">and that the culture war it feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.930" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">theatrics at times there&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.509" end="00:39:54.519" style="s2">with cue and on there&#39;s like a mythology</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:59.420" style="s2">there&#39;s like this comic-book aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.519" end="00:40:01.970" style="s2">but I&#39;m curious like when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.420" end="00:40:03.410" style="s2">like pair of political or Peter Dale</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.970" end="00:40:05.930" style="s2">Scott calls pair political machinations</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.410" end="00:40:07.640" style="s2">or you know the the criminal overworld</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.930" end="00:40:11.239" style="s2">which the cumin on people are gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.640" end="00:40:13.489" style="s2">towards how do you sense make into that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.239" end="00:40:24.529" style="s2">if there&#39;s so much noise and if there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.489" end="00:40:27.499" style="s2">some signal there alright yeah there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.529" end="00:40:31.880" style="s2">problem with pattern matching right is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.499" end="00:40:34.130" style="s2">that you can get locked into a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.880" end="00:40:36.739" style="s2">that that&#39;s wrong from the get-go and</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.130" end="00:40:39.140" style="s2">you keep you can you can keep on</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.739" end="00:40:43.640" style="s2">matching new information towards to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.140" end="00:40:45.349" style="s2">pattern long past this ex predate and</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.640" end="00:40:47.900" style="s2">long past that when it was when it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.349" end="00:40:54.140" style="s2">actually viable and that can lead to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.900" end="00:40:57.529" style="s2">lot of excess and it can also develop</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.140" end="00:40:59.390" style="s2">this into this kind of us versus em you</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.529" end="00:41:00.950" style="s2">know this is our pattern and these</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.390" end="00:41:04.099" style="s2">people and here&#39;s all the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.950" end="00:41:07.009" style="s2">they&#39;re there persecuting us and why</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.099" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">they&#39;re doing wrong you know extreme</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.009" end="00:41:17.809" style="s2">pattern matching at that at the very at</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:20.410" style="s2">the very extreme end would be is very we</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.809" end="00:41:23.390" style="s2">could lead to violence as we seen with</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.410" end="00:41:27.559" style="s2">in many of the attacks we&#39;ve had over</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.390" end="00:41:29.690" style="s2">the last couple years where people have</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.559" end="00:41:33.650" style="s2">seen all of these reasons why these</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.690" end="00:41:37.160" style="s2">other people are are attacking us I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.650" end="00:41:38.450" style="s2">talk about full village I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.160" end="00:41:41.620" style="s2">you push through that its global</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.450" end="00:41:43.790" style="s2">villagers right global villagers</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.620" end="00:41:47.060" style="s2">extremely interested in everyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.790" end="00:41:52.130" style="s2">problems extremely noisy and</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.060" end="00:41:53.870" style="s2">occasionally extremely bloody minded you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.130" end="00:41:56.840" style="s2">know it&#39;s us you know this is our</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.870" end="00:42:04.700" style="s2">standard and these people are violating</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.840" end="00:42:07.970" style="s2">that standard yeah in terms of figuring</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.700" end="00:42:10.520" style="s2">out what works and what does it is watch</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.970" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">I mean be careful that the the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.520" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">that you&#39;re that you&#39;re working on it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:17.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t become the kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.470" end="00:42:19.100" style="s2">sprawling pattern that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.510" end="00:42:20.660" style="s2">everyone&#39;s force hitting all these</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.100" end="00:42:26.330" style="s2">different sub patterns and it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.660" end="00:42:27.920" style="s2">this quilt of insanity right</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.330" end="00:42:29.830" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s adding to it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.920" end="00:42:32.090" style="s2">everyone&#39;s spending their days you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.830" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">sifting through all of the bits and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.090" end="00:42:35.570" style="s2">pieces of information as it flows</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:38.660" style="s2">through I mean the way weights change</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.570" end="00:42:40.610" style="s2">our thinking is that we don&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.660" end="00:42:43.550" style="s2">something in its entirety a cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.610" end="00:42:44.930" style="s2">thought and then it&#39;s you know spend</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.550" end="00:42:46.970" style="s2">some time thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.930" end="00:42:49.640" style="s2">formulating opinion on it and in</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.970" end="00:42:52.190" style="s2">structuring it we immerse ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.640" end="00:42:54.710" style="s2">the flow and it because the volume of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.190" end="00:42:58.250" style="s2">information is and the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.710" end="00:43:01.160" style="s2">information is so high that we just let</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.250" end="00:43:03.380" style="s2">it flow over us and we fit take out bits</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.160" end="00:43:06.410" style="s2">and pieces that we then match to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.380" end="00:43:09.320" style="s2">pattern right and then we do it with</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.410" end="00:43:12.920" style="s2">other folks and if it&#39;s in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.320" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">crazy patchwork it can get really nutty</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.920" end="00:43:19.640" style="s2">which is you see often some of that in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:21.620" style="s2">the in the queue and on stuff too</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.640" end="00:43:24.830" style="s2">yeah so my follow-up question is like</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.620" end="00:43:26.180" style="s2">Ken Wilber quotes coming to mind you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.830" end="00:43:29.390" style="s2">know no one&#39;s smart enough to be hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.180" end="00:43:31.040" style="s2">percent wrong and so when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.390" end="00:43:33.460" style="s2">these sort of memetic tribes or what</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.040" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">Jordan Hall calls a self organizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.460" end="00:43:39.560" style="s2">collective intelligences it&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.550" end="00:43:41.840" style="s2">do you find the signal there through all</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.560" end="00:43:43.490" style="s2">the noise especially if they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.840" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">about things like the inner machinations</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.490" end="00:43:47.089" style="s2">of the deep state even though maybe like</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.089" end="00:43:54.769" style="s2">crap like how do you find the signal</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.309" end="00:43:56.239" style="s2">there well okay so um any you know large</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.769" end="00:44:01.369" style="s2">scale or comprehensive answer I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.239" end="00:44:05.989" style="s2">pretty skeptical of right I&#39;m I find</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.369" end="00:44:08.239" style="s2">signal mostly in point to set you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.989" end="00:44:10.640" style="s2">it is set over a specific topic or a</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.640" end="00:44:14.509" style="s2">at it in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.869" end="00:44:17.979" style="s2">they present it it&#39;s been hit at or</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.509" end="00:44:21.190" style="s2">pushed back from a righty different</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.210" end="00:44:30.200" style="s2">information then I can trust that if</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.719" end="00:44:32.719" style="s2">somebody has an answer for everything it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.200" end="00:44:36.200" style="s2">is something you have to kind of look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.719" end="00:44:38.180" style="s2">with skepticism the world is you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.200" end="00:44:42.799" style="s2">way too complex for that there isn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.180" end="00:44:46.849" style="s2">one answer any you know comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.799" end="00:44:53.989" style="s2">answer and signal comes in in bits and</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.849" end="00:44:57.170" style="s2">pieces and it&#39;s conditional is it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.989" end="00:45:01.940" style="s2">temporary often it may not be this it</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.170" end="00:45:03.319" style="s2">may not be signal a week from now so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.940" end="00:45:05.719" style="s2">know look at it try to find the bits and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.319" end="00:45:08.599" style="s2">pieces of information or signal at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.719" end="00:45:11.989" style="s2">you know you find finding find useful</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.599" end="00:45:15.140" style="s2">that&#39;s withstood the counter pressure it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.989" end="00:45:20.380" style="s2">makes sense and then go with that that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.140" end="00:45:25.339" style="s2">makes sense it&#39;s a good answer Thanks</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.380" end="00:45:27.469" style="s2">great let&#39;s hear from wrong hey John I</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.339" end="00:45:28.789" style="s2">may have just missed this but when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.469" end="00:45:31.849" style="s2">were talking about the different</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.789" end="00:45:34.489" style="s2">approaches to maintaining cohesion in</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.849" end="00:45:37.489" style="s2">the current crisis I got what she said</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.489" end="00:45:39.589" style="s2">about China Europe Russia etc but I</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.489" end="00:45:42.130" style="s2">think I heard you say you thought the US</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.589" end="00:45:44.410" style="s2">approach was kind of working and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.130" end="00:45:47.469" style="s2">wondered it was there a quickie way you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.410" end="00:45:50.630" style="s2">characterized what with that approaches</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.469" end="00:45:53.029" style="s2">okay well it&#39;s consensus descent it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.630" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">dynamic process okay and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.029" end="00:45:58.249" style="s2">necessarily working on all cylinders now</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:46:00.650" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take a long time to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.249" end="00:46:03.099" style="s2">formalize this and put it in a structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.650" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">actually provides us consistent results</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.099" end="00:46:08.029" style="s2">just like a market just like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:10.520" style="s2">bureaucracy just like tribalism you got</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.029" end="00:46:11.240" style="s2">a package it and you got to scrape off</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.520" end="00:46:12.890" style="s2">all the cruft</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.240" end="00:46:16.940" style="s2">and turn it into something that that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.890" end="00:46:18.619" style="s2">produces higher quality results over the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.940" end="00:46:20.990" style="s2">long term and then what we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.619" end="00:46:23.660" style="s2">with with the network decision making</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.990" end="00:46:26.809" style="s2">right now but I like the dynamism I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.660" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very similar to what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.809" end="00:46:30.619" style="s2">the Cold War is like you had one system</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.599" style="s2">that was there were two systems that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.619" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">were competing and the one that was more</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.599" end="00:46:38.809" style="s2">dynamic was more innovative over time a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:42.579" style="s2">lot more diversity of views and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.809" end="00:46:45.529" style="s2">development and it innovated the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.579" end="00:46:47.599" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s going to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.529" end="00:46:50.029" style="s2">here&#39;s is the one that&#39;s right on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.599" end="00:46:55.369" style="s2">edge of chaos and he can keep a society</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.029" end="00:46:58.369" style="s2">cohesive while riding that edge while</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.369" end="00:47:03.410" style="s2">we&#39;re riding that you know that bleeding</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.369" end="00:47:08.359" style="s2">edge of potential so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.410" end="00:47:11.450" style="s2">consensus really emerged and was very</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.359" end="00:47:17.390" style="s2">effective at it early in early response</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.450" end="00:47:20.119" style="s2">to code to the pandemic sifted through</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.390" end="00:47:22.210" style="s2">the information and people found it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.119" end="00:47:24.920" style="s2">I mean I wrote my January report</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.210" end="00:47:26.809" style="s2">entitled it pandemic right so I was like</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.920" end="00:47:32.049" style="s2">one of those pieces of information that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.809" end="00:47:35.720" style="s2">was contributing and people formulated</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.049" end="00:47:37.490" style="s2">ideas as to how to respond to it social</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.720" end="00:47:39.829" style="s2">distancing floated to the top and people</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.490" end="00:47:41.539" style="s2">implemented and people asked companies</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.829" end="00:47:45.380" style="s2">to work you know that they would set up</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.539" end="00:47:47.089" style="s2">work back home and start restricting and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.380" end="00:47:49.700" style="s2">they started changing their demand</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.089" end="00:47:52.010" style="s2">behavior and you know airline traffic</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.700" end="00:47:53.450" style="s2">started dropping number of passengers</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.010" end="00:47:55.069" style="s2">buh buh buh buh buh buh and even now we</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.450" end="00:47:56.839" style="s2">don&#39;t have you know formal restrictions</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.069" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">or governor searches on flying</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.839" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s ninety-six percent below what</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:06.289" style="s2">it was a year ago so um that was</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:08.210" style="s2">effective it made decision earlier than</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.289" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">the formal bureaucratic decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.210" end="00:48:13.150" style="s2">systems did in the US and in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.970" end="00:48:20.090" style="s2">there was also a dynamic response to</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.800" end="00:48:21.470" style="s2">testing I mean the bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.090" end="00:48:23.870" style="s2">decision-making system that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.470" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">planning for pandemics forever but we</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.870" end="00:48:30.020" style="s2">expected them to go slower we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:31.310" style="s2">expect it you know to move as quickly as</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.020" end="00:48:36.340" style="s2">they did in this to this complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.310" end="00:48:38.570" style="s2">environment so the FDA gave the CDC sole</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.340" end="00:48:41.900" style="s2">or monopoly control over the production</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.570" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">of a test in order to emphasize quality</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.900" end="00:48:47.300" style="s2">over quantity and they were more worried</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:49.370" style="s2">about the downside effects of the lower</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.300" end="00:48:53.810" style="s2">quality test and so that they gave that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.370" end="00:48:56.000" style="s2">monopoly I to the CDC the CDC obviously</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.810" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">flubbed it so by the end of February we</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.000" end="00:49:01.130" style="s2">figured out that they did flub it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:04.220" style="s2">then they&#39;d opened it up they said okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.130" end="00:49:07.340" style="s2">well anyone any public lab or public</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.220" end="00:49:10.130" style="s2">health lab that has certification and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.340" end="00:49:11.540" style="s2">complex testing go ahead have at it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.130" end="00:49:18.350" style="s2">then all of a sudden the tests went from</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.540" end="00:49:20.330" style="s2">300 tests a day in March first to three</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.350" end="00:49:23.750" style="s2">weeks later we&#39;re pressing through 60 or</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.330" end="00:49:26.360" style="s2">70,000 so it&#39;s like amazing the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.750" end="00:49:31.450" style="s2">all hands kind of network response that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.360" end="00:49:35.860" style="s2">can happen you know if if it&#39;s properly</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.450" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">kind of put to use</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.860" end="00:49:41.510" style="s2">you know the bureaucratic response it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:43.220" style="s2">been really slow and cumbersome I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.510" end="00:49:46.520" style="s2">know if any country actually has gotten</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.220" end="00:49:48.500" style="s2">it right you know some have reduced this</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.520" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">but they&#39;ve destroyed their economy in</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.500" end="00:49:53.030" style="s2">the process some are increasing deaths</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:56.420" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re keeping their economy</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.030" end="00:50:01.700" style="s2">bubbling along they&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.420" end="00:50:03.500" style="s2">effective the ones that probably are the</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.700" end="00:50:05.240" style="s2">most of did the best were the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.500" end="00:50:09.550" style="s2">closed off the borders early like Taiwan</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.240" end="00:50:12.890" style="s2">and Greece and Japan I mean they</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.550" end="00:50:14.600" style="s2">externalize the quarantine because they</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.890" end="00:50:16.220" style="s2">knew that there were so many different</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.600" end="00:50:17.560" style="s2">ways in which they could travel and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.220" end="00:50:21.190" style="s2">could travel very very quickly they</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.560" end="00:50:21.190" style="s2">stumbled into the right approach</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.180" end="00:50:29.110" style="s2">so uh yeah we&#39;re gonna get better at</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.390" end="00:50:31.480" style="s2">using networks and and and and network</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.110" end="00:50:33.250" style="s2">responses you know one thing that really</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.480" end="00:50:34.840" style="s2">struck me is when you you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.250" end="00:50:37.390" style="s2">epidemiological models and you talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.840" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">listen to how they talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:42.670" style="s2">assumptions what goes into those is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:45.300" style="s2">none of them expected any more than say</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.670" end="00:50:48.940" style="s2">10 percent or 15 percent of voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.300" end="00:50:51.220" style="s2">support for social distance it was it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.940" end="00:50:53.620" style="s2">like when you get 60 to 70 percent and</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.220" end="00:50:56.980" style="s2">it&#39;s all voluntary that was just blew</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.620" end="00:50:58.390" style="s2">their minds it wasn&#39;t possible and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.980" end="00:51:01.270" style="s2">they you know that kind of thing is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.390" end="00:51:03.640" style="s2">happening on its own is like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.270" end="00:51:05.830" style="s2">something that they had baked in so we</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.640" end="00:51:08.440" style="s2">have a new system of getting things done</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.830" end="00:51:10.270" style="s2">that if we could really get our arms</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.440" end="00:51:13.930" style="s2">around it and make it effective we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.270" end="00:51:15.070" style="s2">get things done really really quickly of</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.930" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">course it to the downside of that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.070" end="00:51:20.860" style="s2">that it if it can lock yourself in and</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:24.310" style="s2">and get things done it&#39;s hard to turn it</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.860" end="00:51:26.050" style="s2">off once you get it going so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.310" end="00:51:29.500" style="s2">the decision can&#39;t you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.050" end="00:51:30.850" style="s2">want to start to shut down that dissent</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.500" end="00:51:32.980" style="s2">function through through internet</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.850" end="00:51:35.260" style="s2">censorship and lockdowns and anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.980" end="00:51:38.230" style="s2">says anything that&#39;s like a little</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.260" end="00:51:39.820" style="s2">outside the norm you know you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.230" end="00:51:42.130" style="s2">to block those folks out because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.820" end="00:51:44.170" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re wiping out potential</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.130" end="00:51:46.270" style="s2">signal wiping out potential innovation</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.170" end="00:51:48.340" style="s2">wiping out a reason why you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.270" end="00:51:51.430" style="s2">that consensus to lock in as as tightly</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.340" end="00:51:55.570" style="s2">as it has it&#39;s better to keep it there</p>

<p begin="00:51:55.570" end="00:52:00.430" style="s2">to have it there than not so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.810" end="00:52:03.340" style="s2">learning these lessons I mean look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.430" end="00:52:05.650" style="s2">tough it&#39;s it&#39;s dislocating it feels</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.340" end="00:52:07.420" style="s2">horrible at times watching what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.650" end="00:52:09.640" style="s2">on and listening to the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.420" end="00:52:12.640" style="s2">but you know we&#39;re learning how to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.640" end="00:52:15.039" style="s2">this and the rest of the world isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">and if we can figure this out if we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.039" end="00:52:19.510" style="s2">figure out how to package this consensus</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:21.309" style="s2">into set and network decision-making and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.510" end="00:52:25.089" style="s2">learn how to utilize it and learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.309" end="00:52:28.089" style="s2">leverage it and make it work for us it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.089" end="00:52:31.779" style="s2">a gift for everybody it&#39;s like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.089" end="00:52:34.059" style="s2">way out of this kind of mess but on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.779" end="00:52:35.619" style="s2">other you know if we don&#39;t it&#39;s a you</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.059" end="00:52:38.130" style="s2">know will rip ourselves apart and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.619" end="00:52:40.329" style="s2">Makluan think didn&#39;t think that we could</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.130" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">figure this out until we actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.329" end="00:52:45.609" style="s2">created a technological artifact a</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.930" style="s2">social technological artifact you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.609" end="00:52:51.190" style="s2">we figured out the technology that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.930" end="00:52:54.039" style="s2">actually helped us move this and I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.190" end="00:52:57.220" style="s2">a eye on the subject what the social</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.039" end="00:52:59.920" style="s2">networks are are capable of doing with</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.220" end="00:53:03.130" style="s2">AI support make this easier over time</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.920" end="00:53:04.809" style="s2">once we figure out how to do it right</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.130" end="00:53:10.960" style="s2">now it&#39;s mostly focused on censorship</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.809" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">and add promotion but those ideas may be</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.960" end="00:53:16.799" style="s2">critical to our future to getting the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:20.799" style="s2">turning this into a high-performance</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.799" end="00:53:22.599" style="s2">decision-making system and you know kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.799" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">of taking a little bit of the Croft off</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.599" end="00:53:30.509" style="s2">a little bit of the more dangerous stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:33.460" style="s2">out without damaging his performance um</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.509" end="00:53:35.259" style="s2">you know maybe I&#39;m how do you put it</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.460" end="00:53:37.869" style="s2">maybe if I use this metaphor it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.259" end="00:53:39.400" style="s2">okay my background at least did when I</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.869" end="00:53:42.490" style="s2">was an astronaut a plunger and was</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.400" end="00:53:44.650" style="s2">thinking about okay control systems that</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.490" end="00:53:47.019" style="s2">was my subspecialty so I think in terms</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.650" end="00:53:50.140" style="s2">of control systems dealing with complex</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.019" end="00:53:51.970" style="s2">environments and if you want like for</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.140" end="00:53:55.869" style="s2">instance an aircraft to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.970" end="00:53:59.380" style="s2">high-performance you add instability</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.869" end="00:54:02.890" style="s2">into the design right you make it</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.380" end="00:54:05.019" style="s2">unstable and you use a control system to</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.890" end="00:54:07.480" style="s2">compensate for that so if you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.019" end="00:54:09.640" style="s2">be able to turn faster and and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.480" end="00:54:10.900" style="s2">perform better you have instability that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.640" end="00:54:13.000" style="s2">you build into it and you build a better</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.900" end="00:54:15.009" style="s2">control system to handle that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.000" end="00:54:17.589" style="s2">instability we&#39;re facing instability</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.009" end="00:54:20.829" style="s2">both in the environment that we&#39;re in as</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.589" end="00:54:22.269" style="s2">well as internally because we see our</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.829" end="00:54:24.280" style="s2">politics and the way we make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.269" end="00:54:26.800" style="s2">internally has been changed</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.280" end="00:54:30.100" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got instability into the into</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.800" end="00:54:32.620" style="s2">the aircraft as well as the external</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.100" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">environment and now we have to build a</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.620" end="00:54:38.440" style="s2">control system necessary to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:41.200" style="s2">allow us to navigate successfully or to</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.440" end="00:54:43.270" style="s2">to do things now we can lock it down</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.200" end="00:54:46.450" style="s2">where the you know single pilot making</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.270" end="00:54:47.830" style="s2">all the decisions like China&#39;s doing in</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.450" end="00:54:51.760" style="s2">Russia to a certain extent in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.830" end="00:54:53.050" style="s2">different way is doing or we can make</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.760" end="00:54:57.010" style="s2">the plane smarter</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.050" end="00:54:59.620" style="s2">make the overall system smarter so we</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.010" end="00:55:03.940" style="s2">can respond to the external environment</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.620" end="00:55:06.760" style="s2">quicker and it can make better decisions</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.940" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">overall and I think that&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.760" end="00:55:11.230" style="s2">consensus descent is starting us in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:16.660" style="s2">direction or we&#39;re starting in that</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.230" end="00:55:18.580" style="s2">direction yeah if you if you once you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.660" end="00:55:22.060" style="s2">start seeing things in this consensus</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.580" end="00:55:23.680" style="s2">descent framework it it can relax you a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.060" end="00:55:28.050" style="s2">little bit because you don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.680" end="00:55:30.520" style="s2">see it as this us versus them anymore or</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.050" end="00:55:34.830" style="s2">that this that were you know going off</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.520" end="00:55:34.830" style="s2">in it in the totally wrong direction</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:39.640" style="s2">yeah so I mean as I answer your question</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.510" end="00:55:43.050" style="s2">they get you get it towards where you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.640" end="00:55:46.180" style="s2">wonder you yeah absolutely thank you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.050" end="00:55:47.650" style="s2">Thanks and then Keith raised his hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.180" end="00:55:49.600" style="s2">because he had something specific he</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.650" end="00:55:51.100" style="s2">wanted to respond to from what you were</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.600" end="00:55:52.330" style="s2">saying so Keith if you want to bring</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.100" end="00:55:55.950" style="s2">that in and then maybe if we have time</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.330" end="00:55:55.950" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to Rose&#39;s question after that</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.790" end="00:56:06.550" style="s2">yeah yeah so I wanted to ask a question</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.940" end="00:56:08.560" style="s2">about alternative networks and which</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.550" end="00:56:13.900" style="s2">sorts of networks are the highest signal</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.560" end="00:56:16.780" style="s2">that we can be relating with and I found</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.900" end="00:56:19.900" style="s2">a number of networks like and recently</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.780" end="00:56:22.180" style="s2">since coated interesting a lot of it has</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.900" end="00:56:24.190" style="s2">come out of Taiwan I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.180" end="00:56:26.770" style="s2">inspired by the V Taiwan system and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.190" end="00:56:30.550" style="s2">g0v networks that are going on out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.770" end="00:56:32.410" style="s2">that they have had such an effective</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.550" end="00:56:36.210" style="s2">pandemic response with in instituting</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.410" end="00:56:38.230" style="s2">contact tracing resource supply networks</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.210" end="00:56:42.070" style="s2">all in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.230" end="00:56:44.980" style="s2">decentralized fashion but locally out</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.070" end="00:56:47.710" style="s2">here in and I&#39;ve been doing some</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.980" end="00:56:49.060" style="s2">research trying to map out where some of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.710" end="00:56:51.369" style="s2">these things are happening all over the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.060" end="00:56:52.840" style="s2">world and some of the network questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.369" end="00:56:55.270" style="s2">that I have or how to connect up</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.840" end="00:56:56.530" style="s2">different networks that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.270" end="00:56:58.000" style="s2">where people are having these</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.530" end="00:56:59.710" style="s2">innovations that you don&#39;t see because</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.000" end="00:57:03.070" style="s2">you&#39;re not speaking the same language</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.710" end="00:57:04.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re not in the same network so</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.070" end="00:57:08.890" style="s2">how do you bridge the gap between</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.960" end="00:57:11.560" style="s2">networks but also it seems to me that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.890" end="00:57:13.180" style="s2">need to be there&#39;s so much like with</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.560" end="00:57:16.780" style="s2">Tristan Harris&#39;s work there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.180" end="00:57:19.000" style="s2">many issues coming in with you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.780" end="00:57:22.780" style="s2">extreme algorithmic filters and filter</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.000" end="00:57:23.980" style="s2">bubbles and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s mostly par</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.780" end="00:57:26.260" style="s2">for the course most people understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.980" end="00:57:28.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about there but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.260" end="00:57:31.810" style="s2">extreme filtering of information towards</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.980" end="00:57:35.890" style="s2">sensationalism and moral outrage right</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.810" end="00:57:39.100" style="s2">and so it seems to me that that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.890" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">an inherent outgrowth of the ad model</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.100" end="00:57:44.920" style="s2">and so that if you want to not be</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">subject to those types of filters and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.920" end="00:57:57.400" style="s2">different you can go towards new</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:58:01.270" style="s2">networks like shtetl but I think has</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.400" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">like some peer-to-peer that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.270" end="00:58:08.619" style="s2">server is decentralized and so the it</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:10.750" style="s2">seems to me I&#39;m wondering what networks</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.619" end="00:58:12.820" style="s2">you found to be like what alternative</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.750" end="00:58:18.040" style="s2">networks you found that are most</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.820" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">effective at failure cases of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.040" end="00:58:22.810" style="s2">networks that are most popular today and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:24.390" style="s2">how we can engage with those networks</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.810" end="00:58:27.400" style="s2">and how we can bridge the gap between</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.390" end="00:58:29.560" style="s2">networks that are growing globally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.400" end="00:58:31.570" style="s2">well I spend most my time on the big</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.560" end="00:58:35.640" style="s2">networks you know I&#39;ve been on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.570" end="00:58:37.450" style="s2">since what 2007 and and Facebook and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.640" end="00:58:40.000" style="s2">through my own blog</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.450" end="00:58:41.770" style="s2">most of my stuff now is back Jim so the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.000" end="00:58:44.350" style="s2">people I&#39;ve collected over the years so</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.770" end="00:58:46.060" style="s2">I have you know large chat groups that</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.350" end="00:58:48.490" style="s2">I&#39;m running in the background and their</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.060" end="00:58:51.160" style="s2">sound folks and I appreciate their input</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.490" end="00:58:52.210" style="s2">and they appreciate mine and we keep</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.160" end="00:58:56.730" style="s2">ourselves grounded</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.210" end="00:58:59.589" style="s2">way you know what I do when I look at</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.730" end="00:59:01.300" style="s2">new networks is more I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.589" end="00:59:02.560" style="s2">technology so I used to be a tech</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.300" end="00:59:04.300" style="s2">analyst oh look at those stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.560" end="00:59:05.770" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s good about how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.300" end="00:59:07.990" style="s2">actually sifting and sorting it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.770" end="00:59:09.790" style="s2">because I don&#39;t necessarily find the</p>
