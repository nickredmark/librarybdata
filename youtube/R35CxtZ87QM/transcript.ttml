<p begin="00:07:15.630" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">philosophy of stoicism and that</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.430" end="00:07:25.479" style="s2">readiness to the breath that could be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:27.880" style="s2">very powerful thing yeah breath also</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.479" end="00:07:29.380" style="s2">anchors us to our consciousness as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.880" end="00:07:33.160" style="s2">as the first conscious thing we do as</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.380" end="00:07:35.110" style="s2">the last conscious thing mmm life and so</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.110" end="00:07:39.400" style="s2">Stuart thought with our breath and with</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.210" end="00:07:44.169" style="s2">our consciousness will always have it</p>

<p begin="00:10:30.190" end="00:10:35.050" style="s2">brain works its way you pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:36.460" style="s2">things and the more you practice it</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.050" end="00:10:39.730" style="s2">through breath work the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.460" end="00:10:41.380" style="s2">more you become aware of your breath</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.730" end="00:10:44.740" style="s2">and because you&#39;re anchoring that breath</p>

<p begin="00:12:11.110" end="00:12:17.350" style="s2">history of how you got into the breath</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.790" end="00:12:19.000" style="s2">work and how it connects to stoicism so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.350" end="00:12:21.250" style="s2">maybe I&#39;ll just add a little context</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.000" end="00:12:23.800" style="s2">about how you and I met and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.250" end="00:12:25.570" style="s2">we can kind of launch into your origin</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.800" end="00:12:30.280" style="s2">story maybe and then how we got to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.570" end="00:12:34.440" style="s2">stoic breath so I I run the stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.280" end="00:12:37.570" style="s2">Toronto group here in Toronto and I got</p>

<p begin="00:12:52.779" end="00:12:59.049" style="s2">in Toronto who does this to invite them</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.209" end="00:13:00.369" style="s2">in to the talk because intuitively I</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.049" end="00:13:02.049" style="s2">felt there was a connection between wim</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.369" end="00:13:03.399" style="s2">HOF and stoicism even though I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.049" end="00:13:07.089" style="s2">know if he makes that connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.399" end="00:13:09.189" style="s2">directly yeah and the connection there</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.089" end="00:13:11.709" style="s2">was the cold shower stuff because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.189" end="00:13:15.730" style="s2">been taking cold showers for awhile</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.709" end="00:13:17.499" style="s2">without even thinkin knew about the wim</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.730" end="00:13:18.879" style="s2">HOF method I&#39;m not sure about that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.499" end="00:13:22.420" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t inspired by the wim HOF method</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.879" end="00:13:24.519" style="s2">my cold shower taking and Stoics talking</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.420" end="00:13:26.319" style="s2">about voluntary hardship like just kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.519" end="00:13:27.670" style="s2">of like put yourself in situations where</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.319" end="00:13:29.019" style="s2">you sleep on the floor or you under</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.670" end="00:13:30.809" style="s2">dressed for the weather or you know take</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.019" end="00:13:33.970" style="s2">cold showers just to build that muscle</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.809" end="00:13:36.699" style="s2">you know so you could enter the arena</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.970" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">and so I&#39;ve been taking cold showers for</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.699" end="00:13:40.360" style="s2">a while and then that&#39;s how I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:43.239" style="s2">got the connection seeing wim HOF and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.360" end="00:13:45.879" style="s2">then stoicism bite is you in you had</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.649" end="00:14:32.069" style="s2">you got into breath work and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.749" end="00:14:32.069" style="s2">how it relates to stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.280" end="00:14:37.890" style="s2">yeah I Alden I always considered myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.640" end="00:14:41.580" style="s2">to be a stoic because I didn&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.890" end="00:14:44.340" style="s2">a stoic was I thought stoicism was just</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.580" end="00:14:47.550" style="s2">don&#39;t have emotions shove those down and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.340" end="00:14:48.840" style="s2">to be stoic but I realized after I met</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.110" end="00:16:07.260" style="s2">probably all through my 20s I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.760" end="00:16:09.089" style="s2">really aware of it but as I got into my</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:25.650" style="s2">session I did it took me longer and long</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.490" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">to recover my body was breaking down my</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.650" end="00:16:28.920" style="s2">digestive system was failing me I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:30.780" style="s2">couldn&#39;t speak properly I&#39;ve aches and</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.780" end="00:16:35.580" style="s2">and my doctor said you know you&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:16:37.530" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">surely not so I changed the way I was</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.110" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">exercising training the way changed the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.850" end="00:16:45.060" style="s2">way I was eating and sleeping and</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.060" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">but then I got worse and sicker and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.330" end="00:16:55.620" style="s2">sicker and sicker and I didn&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:58.500" style="s2">and I was a personal trainer at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.620" end="00:17:02.280" style="s2">time so I was doing all the right stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.500" end="00:17:04.140" style="s2">but I was still getting sick and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.280" end="00:17:05.970" style="s2">nicked nothing worse and then one day in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.140" end="00:17:06.630" style="s2">my early 40s I found myself lying in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.970" end="00:17:10.590" style="s2">hospital bed</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.630" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">you know Sinai Hospital in Toronto very</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.590" end="00:17:15.720" style="s2">sick my body was in agony I could barely</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:17.460" style="s2">move all my joints were inflamed in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.720" end="00:17:19.080" style="s2">heart it was an atrial fibrillation it</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.460" end="00:17:22.200" style="s2">was bouncing around in my chest I</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.080" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">couldn&#39;t catch my breath and the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.200" end="00:17:25.470" style="s2">were getting ready to shock me back into</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:27.030" style="s2">sinus rhythm and she brought the crash</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.470" end="00:17:29.490" style="s2">cart into the hospital room and I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.030" end="00:17:30.810" style="s2">looking at holy Travon like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.490" end="00:17:34.860" style="s2">right this isn&#39;t supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.810" end="00:17:36.810" style="s2">happening to me and there&#39;s right at</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.860" end="00:17:40.230" style="s2">that moment that all these alarms went</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.810" end="00:17:41.610" style="s2">off in the emergency room the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.230" end="00:17:43.830" style="s2">and nurses running back and forth they</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.610" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">were wheeling it all these people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.830" end="00:17:47.700" style="s2">just been in a bar fight and this like</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:50.910" style="s2">all sorts of lacerations and arterial</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.700" end="00:17:52.620" style="s2">bleeds everywhere and and so I was put</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.910" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">on hold I was stable enough then I was</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.620" end="00:17:59.910" style="s2">lying this hospital bed and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">said it loud I&#39;m not sick and it was at</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.910" end="00:18:06.270" style="s2">that moment where I said I&#39;m not sick</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">that my heart was clicked back into</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.270" end="00:18:13.470" style="s2">sinus rhythm and I was fine I caught my</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">breath and I felt better and the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.470" end="00:18:16.920" style="s2">came and checked me out and I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:18.120" style="s2">discharged from the hospital when I went</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.920" end="00:18:19.620" style="s2">through this round after round after</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.120" end="00:18:22.680" style="s2">round of testing to see what was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.620" end="00:18:24.780" style="s2">with me and they finally found out I had</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.680" end="00:18:27.720" style="s2">some sort of a runaway inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.780" end="00:18:31.860" style="s2">disorder that they call nonspecific</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.720" end="00:18:34.590" style="s2">rheumatoid arthritis which is not a</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.860" end="00:18:36.390" style="s2">thing but they had medication to control</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.590" end="00:18:37.660" style="s2">the inflammation my body they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.390" end="00:18:41.410" style="s2">know what was causing</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.660" end="00:18:42.940" style="s2">here house and medication and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.410" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">good enough for me that that wasn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.940" end="00:18:46.270" style="s2">answer I wanted didn&#39;t want to identify</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:47.530" style="s2">with just being a sick person that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.270" end="00:18:49.990" style="s2">here&#39;s your pills and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.530" end="00:18:52.900" style="s2">rest of your life and so I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.990" end="00:18:54.550" style="s2">for another way forward and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.900" end="00:18:56.950" style="s2">a friend of mine introduced me to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:18:59.320" style="s2">wim HOF method and I looked at it I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.950" end="00:19:01.450" style="s2">seen wim HOF years ago I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.320" end="00:19:03.700" style="s2">documentary but this crazy guy who ran a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:06.070" style="s2">marathon in the Arctic but just shorts</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.700" end="00:19:07.630" style="s2">on he was barefoot bare chested they may</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.070" end="00:19:09.580" style="s2">have had a half mil for the two company</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.630" end="00:19:11.800" style="s2">you had just shorts barefoot ran a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.580" end="00:19:13.420" style="s2">marathon that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty deep I</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.800" end="00:19:15.010" style="s2">like the cold too you know I go to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.420" end="00:19:20.650" style="s2">winter camp thing I like the cold feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.010" end="00:19:22.570" style="s2">good and so I watch more documentaries</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.650" end="00:19:25.260" style="s2">and I downloaded the app and finally</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:28.930" style="s2">after weeks of just looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.260" end="00:19:32.920" style="s2">feeling sick i sat down and did the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.930" end="00:19:39.370" style="s2">breath work took a big breath in let it</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.920" end="00:19:42.820" style="s2">go took 30 of those and then held my</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.370" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">breath with no air in my lungs for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.820" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">long time did two more rounds like that</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:49.900" style="s2">at the end of those first three rounds</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:52.030" style="s2">with wim HOF breathing that I did I felt</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.900" end="00:19:54.040" style="s2">better the stiffness I had in my body</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.030" end="00:19:56.860" style="s2">the achy myths that I just become</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.040" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">accustomed to was gone I felt this</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.860" end="00:20:02.170" style="s2">freedom in my body oh wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:05.710" style="s2">amazing so I got deeper into it started</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.170" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">this daily practice of rounds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.710" end="00:20:09.940" style="s2">breathing in a cold shower rounds are</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:11.950" style="s2">breathing in a cold shower day after day</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.940" end="00:20:13.390" style="s2">after day a certain feeling better and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.950" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">better and better</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.390" end="00:20:18.670" style="s2">downloaded an online program the 10-week</p>

<p begin="00:22:50.890" end="00:23:01.570" style="s2">just how it was a very deep experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.920" end="00:23:04.210" style="s2">for me and I was feeling just just with</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.570" end="00:23:05.680" style="s2">me uneasy out of my body like I felt</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.210" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">like I&#39;d left my body and it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.680" end="00:23:10.930" style="s2">quite in it and then I went into the ice</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.930" end="00:23:15.100" style="s2">have an ice bath</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.060" end="00:23:19.150" style="s2">there&#39;s no escaping the ice water there</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.100" end="00:23:22.300" style="s2">is a rush of stress and fear and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.150" end="00:23:26.020" style="s2">it just rushing up through your body and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.300" end="00:23:27.820" style="s2">you have to breathe through it and face</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.020" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">that sphere and the stress and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.820" end="00:23:33.520" style="s2">in your belly up and you relax and then</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:41.320" style="s2">and then right at the end of that I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:45.060" style="s2">found my blockage it was right there in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.320" end="00:23:48.010" style="s2">front of me and I can only liken it to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.060" end="00:23:49.870" style="s2">like I saw my brain as a Rubik&#39;s Cube</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.010" end="00:23:52.510" style="s2">and suddenly I went click</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.870" end="00:23:54.760" style="s2">and all the colors lined up and I saw me</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.510" end="00:23:57.130" style="s2">and I saw my life and I saw my future in</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.760" end="00:23:59.680" style="s2">my past I saw everything and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.130" end="00:24:03.580" style="s2">blockage inside of me was this blockage</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.680" end="00:24:08.650" style="s2">of emotion that burst out of me in this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.580" end="00:24:11.530" style="s2">massive waves of the spa the sobbing and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.650" end="00:24:13.300" style="s2">crying and laughing hysterically and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.530" end="00:24:16.770" style="s2">laid in this tub of ice water we lost</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.300" end="00:24:19.900" style="s2">for 10 minutes laughing and crying as</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.770" end="00:24:22.420" style="s2">years of emotions that I denied myself</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.900" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">came just pouring out of me and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.420" end="00:24:26.680" style="s2">couldn&#39;t stop but there was no stopping</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:30.190" style="s2">it&#39;s just bubbling out I realized</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.680" end="00:24:35.260" style="s2">afterwards that I that was the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.190" end="00:24:37.090" style="s2">time I cried in 32 years true that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.260" end="00:24:40.090" style="s2">deaths of grandparents and aunts and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.090" end="00:24:42.910" style="s2">uncles and deaths hats hard times is my</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.090" end="00:24:45.960" style="s2">life rakes up breakups girlfriends and</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.910" end="00:24:48.400" style="s2">all kinds of just nothing no emotion</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.960" end="00:24:49.890" style="s2">because I was still like I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.400" end="00:24:52.260" style="s2">emotions</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.890" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">so it was that was almost three years</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.260" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">ago that happened so it&#39;s been an</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.920" style="s2">incredible journey where I&#39;ve become a</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">real stoic now we&#39;re now actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.920" end="00:25:06.360" style="s2">observe how I feel then you have to feel</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:08.280" style="s2">to be able to understand you feel your</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.360" end="00:25:10.950" style="s2">feelings you have to be able to feel and</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.280" end="00:25:12.450" style="s2">to recognize what those are why you have</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.950" end="00:25:14.670" style="s2">those and you understand what a primary</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.450" end="00:25:16.980" style="s2">emotion is and what a secondary emotions</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.670" end="00:25:19.590" style="s2">and a lot of the time</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.980" end="00:25:21.570" style="s2">where does complicated monkeys things</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.590" end="00:25:24.210" style="s2">happen to us that make us suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.570" end="00:25:26.820" style="s2">stressful or angry or joyous or full of</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.210" end="00:25:29.669" style="s2">love and it was quick and it&#39;s a primary</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.820" end="00:25:32.790" style="s2">reaction 2000c primary emotion and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.669" end="00:25:36.210" style="s2">our monkey brains fill on the rest with</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.790" end="00:25:39.780" style="s2">secondary emotions that we do well on we</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.210" end="00:25:44.669" style="s2">linger in this stress and this anger and</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.780" end="00:25:47.309" style="s2">it&#39;s made up emotion that we have so</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.669" end="00:25:50.970" style="s2">when we stop then we go into our brass</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.309" end="00:25:54.210" style="s2">and we observe what I&#39;m truly feeling</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.970" end="00:25:58.169" style="s2">right now what this event around me is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.210" end="00:26:01.140" style="s2">making me feel recognized and I allow</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.169" end="00:26:04.620" style="s2">myself to feel it then I can can become</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.140" end="00:26:08.960" style="s2">complete become a whole person and to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.620" end="00:26:11.610" style="s2">function in this world so that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.960" end="00:26:17.400" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my back straight how how</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.610" end="00:26:20.309" style="s2">I got you now how I function yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.400" end="00:26:22.860" style="s2">came up there is um you know how you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.309" end="00:26:28.260" style="s2">looted to it earlier the the lowercase</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.860" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">stoic versus the uppercase stoic and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.260" end="00:26:32.730" style="s2">the lowercase though is that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:34.500" style="s2">stereotypical kind of mostly man who</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.730" end="00:26:36.030" style="s2">just sort of represses his emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.500" end="00:26:38.460" style="s2">can kind of tough through things tough</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.030" end="00:26:40.980" style="s2">mudder through things where the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.460" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">uppercase stoic is is the rich</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.980" end="00:26:46.200" style="s2">philosophy and I would argue I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:53.370" style="s2">gonna argue it now but I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.200" end="00:26:54.750" style="s2">that if you are upper case stoic you</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.370" end="00:26:58.190" style="s2">have the capacity to be a lowercase</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.750" end="00:26:58.190" style="s2">stoic but not vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.610" end="00:27:01.950" style="s2">because sometimes you need to just sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.570" end="00:27:03.059" style="s2">of like have that distance from your</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.950" end="00:27:04.470" style="s2">emotion and just</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.059" end="00:27:08.549" style="s2">yourself and prudence and just do what</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.470" end="00:27:10.769" style="s2">you have to do but like you said I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.549" end="00:27:13.409" style="s2">a good true stoicism and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.769" end="00:27:15.749" style="s2">feel like the the wider stoic movement</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.409" end="00:27:18.179" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have which is I&#39;m seeking for or</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.749" end="00:27:21.330" style="s2">which what I think stoicism is asking of</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.179" end="00:27:24.509" style="s2">me right now and of us right now is -</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.330" end="00:27:26.759" style="s2">yes have that cognitive diffusion the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.509" end="00:27:28.289" style="s2">capacity it is to kind of like make sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.759" end="00:27:30.269" style="s2">your emotions and your thoughts are not</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.289" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2">a mesh together so if you hear something</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.269" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">that you don&#39;t just get triggered and</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:35.730" style="s2">you run off so have that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:37.980" style="s2">diffuse which I do think the breathing</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.730" end="00:27:41.029" style="s2">does but then kind of start building a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.980" end="00:27:43.470" style="s2">relationship with the rich emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.029" end="00:27:45.629" style="s2">realities that we all have and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.470" end="00:27:47.610" style="s2">view them as enemies give them a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.629" end="00:27:50.369" style="s2">like friends that sometimes give you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.610" end="00:27:53.999" style="s2">wrong advice but have that healthy</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.369" end="00:27:56.580" style="s2">relationship with them yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.999" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">like so we can&#39;t just have something bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.580" end="00:28:01.590" style="s2">happens we can&#39;t just react to that and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:05.190" style="s2">burst out into a fit of anger or sorrow</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.590" end="00:28:06.840" style="s2">we have to function Society but when we</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.190" end="00:28:09.480" style="s2">feel like coming away when we&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.840" end="00:28:11.249" style="s2">with that that anger that sorrow that</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.480" end="00:28:12.600" style="s2">grief that joy whatever it is and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.249" end="00:28:15.350" style="s2">not an appropriate time to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.600" end="00:28:17.429" style="s2">it&#39;s that is using that breath to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.350" end="00:28:20.879" style="s2">breathe and drop into the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.429" end="00:28:24.629" style="s2">then recognize what it is and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.879" end="00:28:26.940" style="s2">that okay I feel this set of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.629" end="00:28:28.590" style="s2">due to my circumstances I&#39;m gonna finish</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.940" end="00:28:30.869" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing right now to get through</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.590" end="00:28:32.970" style="s2">it and then deal with that so I have</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.869" end="00:28:35.450" style="s2">tools to deal with those emotions which</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.970" end="00:28:38.460" style="s2">allows us now to have that that rich</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.450" end="00:28:40.320" style="s2">experience and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.460" end="00:28:45.269" style="s2">dealing with in our breath classes right</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.320" end="00:28:48.269" style="s2">now our daily breath class is we learn</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.269" end="00:28:49.559" style="s2">to go back into how we&#39;re feeling and go</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.269" end="00:28:51.659" style="s2">a little bit deeper into our emotions</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.559" end="00:28:54.240" style="s2">because a lot of the stuff where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.659" end="00:28:55.799" style="s2">not in in the Western world we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.240" end="00:28:58.970" style="s2">very good at recognizing what emotions</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.799" end="00:29:01.320" style="s2">are where are they and as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.970" end="00:29:05.309" style="s2">feel something that we deem as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.320" end="00:29:09.210" style="s2">negative as an bad as a wrong emotion we</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.309" end="00:29:10.440" style="s2">ignore it we push it down right away but</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.210" end="00:29:12.419" style="s2">as soon as we do that we start attaching</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.440" end="00:29:15.299" style="s2">all these things to it the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.419" end="00:29:17.300" style="s2">circumstances that made us feel that</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.299" end="00:29:20.190" style="s2">that soar</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.300" end="00:29:21.510" style="s2">is now attached to us so every time</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.190" end="00:29:23.309" style="s2">those circumstances come back we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.510" end="00:29:25.500" style="s2">going to feel that sorry we have trapped</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.309" end="00:29:28.350" style="s2">in that cycle of feel in that same</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.500" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">emotion so right a big thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.350" end="00:29:33.600" style="s2">feeling right now society is grief we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:36.390" style="s2">feeling grief for the loss of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:38.250" style="s2">society that loss for our routines and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.390" end="00:29:41.280" style="s2">wants a pre-emptive grief of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.250" end="00:29:43.680" style="s2">going to happen next I&#39;m grieving for</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.280" end="00:29:46.290" style="s2">tomorrow already but grief is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.680" end="00:29:48.240" style="s2">thing but we can&#39;t escape the reality we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.290" end="00:29:51.000" style="s2">keep feeling this on trapped in my home</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.240" end="00:29:53.309" style="s2">owner quarantine I&#39;m trapped but because</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.000" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve been ignoring how I was feeling</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.309" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">about that because I&#39;m still feeling</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:29:59.760" style="s2">that though those feelings gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:03.000" style="s2">coming every time I experience this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.760" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">this quarantine I&#39;m going to feel that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.000" end="00:30:08.330" style="s2">grief again so we assume we meditate and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">say okay okay grief I&#39;m going inside</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.330" end="00:30:12.809" style="s2">hello grief and I actually guide people</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:14.730" style="s2">into talking to their emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.809" end="00:30:18.660" style="s2">acknowledging them and say okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.730" end="00:30:21.120" style="s2">ready I&#39;m strong I&#39;m ready to feel what</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.660" end="00:30:22.679" style="s2">you have to tell me all your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:25.280" style="s2">are just part of your your psyche it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.679" end="00:30:27.570" style="s2">part of you and so if you are not</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.280" end="00:30:29.100" style="s2">experiencing some of them you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.570" end="00:30:31.740" style="s2">experiencing you you know I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.100" end="00:30:33.240" style="s2">you as the full complete person so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.740" end="00:30:35.970" style="s2">sit and we allow these feelings to come</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.240" end="00:30:38.850" style="s2">up and allow yourself to feel a fit of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.970" end="00:30:41.550" style="s2">rage in an appropriate time place or the</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.850" end="00:30:47.220" style="s2">grief the sorrow allow yourself to feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.550" end="00:30:48.780" style="s2">these it&#39;s done without and now and now</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.220" end="00:30:54.380" style="s2">you can fully feel the stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.780" end="00:30:54.380" style="s2">want to feel the joy happiness the love</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.779" end="00:31:02.289" style="s2">and this sort of this rich emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.049" end="00:31:04.950" style="s2">landscape is this a perfect opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.289" end="00:31:07.509" style="s2">to practice once this ISM all the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.950" end="00:31:11.080" style="s2">yeah you know this is never a shortage</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.509" end="00:31:13.029" style="s2">of emotions that are arising in us in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.080" end="00:31:17.229" style="s2">day to day basis or a moment to moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.029" end="00:31:21.539" style="s2">basis even so something else was coming</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.229" end="00:31:23.999" style="s2">up because I know a lot of people who I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.539" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">guess when they encounter stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.999" end="00:31:28.419" style="s2">they&#39;re like oh they&#39;re just like they</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:30.369" style="s2">feel a resonance with it like oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.419" end="00:31:32.649" style="s2">already been doing that and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.369" end="00:31:34.809" style="s2">some extent right and it&#39;s people mostly</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.649" end="00:31:37.539" style="s2">in maybe extreme sports like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.809" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">wilderness training or or like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.539" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">like maybe a lot of doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.519" end="00:31:45.460" style="s2">entrepreneurs the people who have</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.719" style="s2">military definitely military when</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.460" end="00:31:49.179" style="s2">there&#39;s like a high risk high</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.719" end="00:31:52.330" style="s2">uncertainty and it&#39;s like if they want</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.179" end="00:31:56.859" style="s2">to perform with excellence in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.330" end="00:31:58.839" style="s2">domain then they have to really be stoic</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.859" end="00:32:02.460" style="s2">even though they might not have that</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.839" end="00:32:06.549" style="s2">word or that philosophy put on it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.460" end="00:32:08.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s there just being stoic not just</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.549" end="00:32:10.869" style="s2">but sometimes they&#39;re just being stoic</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.440" end="00:32:13.479" style="s2">in that domain like the main of going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.869" end="00:32:15.070" style="s2">war domain of going to the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.479" end="00:32:18.339" style="s2">hospital or whatever or whatever they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.070" end="00:32:19.960" style="s2">doing and where stoicism is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.339" end="00:32:21.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s like it&#39;s like what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.960" end="00:32:23.109" style="s2">doing in that domain it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.460" end="00:32:27.700" style="s2">local domain it&#39;s globalize for your</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.109" end="00:32:28.629" style="s2">whole life and like how do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:29.649" style="s2">though right</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.629" end="00:32:31.509" style="s2">how do you do that you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.649" end="00:32:34.239" style="s2">memorize propositions and give them El</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.509" end="00:32:36.159" style="s2">service to them it&#39;s like epictetus says</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.239" end="00:32:40.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like don&#39;t explain your philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.159" end="00:32:42.489" style="s2">and body it and what I really like about</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.119" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">this particular practice of the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.489" end="00:32:47.830" style="s2">breath and breath work in general it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:49.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s like it anchors you in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.830" end="00:32:51.700" style="s2">breath and you&#39;re always breathing so it</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.839" end="00:32:54.249" style="s2">has that opportunity to colobus the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.700" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">philosophy to every moment yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.249" end="00:33:01.029" style="s2">moment are talking about with extreme</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:33:03.429" style="s2">sport athletes military doctors they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.029" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">experiencing flow state ready when they</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.429" end="00:33:07.869" style="s2">get deep into that moment of just</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:09.760" style="s2">performing its flow State everything</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.869" end="00:33:12.730" style="s2">just happens perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.760" end="00:33:14.770" style="s2">and we can measure flow state when</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.730" end="00:33:18.700" style="s2">you&#39;re in flow you actually turn off</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.770" end="00:33:21.400" style="s2">your prefrontal cortex and you just you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.700" end="00:33:23.770" style="s2">just go you just act and you you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.400" end="00:33:26.200" style="s2">your entirety and you see it moving and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.770" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">slowing and we we experience the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.200" end="00:33:30.400" style="s2">thing when we do breath work when we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:35.320" style="s2">that deep rhythmic breath pattern that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.400" end="00:33:37.000" style="s2">we do we start to go into temporal</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.320" end="00:33:39.010" style="s2">hypofrontality that&#39;s what it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.000" end="00:33:42.970" style="s2">is where you shut down the front part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.010" end="00:33:45.490" style="s2">your brain so through a a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.970" end="00:33:48.310" style="s2">breath practice we trigger ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.490" end="00:33:51.280" style="s2">into flow state which is what these</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.310" end="00:33:53.050" style="s2">extreme athletes are doing but because</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.280" end="00:33:55.780" style="s2">our breath and more control of it when</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.050" end="00:33:58.150" style="s2">when somebody is a skiing down the side</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.780" end="00:34:00.940" style="s2">of a mountain they&#39;re not consciously in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.150" end="00:34:02.980" style="s2">control of the experience it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.940" end="00:34:04.210" style="s2">subconscious control it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.980" end="00:34:06.610" style="s2">quicker than their conscious mind can</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.210" end="00:34:09.520" style="s2">have can can&#39;t control it our conscious</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.610" end="00:34:11.560" style="s2">mind experiences the world just a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.520" end="00:34:13.149" style="s2">fraction of a second behind it actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.560" end="00:34:15.610" style="s2">happening you have to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.149" end="00:34:16.990" style="s2">before we experience it when we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.610" end="00:34:19.240" style="s2">flow state that does our body that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.990" end="00:34:21.250" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for that through our</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.240" end="00:34:23.320" style="s2">bodies is acting when we go into our</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.250" end="00:34:26.770" style="s2">breath practice we&#39;re consciously going</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.320" end="00:34:30.970" style="s2">in to that flow state so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.770" end="00:34:33.190" style="s2">this tool in our back pocket to go into</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.970" end="00:34:37.120" style="s2">that state whenever we want we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.190" end="00:34:43.740" style="s2">trigger that that&#39;s flow which allows us</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.120" end="00:34:43.740" style="s2">to be stoic in those moments</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.909" end="00:34:51.020" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering too maybe there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.740" end="00:34:54.679" style="s2">open inquiry for both of us to go down</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.020" end="00:34:57.380" style="s2">but like those anti flow moments is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.679" end="00:34:58.520" style="s2">tortured way to put it but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.380" end="00:35:02.109" style="s2">know what I&#39;m trying to adjust your</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.520" end="00:35:04.040" style="s2">towards here is that like those those</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.109" end="00:35:06.109" style="s2">performance athletes who are in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.040" end="00:35:09.560" style="s2">flow state and that domain and then if</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.109" end="00:35:12.520" style="s2">you can manage to anchor yourself on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.560" end="00:35:17.450" style="s2">breath and then engender a flow state</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.520" end="00:35:18.500" style="s2">but there is some aspects where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.450" end="00:35:18.980" style="s2">like it just feels like you&#39;re not in</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.500" end="00:35:22.790" style="s2">flow</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.980" end="00:35:24.950" style="s2">you&#39;re like imprisoned in a way and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.790" end="00:35:26.630" style="s2">you think is going on in those moments</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.950" end="00:35:28.520" style="s2">if you can find maybe if you can tease</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.630" end="00:35:35.660" style="s2">out some kind of universal aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.520" end="00:35:37.250" style="s2">them when you&#39;re what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.660" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">your thoughts when you&#39;re Kent when</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2">you&#39;re stuck in imprisons you are</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.990" end="00:44:10.270" style="s2">that and then reflecting on it afterward</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.690" end="00:44:12.309" style="s2">I&#39;m like you know what it&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.270" end="00:44:15.369" style="s2">ethical act just being him you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.309" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">because he inspired others and then that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.369" end="00:44:18.069" style="s2">came to mind when you you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:19.450" style="s2">that about like in the grocery store or</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.069" end="00:44:19.990" style="s2">whatever and if you can maintain that</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.450" end="00:44:21.550" style="s2">serenity</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.990" end="00:44:23.410" style="s2">people are gonna sense that people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.550" end="00:44:25.690" style="s2">gonna feel it mm-hmm they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.410" end="00:44:29.369" style="s2">inspired by it yeah and the more you</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.690" end="00:44:32.380" style="s2">practice it the the more you feel it we</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.369" end="00:44:33.700" style="s2">just it&#39;s like with insulin when you eat</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.380" end="00:44:36.609" style="s2">sugar you release insulin and instantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.700" end="00:44:39.819" style="s2">helps assure get to the cells but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.609" end="00:44:41.770" style="s2">the more you have from that insulin the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.819" end="00:44:44.589" style="s2">harder it is for the cells to work with</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.770" end="00:44:47.260" style="s2">it um so all of our cells have receptors</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.589" end="00:44:49.299" style="s2">to feel things we have neuropeptides are</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.260" end="00:44:51.010" style="s2">the sort of the the molecule of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.299" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">we have an emotion we released</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.010" end="00:44:56.950" style="s2">neuropeptide of that emotion so if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:44:59.619" style="s2">feel stressed a lot we release a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.950" end="00:45:02.109" style="s2">stressful neuropeptides and so our cells</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.619" end="00:45:04.660" style="s2">in our body become very good at feeling</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.109" end="00:45:08.290" style="s2">stressed we developed more receptors</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.660" end="00:45:10.540" style="s2">ourselves to feel stress and so because</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.290" end="00:45:12.609" style="s2">we have more receptors to feel more</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.540" end="00:45:15.490" style="s2">stress we want to start to feel more</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.609" end="00:45:17.049" style="s2">stress to feed those receptors so we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.490" end="00:45:19.869" style="s2">more stressful which makes us what to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.049" end="00:45:21.460" style="s2">have more stress so the emotion that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.869" end="00:45:23.349" style="s2">focus on more is what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.460" end="00:45:28.230" style="s2">feel more of and we&#39;ve come better at</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.349" end="00:45:31.240" style="s2">feeling it so when we practice gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.230" end="00:45:32.650" style="s2">gratitude meditation where you just sit</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.240" end="00:45:34.059" style="s2">and think what are the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.650" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">grateful for at the end of your day</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.059" end="00:45:36.670" style="s2">before you go to bed you open your</p>

<p begin="00:45:36.670" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">you&#39;re grateful for today</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.280" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">do that all the time every day you</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.560" end="00:45:47.550" style="s2">practice attitude pretty soon you start</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">to become better at feeling grateful and</p>

<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">America becomes more unstable like I say</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.530" end="00:47:11.670" style="s2">if the election gets postponed or</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:12.930" style="s2">canceled and then some kind of civil war</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.670" end="00:47:13.740" style="s2">breaks out and everyone&#39;s feeling this</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.410" end="00:47:40.560" style="s2">politics and here in Canada we often see</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.940" end="00:47:42.870" style="s2">the politics of fear right and one kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.560" end="00:47:45.480" style="s2">of like threat I want to go down then it</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.140" end="00:47:56.880" style="s2">flight aspect of it but like listless</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.530" end="00:47:59.190" style="s2">maybe turn our attention to the fight</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.880" end="00:48:02.040" style="s2">aspect and having wrong relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.190" end="00:48:04.830" style="s2">with the fight response in the flight or</p>

<p begin="00:48:10.590" end="00:48:14.700" style="s2">toxic masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.540" end="00:48:16.890" style="s2">maybe we can redefine how to repurpose</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.700" end="00:48:20.010" style="s2">it here of having wrong relationship</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.890" end="00:48:21.900" style="s2">with the fight response and I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:49:42.300" end="00:49:49.020" style="s2">masculinity but then we were mature and</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.230" end="00:49:51.480" style="s2">we become this way the book goes and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.020" end="00:49:53.760" style="s2">become horrified by that and we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.480" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">this this turn on something and we</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.760" end="00:50:00.790" style="s2">develop this this white masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:05.700" style="s2">where we shrink away from that power and</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.790" end="00:50:08.650" style="s2">we develop terms like metrosexual and</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.700" end="00:50:11.530" style="s2">those those terms like that I might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.650" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">touch with you higher now but it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.530" end="00:50:17.470" style="s2">that reversal of masculinity and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:21.070" style="s2">of that and then we mature again and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.470" end="00:50:24.310" style="s2">develop the black masculinity where you</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.070" end="00:50:28.420" style="s2">are where you own your sexuality you own</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.310" end="00:50:31.930" style="s2">your masculinity you own your rage as a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.420" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">tool within you to use and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.930" end="00:50:37.150" style="s2">we are allowed to be angry and feel our</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:39.760" style="s2">anger and recognize our anger but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.150" end="00:50:43.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t control us when we were a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.760" end="00:50:46.600" style="s2">younger are like when we were 16 little</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:53.670" style="s2">behave that way</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.700" end="00:50:59.350" style="s2">some people don&#39;t mature out of that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.830" end="00:51:02.890" style="s2">we have a society that encourages that</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.350" end="00:51:06.430" style="s2">kind of where we be call that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.890" end="00:51:10.360" style="s2">out of control purging masculinity as</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.430" end="00:51:12.580" style="s2">what is masculine right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.360" end="00:51:15.100" style="s2">not this maturity that you and I have</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.580" end="00:51:19.210" style="s2">about owning our masculinity owning our</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.100" end="00:51:22.030" style="s2">rage moving our sexuality that is what</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.210" end="00:51:23.860" style="s2">masculine is with that disconnect and</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.030" end="00:51:25.360" style="s2">that misunderstanding of toxic</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.860" end="00:51:29.170" style="s2">masculinity comes from it seamless</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.360" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">generate its its celebrated in the media</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.170" end="00:51:35.290" style="s2">in Hollywood but that is bad to be it at</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:38.140" style="s2">the same time so being able to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.290" end="00:51:40.090" style="s2">it and own it and mature past it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.140" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s part of stoicism too</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.090" end="00:51:45.250" style="s2">is to be able to recognize within</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:47.310" style="s2">yourself when you&#39;re feeling these</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.250" end="00:51:50.860" style="s2">things when you&#39;re feeling that that</p>
