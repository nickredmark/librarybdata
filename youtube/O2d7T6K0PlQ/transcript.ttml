<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:19.520" style="s2">to be a masculine man</p>

<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">very good um so yeah my name&#39;s aaron uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">today we&#39;re talking about meta-modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">masculinity and the goal with this event</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">is to create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">collaborative space where we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">dialogue about masculinity and what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">means to be a man</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">because from my perspective this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">conversation isn&#39;t happening very</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">in the public space so again i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2">here to lecture</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:25.920" style="s2">but i&#39;m going to give a brief</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">introduction for a few minutes and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.920" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">afterwards so what do i mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">term</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:35.120" style="s2">meta-modern masculinity so metamodernism</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.120" end="00:02:38.160" style="s2">an evolving term that carries diverse</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">implications</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.160" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">but to put it simply meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">integrates</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">the project of modernism with its</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">postmodern critique</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">it transcends and includes both</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">taking what&#39;s useful and discarding</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">what&#39;s not uh the idealistic</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">naive child of modernism develops into</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">the ironic</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">cynical teenager of post-modernism which</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">in turn develops into the wise</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">adult of metamodernism who hasn&#39;t buried</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">or repressed the idolistic child</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">or the skeptical teenager but has</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">integrated them both into his being</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:13.519" style="s2">so when it comes to masculinity uh we</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:17.840" style="s2">have these modern ideals</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.519" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">of strength stoicism and warriorship</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.840" end="00:03:21.760" style="s2">men are the breadwinners they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">providers they&#39;re impervious resilient</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.760" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">independent in control and in charge</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">modernism frames this</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">as simply being the nature of men it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">grounded in biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.319" style="s2">the post-modern critique of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.480" style="s2">man is that perhaps strength</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.319" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">stoicism and warriorship is not only</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.480" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">unhelpful</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">but unhealthy perhaps masculinity is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">biological but socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">and thrust upon men making them</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">tyrannical repressive of their emotions</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">violent perhaps we should be questioning</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.360" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">this modern notion of manhood</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:57.519" style="s2">or even throw it out the meta modern man</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.439" style="s2">mediates between the two so what we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.519" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">masculinity is partly biological</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.439" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s partly a social construct</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">perhaps we have impoverished and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">traumatized young men</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">by pushing them too hard to be tough</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">competitive and independent</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">um conversely perhaps we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">ignoring</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">the biology of men banishing their</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">masculinity from the public space</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">into the shadows where their repressed</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:20.799" style="s2">wounded manhood</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">lashes out violently in inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.799" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">ways at inappropriate times</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">so where the modern project is one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:28.639" style="s2">rationality and science</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:29.919" style="s2">and the post-modern project is one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.639" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.919" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">the meta-modern project is spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a project of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">of balance of transcendence rather than</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.160" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">the modern king or the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">he becomes the philosopher king</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">so we live in a time of great</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">uncertainty but the meta-modern man is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">brave enough to journey into the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.520" style="s2">uncharted lands of the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">and become a father to the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.520" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">so what does meta-modern masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">what does it look like i don&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">you probably don&#39;t know either</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">um that&#39;s why we&#39;re having a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:07.680" style="s2">so my hope is that we enter this space</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:10.720" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.680" end="00:05:12.160" style="s2">collective unknowingness and together</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.720" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">move towards a place</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.160" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">of knowingness through integrating the</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.320" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">different perspectives of this community</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.800" style="s2">um hopefully this conversation will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">the first of many we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.800" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s a lot to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">here but for today</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.759" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to start with something</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.720" style="s2">basic</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.759" end="00:05:31.680" style="s2">so this is going to be collaborative um</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.720" end="00:05:33.199" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a discussion we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.680" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">going to break out into</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.199" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">partners groups of two as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">icebreaker</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">and the goal is to sort of get into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">collaborative mode</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">through this so i&#39;m going to give you a</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">prompt and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">the prompt is what is masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">very basic and you can interpret that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">how you wish</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">what is masculinity and in the breakout</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:57.680" style="s2">rooms with your partner</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:59.919" style="s2">one person is going to answer the prompt</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.680" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">for two minutes and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.919" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll um sorry the second partner is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">going to mirror for one minute</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">then you&#39;ll switch and the second</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">partner will answer the prompt for two</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:11.440" style="s2">followed by the other one mirroring them</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">back for one minute so for a total of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.440" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">six minutes</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">okay and mirroring means paraphrasing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">to the speaker what you think they just</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">tried to express so that the speaker can</p>

<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">that you understood them does that make</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">the idea is to actively listen and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">try and embody the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">perspective</p>
