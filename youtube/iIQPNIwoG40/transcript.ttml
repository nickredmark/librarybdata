<p begin="00:00:08.900" end="00:00:14.430" style="s2">Andrew Sweeney has written a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:17.970" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and I&#39;ve made quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.430" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">few films about him since we started</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.970" end="00:00:23.070" style="s2">following Jordan Peterson he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">getting some quite intense criticism why</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.070" end="00:00:27.660" style="s2">I caught up with Andrew to talk it</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:29.430" style="s2">through I guess we&#39;ve been engaging</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.660" end="00:00:30.930" style="s2">pretty deeply with his thought for quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.430" end="00:00:34.020" style="s2">a while and also reading a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.930" end="00:00:36.480" style="s2">criticisms and come to a view about why</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">it is that he provokes such a strong</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.480" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">reaction among so many people and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">that maybe says about his thoughts where</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.649" style="s2">and what it says about the culture at</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:49.620" style="s2">large what is it that he&#39;s saying that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.649" end="00:00:54.030" style="s2">seems to be so indigestible for some</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.620" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">people and is it and the parrot the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:57.870" style="s2">great paradox as well as that he a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:01:01.140" style="s2">of his thought talks about the necessity</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.870" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">of talking with people who don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.140" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">with the understanding that people have</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:07.080" style="s2">different views based on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:09.750" style="s2">temperaments and it seems to point a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.080" end="00:01:12.110" style="s2">to to getting past some of the divisions</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.750" end="00:01:15.120" style="s2">in the culture but the irony is he</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.110" end="00:01:17.130" style="s2">himself has seemed to be an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.120" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">divisive figure how do you make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.130" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">that kind of paradox okay well I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:25.500" style="s2">the moment like the big moment right</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">where all this began is the big gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.500" end="00:01:29.190" style="s2">moment and I don&#39;t mean with Kathy</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">Newman I mean with Trump I think Trump</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.190" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">was the gotcha moment for the culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:35.760" style="s2">right it was the moment when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:37.740" style="s2">progressive bubble burst</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.760" end="00:01:41.970" style="s2">it was the moment when the progressive</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.740" end="00:01:44.550" style="s2">got God and I so to speak right so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.970" end="00:01:47.790" style="s2">think it&#39;s I&#39;ve been thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.550" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">in terms of you know how I was before</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.790" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">Trump was elected and you could say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">a I&#39;m a sort of a political typical</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:02:00.120" style="s2">progressive you know with the lesbian</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:03.830" style="s2">mom and very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.120" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">you know pro-environment the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.830" end="00:02:09.330" style="s2">worldview there&#39;s something you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">empty about it right but it&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.330" end="00:02:15.180" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve sort of framed it before as</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">the hidden shadow of liberalism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.180" end="00:02:20.490" style="s2">this kind of ideology of inclusivity</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:22.350" style="s2">that also is a tribalism that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.490" end="00:02:24.420" style="s2">admit that it&#39;s a tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.350" end="00:02:26.820" style="s2">we are very very tolerant to to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.420" end="00:02:29.490" style="s2">everybody except for traditionalists</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.820" end="00:02:31.200" style="s2">right because there&#39;s this terrible fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.490" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">of traditionalism you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">conservatism there&#39;s this intense fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:40.290" style="s2">of progressives about religion</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">do you consider Peterson to be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.290" end="00:02:43.710" style="s2">he&#39;s certainly arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">traditionalist values but but I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.710" end="00:02:47.970" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeper like he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">and he&#39;s often seen by a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.970" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the criticism he&#39;s a regressive</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s knocking back so I I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:02:56.670" style="s2">actually what he&#39;s arguing for is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">slightly deeper integration of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.670" end="00:03:00.300" style="s2">traditional values my fence is with with</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:02.280" style="s2">Peterson is that he doesn&#39;t really fit</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">into that culture war narrative so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.280" end="00:03:07.320" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s looking to transcend it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:09.740" style="s2">some ways well exactly he&#39;s he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.320" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">pure traditionalist right he&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.740" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">conservative you know in the purest</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">sense of that world he&#39;s not arguing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:21.960" style="s2">about going back to traditionalism he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:23.820" style="s2">arguing about transcending and including</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.960" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">it to use Wilbur&#39;s language right he</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.820" end="00:03:28.110" style="s2">wants to rescue the father right at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:30.690" style="s2">bottom of the you know the whale this is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.110" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">always the mythological terms he is he</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.690" end="00:03:36.900" style="s2">wants to rescue this tradition no but he</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:41.880" style="s2">that he doesn&#39;t he doesn&#39;t he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.900" end="00:03:45.060" style="s2">fully enclosed within it he&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.880" end="00:03:47.150" style="s2">very open progressive you know person</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.060" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">you know and he&#39;s also you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.150" end="00:03:51.990" style="s2">think the reason he&#39;s so much in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:54.240" style="s2">center of the discussion right now is</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.990" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">that he can see all the way all the way</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.240" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">down to the bottom right to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">base of the culture and he can also see</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:05.370" style="s2">up right there&#39;s this verticality right</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:07.650" style="s2">of his thinking so he understood he</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.370" end="00:04:10.350" style="s2">understands that he understands the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.650" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">progressive view and he understands a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.350" end="00:04:15.030" style="s2">postmodern view and he criticizes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:19.140" style="s2">pathology right I very you know strongly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.030" end="00:04:22.830" style="s2">that the postmodern view has become it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.140" end="00:04:26.550" style="s2">reached it&#39;s sort of maximum you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.830" end="00:04:28.920" style="s2">pathology it&#39;s become sick right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:32.190" style="s2">not just theorizing about the world he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.920" end="00:04:34.979" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s bringing an actual change to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.190" end="00:04:35.790" style="s2">people&#39;s lives that that is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.979" end="00:04:38.100" style="s2">profound</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.790" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">it just whether you agree with him or</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.100" end="00:04:45.660" style="s2">not like me I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been accused</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:48.570" style="s2">of being a JP fanboy and I I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.660" end="00:04:50.810" style="s2">really trying to engage with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.570" end="00:04:53.940" style="s2">criticisms that I found and to really</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.810" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">interrogate my own view around him and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.940" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">try and understand where the criticisms</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.540" style="s2">are coming from and trying to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">say well are there spaces that he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.540" end="00:05:07.470" style="s2">seeing are there things that that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">wrong about because Oh on the overview</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.470" end="00:05:12.030" style="s2">if you look at something like maps of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">meaning and the Bible lectures and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.030" end="00:05:16.260" style="s2">really understand the the broader</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:20.160" style="s2">outlines of his thought there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.260" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">something almost anti anti intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.160" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">about it because almost everything he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:26.460" style="s2">saying is pointing back into the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:28.890" style="s2">in some way it&#39;s saying look you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.460" end="00:05:33.300" style="s2">already doing this look at the way your</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.890" end="00:05:35.460" style="s2">your systems your meaning systems work</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.300" end="00:05:36.780" style="s2">in the world look at the way you respond</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.460" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">to this piece of art look at this way</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:41.760" style="s2">you respond to music and he&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.550" end="00:05:45.150" style="s2">put putting pieces together so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.760" end="00:05:48.120" style="s2">kind of I find there&#39;s almost very</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.150" end="00:05:51.090" style="s2">little there&#39;s very little pure</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.120" end="00:05:52.740" style="s2">intellectual abstraction to argue with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.090" end="00:05:54.390" style="s2">lot of the time it seems to be pointing</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.740" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">back into the world which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.390" end="00:05:59.430" style="s2">quite infuriating for the people arguing</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:06:03.330" style="s2">with him is that what he&#39;s saying seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:09.150" style="s2">a lot of what he&#39;s saying is is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:12.510" style="s2">unarguable and what I found in almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.150" end="00:06:15.450" style="s2">all of the the pieces of criticism of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.510" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">him or not without exception but but</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.450" end="00:06:21.090" style="s2">generally without exception is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.280" end="00:06:22.470" style="s2">real resentment in there and it comes</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.090" end="00:06:23.490" style="s2">out very very quickly when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.470" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">reading it it&#39;s either a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.490" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">dismissiveness or saying oh he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:30.570" style="s2">nothing worthwhile to say or or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:32.280" style="s2">and you and it&#39;s really what&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.570" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">fascinating is that&#39;s a central part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.280" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">his thought and a central part of his</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:38.130" style="s2">thought is to say pay attention to your</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:43.620" style="s2">resentment it&#39;s telling you something</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.130" end="00:06:45.150" style="s2">and the paradox is I&#39;d say 95 percent if</p>

<p begin="00:07:51.129" end="00:07:55.479" style="s2">they&#39;ve lost the ability to communicate</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.550" end="00:08:12.819" style="s2">abstraction right and they have an</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.589" end="00:08:16.089" style="s2">embodied their their wisdom so Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.819" end="00:08:18.520" style="s2">is a very embody type of type of thinker</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.089" end="00:08:19.870" style="s2">yeah this is really interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.520" end="00:08:22.810" style="s2">make that connection to embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.870" end="00:08:24.759" style="s2">because this is where I think I</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.810" end="00:08:28.560" style="s2">resonated the most with Peterson because</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.759" end="00:08:30.940" style="s2">I&#39;ve done a lot of sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.560" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">psychological work a lot of Jungian</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.940" end="00:08:34.990" style="s2">shadow work about integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:37.479" style="s2">shadow and that was really the subject</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.990" end="00:08:40.930" style="s2">of my first interview with him was I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.479" end="00:08:44.829" style="s2">never heard anyone describe the process</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.930" end="00:08:47.769" style="s2">of personal integration as clearly as</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.829" end="00:08:51.430" style="s2">him and then to link that to this deep</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.769" end="00:08:53.380" style="s2">story of the of the logos more aligned</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.430" end="00:08:55.570" style="s2">with this sort of deep principle of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.380" end="00:08:58.420" style="s2">Western culture this was really exciting</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.570" end="00:08:59.140" style="s2">for me and and suddenly started to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.420" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.140" end="00:09:02.440" style="s2">I mean I&#39;d always done a lot of the work</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:04.570" style="s2">that I&#39;d done in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.440" end="00:09:07.750" style="s2">slightly more I guess a more new-age</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.570" end="00:09:11.290" style="s2">kind of way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.750" end="00:09:13.420" style="s2">spirituality and using young in in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.290" end="00:09:15.190" style="s2">way and then to hear that kind of really</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.420" end="00:09:18.400" style="s2">deeply connected to like the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.190" end="00:09:21.480" style="s2">story and the the it really felt I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.400" end="00:09:23.650" style="s2">grounding a lot of everything I knew</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.480" end="00:09:25.330" style="s2">everything I knew most certainly that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.650" end="00:09:27.610" style="s2">I&#39;d experienced myself and integrated</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.330" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">myself and an embodied in my own life</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.610" end="00:09:31.900" style="s2">then suddenly had this intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.740" end="00:09:33.310" style="s2">construct that just as Peterson says</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.900" end="00:09:36.580" style="s2">about his lectures it just went click</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.310" end="00:09:39.370" style="s2">click click click click and I felt this</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.580" end="00:09:41.620" style="s2">sort of deeper intellectual integration</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.370" end="00:09:45.220" style="s2">with something I had already embodied</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.620" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a sense that I get I</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.220" end="00:09:48.520" style="s2">mean very few people I think are</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">actually living a fully embodied and</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.520" end="00:09:52.180" style="s2">fully living out their philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:54.970" style="s2">world because it&#39;s such a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.180" end="00:09:56.530" style="s2">thing to do it&#39;s such a difficult like</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.970" end="00:09:58.330" style="s2">you say to look at your envi to look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.530" end="00:10:00.670" style="s2">your resentment to really admit that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.330" end="00:10:06.670" style="s2">that you have it is a really difficult</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.670" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">process yeah well I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.670" end="00:10:13.750" style="s2">shadow&#39; notion is is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:15.640" style="s2">essential right it&#39;s it&#39;s an essential</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.750" end="00:10:18.220" style="s2">notion right that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.640" end="00:10:19.810" style="s2">reintroduced to the to the culture we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.220" end="00:10:22.420" style="s2">need to stop looking for the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.810" end="00:10:26.740" style="s2">outside of ourselves you know we need to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.420" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">stop you know we need to stop with our</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.740" end="00:10:33.060" style="s2">categories of people being this or that</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:36.190" style="s2">and being bad and you know and our</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.060" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">self-righteousness and our you know all</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.190" end="00:10:41.590" style="s2">of all of this and we need to admit in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.420" style="s2">our cells that were also the worst</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.590" end="00:10:46.600" style="s2">person right he&#39;s bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:49.270" style="s2">traditional ism and mysticism into the</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.600" end="00:10:52.330" style="s2">conversation which is terrifying as hell</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.270" end="00:10:54.700" style="s2">for people yeah who have do believe that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.330" end="00:10:57.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone beyond that who we we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.700" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">to a new level of society we we&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.700" end="00:11:01.570" style="s2">beyond all these ignorant religions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:03.339" style="s2">all these ignorant traditions and now we</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.570" end="00:11:05.470" style="s2">are we&#39;re becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.339" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">enlightened and progressive and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.470" end="00:11:09.640" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go back there and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.260" style="s2">don&#39;t want to look you know back into</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.640" end="00:11:13.240" style="s2">our origins but you know Peterson you</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.260" end="00:11:15.760" style="s2">know he says it&#39;s not capitalism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.240" end="00:11:17.980" style="s2">it&#39;s deep in our origins where where</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.760" end="00:11:20.260" style="s2">where the shadow lives where you know so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.980" end="00:11:22.360" style="s2">there&#39;s this unintegrated tradition in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.260" end="00:11:25.300" style="s2">the culture right this this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.360" end="00:11:27.880" style="s2">profound point that that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.300" end="00:11:31.810" style="s2">before and I thought was really worth</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.880" end="00:11:34.030" style="s2">exploring about mysticism because there</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.810" end="00:11:35.470" style="s2">is something like even in the the Pankaj</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.030" end="00:11:38.260" style="s2">Mishra article where he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.470" end="00:11:41.230" style="s2">fascist mysticism this there is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.260" end="00:11:45.460" style="s2">huge fear among the sort of secular</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.230" end="00:11:48.250" style="s2">materialist classes of what this means</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.460" end="00:11:50.170" style="s2">to bring Europe from the depths for</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.250" end="00:11:52.030" style="s2">example to talk about the archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.170" end="00:11:56.050" style="s2">ground of religion to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.030" end="00:11:58.870" style="s2">mythological structures because there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.050" end="00:12:01.420" style="s2">this sense that well we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.870" end="00:12:03.370" style="s2">got rid of that and that has a checkered</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.420" end="00:12:05.410" style="s2">history because there was something of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.370" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">the occult behind say the fascists for</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.410" end="00:12:09.850" style="s2">example there is some there is this sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">of a cult tradition that feeds off its</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.850" end="00:12:17.230" style="s2">archetypal force of mythology and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:19.750" style="s2">banished that but there&#39;s also a sense I</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.230" end="00:12:22.540" style="s2">think among a lot of people that in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.750" end="00:12:24.280" style="s2">banishing that we&#39;ve also banished</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.540" end="00:12:26.650" style="s2">spirituality we&#39;ve also banished</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.280" end="00:12:29.740" style="s2">religion we&#39;ve also banished some deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.650" end="00:12:31.000" style="s2">part of the human soul and maybe a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.740" end="00:12:33.310" style="s2">of what we&#39;re seeing playing out in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.000" end="00:12:35.980" style="s2">culture right now the kind of is the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.310" end="00:12:39.670" style="s2">of the age of materialism we sort of get</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.980" end="00:12:42.610" style="s2">a sense of this multi-level crisis which</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.670" end="00:12:45.910" style="s2">comes from seeing the world as only a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.610" end="00:12:49.000" style="s2">sort of set of material forces with no</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.910" end="00:12:51.400" style="s2">deeper soul or spirit and it&#39;s it told</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.000" end="00:12:52.690" style="s2">me you cannot sorry about that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.400" end="00:12:54.850" style="s2">continue you can&#39;t even see the word</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.690" end="00:12:57.220" style="s2">soul right it&#39;s it&#39;s taboo you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.850" end="00:13:00.460" style="s2">even say the word sacred it&#39;s taboo you</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.460" end="00:13:04.120" style="s2">can&#39;t even have a discussion about it</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.960" end="00:13:07.570" style="s2">without offending a lot of people right</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.120" end="00:13:11.890" style="s2">yeah and this is this is something I</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.570" end="00:13:13.930" style="s2">think that uh a lot of people that I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.890" end="00:13:18.520" style="s2">lot of the networks that I&#39;m part of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.930" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">talk about reanimating the world either</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.990" end="00:13:36.339" style="s2">political response to Peterson to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.029" end="00:13:39.629" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s doing and he is</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.339" end="00:13:42.129" style="s2">perhaps their best ally and the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.629" end="00:13:44.589" style="s2">exponent of this kind of reanimating of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.129" end="00:13:47.050" style="s2">the sacred that you will ever that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.589" end="00:13:49.540" style="s2">will ever have and his success shows the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.050" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">thirst for the knit for that reanimation</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.540" end="00:13:52.899" style="s2">of the sacred can you talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.279" end="00:13:54.910" style="s2">kind of mysticism that he&#39;s bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.899" end="00:13:56.949" style="s2">fear that it brings up I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.949" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">I I do actual spiritual practice why did</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.189" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">they keep calling Peterson a fascist you</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:08.129" style="s2">know and why is because fascism I guess</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:12.189" style="s2">is a kind of you know dark mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.129" end="00:14:14.709" style="s2">mm-hmm and and perhaps they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.189" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">legitimate to be to be afraid of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.709" end="00:14:20.410" style="s2">but again they&#39;re focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:23.589" style="s2">pathology and they&#39;re not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.410" end="00:14:25.509" style="s2">enlightened aspects of mysticism I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.589" end="00:14:29.529" style="s2">mentioned this as a kind of a joke that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.509" end="00:14:32.139" style="s2">he&#39;s transgender you know it&#39;s a joke</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.529" end="00:14:35.259" style="s2">and it&#39;s a provocation right because</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.139" end="00:14:36.550" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that he you know the things</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.259" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2">he talks about her you know he talks</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.550" end="00:14:39.399" style="s2">about cleaning your room you know who</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:41.380" style="s2">cleans your room you know who tells you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.399" end="00:14:43.509" style="s2">to clean your room your mother right you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.380" end="00:14:45.699" style="s2">know he&#39;s he&#39;s very motherly he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.509" end="00:14:48.339" style="s2">maternal with people he cries about</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.699" end="00:14:50.949" style="s2">young men you know he wants the best for</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.339" end="00:14:53.079" style="s2">you know he&#39;s very caring right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.949" end="00:14:54.610" style="s2">very maternal but he&#39;s also very fierce</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.079" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">and masculine so he&#39;s he&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.610" end="00:14:58.560" style="s2">integrated this masculine and feminine</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:03.790" style="s2">rather than being just a hyper masculine</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:06.670" style="s2">you know a chauvinistic man which a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.790" end="00:15:08.170" style="s2">of people are accusing him of being he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.670" end="00:15:09.550" style="s2">integrated the male and the female which</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:11.980" style="s2">makes them very powerful and put some</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.550" end="00:15:14.500" style="s2">kind of in the center of both so he</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.980" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">could he can talk to that he can he can</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.500" end="00:15:18.130" style="s2">he can communicate to both who men and</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:20.589" style="s2">both women to the left and the right you</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.130" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">know he can have conversations with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.589" end="00:15:24.670" style="s2">know conservatives like Shapiro and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:27.129" style="s2">can also have conversations with you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.670" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">know left-wing people like Russell Brand</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.129" end="00:15:32.199" style="s2">Reich he can and and if he can so he</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">sort of he&#39;s transgender in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.199" end="00:15:35.829" style="s2">that spiritually transgender in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.589" style="s2">sense that he&#39;s integrated the male and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.829" end="00:15:41.889" style="s2">female inside of them and you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.589" end="00:15:43.240" style="s2">think I don&#39;t know if people have</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.889" end="00:15:44.709" style="s2">noticed this because he</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.240" end="00:15:46.779" style="s2">always being accused of being you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.709" end="00:15:48.940" style="s2">the patriarchy you know but I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.779" end="00:15:52.089" style="s2">like yeah I think he&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.940" end="00:15:54.580" style="s2">postmodern than then then then he</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.089" end="00:15:55.839" style="s2">pretends to be or that he really is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.580" end="00:15:57.550" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t for example he</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.839" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go to church but he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.550" end="00:16:01.959" style="s2">integrate the aspects of the Bible he</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.130" style="s2">doesn&#39;t again I said that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.959" end="00:16:05.380" style="s2">beginning I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a pure</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.130" end="00:16:06.820" style="s2">traditionalist what&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.380" end="00:16:10.390" style="s2">for me from a very sort of broader</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.820" end="00:16:12.190" style="s2">cultural perspective is where it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.390" end="00:16:15.640" style="s2">that we are in our attitude to religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.190" end="00:16:17.470" style="s2">because we had for a long time the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.640" end="00:16:20.800" style="s2">new atheist the Richard Dawkins and sam</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.470" end="00:16:27.970" style="s2">Harris were certainly dominant online</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.800" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">and certainly very influential in kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.970" end="00:16:31.779" style="s2">of as the gatekeepers of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">like in the kind of media world that</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.779" end="00:16:35.709" style="s2">I&#39;ve been part of talking about religion</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:38.290" style="s2">talking about spirituality would always</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.709" end="00:16:41.260" style="s2">get you wouldn&#39;t get something</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.290" end="00:16:44.950" style="s2">commissioned because it&#39;s cynicism is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.260" end="00:16:46.270" style="s2">very easy position to defend oh no one</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.950" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">sort of making those Commissioning</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.270" end="00:16:52.089" style="s2">decisions at any kind of channel would</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:54.970" style="s2">would want to open the door to religious</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.089" end="00:16:56.709" style="s2">or spiritual content whereas out it it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.970" end="00:16:58.209" style="s2">really seems that with this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.709" end="00:17:00.550" style="s2">evolving conversation that Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.209" end="00:17:02.860" style="s2">Peterson is right at the center of there</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.550" end="00:17:06.309" style="s2">is a certain understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.860" end="00:17:07.630" style="s2">function of religion even if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.309" end="00:17:09.490" style="s2">to reframe it within a sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.630" end="00:17:11.110" style="s2">secular way of these are the best</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.490" end="00:17:13.390" style="s2">stories of how to live our lives that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.110" end="00:17:15.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve come up with and they&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.390" end="00:17:18.160" style="s2">to something that we can achieve in our</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.040" end="00:17:21.550" style="s2">own lives and there is there is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.160" end="00:17:24.069" style="s2">seemingly a shift in that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.550" end="00:17:25.900" style="s2">around validity of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.069" end="00:17:29.650" style="s2">spiritual experience that seems to work</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.900" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">very exciting to me yeah yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.650" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">yeah result he&#39;s opening the black tide</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.510" style="s2">of mysticism right which this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:39.370" style="s2">this is what Freud accused Jung of doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.510" end="00:17:42.490" style="s2">doing opening the black tide of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.370" end="00:17:44.770" style="s2">mysticism right there&#39;s this terror of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.490" end="00:17:47.679" style="s2">this right but there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.770" end="00:17:49.750" style="s2">incredible potential again it may be you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.679" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">could put it in this red religion you</p>

<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:55.210" style="s2">thought the blue church red religion</p>
