<p begin="00:00:04.520" end="00:00:10.710" style="s2">just as the pandemic was starting</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.170" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">Daniel Thorson went into a 75 day silent</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.710" end="00:00:16.770" style="s2">retreat but the monastic academy in</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:19.289" style="s2">Vermont he came out into a postcode</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.770" end="00:00:22.490" style="s2">world and straight into the New York</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.289" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">Times interviews around the globe and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.490" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">became a viral tik-tok hit in China but</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.910" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">there&#39;s an even more interesting story</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:31.980" style="s2">behind it</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">because four years before the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.980" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">exposed how fragile our systems were</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">Daniel was exploring exactly these</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:43.350" style="s2">questions of existential risk through</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:46.200" style="s2">the emerged podcast so I wanted to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.350" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">what he was making of the experience you</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.200" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">read the New York Times article about me</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:53.760" style="s2">then was subsequently contacted by like</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">I&#39;m probably like a dozen or more</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.760" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">different news agencies around the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">like I did a radio interview in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:05.930" style="s2">Australia and in in London and Ireland</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">and and then I definitely the most I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.930" end="00:01:12.450" style="s2">guess the main feeling I feel is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:15.180" style="s2">amusement right now it&#39;s very surreal to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.450" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">come off of asylum a 75 day silent</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.180" end="00:01:23.869" style="s2">retreat and be like thrust into the blue</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">church media machine and kind of just</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.869" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">digested and taken for a ride so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s surreal yeah it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">juxtaposition it&#39;s like you deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">did absolutely nothing or very little</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:43.530" style="s2">for 75 days and that&#39;s become incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">newsworthy for everyone that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.530" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">strangest thing is that that would be at</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:56.460" style="s2">all newsworthy but I think it actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">it reflects how sort of significant</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.460" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">people think that the last two months</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">were that they want to see a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:06.390" style="s2">of themselves in me who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:08.099" style="s2">participate in it and so it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.390" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">because people are asking me like well</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">what was it like what&#39;s it like for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">but really I I think they really want me</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:17.660" style="s2">to ask them what it was like for</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">hmm you know cuz I didn&#39;t like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.660" end="00:02:23.900" style="s2">I didn&#39;t go through it and I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:26.990" style="s2">having to read a history of it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.900" end="00:02:28.880" style="s2">there&#39;s been these videos that have gone</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.990" end="00:02:31.280" style="s2">pretty viral of people sort of talking</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.880" end="00:02:35.090" style="s2">to their pre lockdown selves like how</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.280" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">would it be I saw one of those I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.090" end="00:02:41.150" style="s2">that&#39;s really insightful you are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:43.340" style="s2">the pre lockdown self although I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.150" end="00:02:44.900" style="s2">under lockdown you know it was voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.340" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">but I was under lockdown I just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.900" end="00:02:48.830" style="s2">have all the social media feeds and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:51.890" style="s2">news of the information coming at me but</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.830" end="00:02:54.710" style="s2">I knew I you know I the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.890" end="00:02:58.340" style="s2">that I think I posted an ironic tweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.710" end="00:03:00.620" style="s2">and and it was I&#39;m back from 75 days in</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.340" end="00:03:03.560" style="s2">silence did I miss anything and of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.620" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">course like I knew that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.560" end="00:03:08.780" style="s2">pandemic right so if obviously I I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:10.910" style="s2">obviously knew and you can actually look</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.780" end="00:03:13.460" style="s2">like three more tweets down in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.910" end="00:03:15.620" style="s2">timeline to see me asking about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.460" end="00:03:18.140" style="s2">impact the known impacts of kovat on</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.620" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">people of certain age ranges and how to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.140" end="00:03:21.950" style="s2">protect against it as the community so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.350" style="s2">there are now newsagent and so this has</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.950" end="00:03:26.810" style="s2">been really interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.350" end="00:03:30.710" style="s2">things get distorted by the news media</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.810" end="00:03:35.360" style="s2">right so there then portraying me as if</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.710" end="00:03:37.580" style="s2">I&#39;m this like I had no clue that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:40.430" style="s2">was happening I was just completely in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.580" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">the dark which is so clearly not true</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.430" end="00:03:46.040" style="s2">and you would just have to do an iota of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:49.220" style="s2">research to find that out you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.040" end="00:03:53.030" style="s2">but that&#39;s why I find the whole thing so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.220" end="00:03:54.470" style="s2">astonishing and is because and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.030" end="00:03:55.520" style="s2">think the New York Times are to have got</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.470" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">there and probably none of the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.520" end="00:03:59.500" style="s2">news piece has got there either is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:01.640" style="s2">because you&#39;d been going into</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.500" end="00:04:03.770" style="s2">existential risk you&#39;ve been doing a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.640" end="00:04:06.260" style="s2">real deep dive into exactly all of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.770" end="00:04:08.650" style="s2">topics that are now front and center of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.260" end="00:04:10.730" style="s2">everyone&#39;s mind which is what I find</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.650" end="00:04:12.709" style="s2">astonishing about this whole situations</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.730" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">you&#39;ve come out and also the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.709" end="00:04:16.940" style="s2">we talked about kind of you feeling that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:18.950" style="s2">you come to the end of that exploration</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.940" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">you were sort of like I can not sure</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.950" end="00:04:25.700" style="s2">where I go next with this yeah like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">deeper level of on some level you&#39;d gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:30.289" style="s2">as deeply as anyone I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.020" end="00:04:33.349" style="s2">into understanding the the sort of how</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.289" end="00:04:36.979" style="s2">how badly wrong our source code had gone</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.349" end="00:04:39.190" style="s2">and how fragile our society was I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.979" end="00:04:42.979" style="s2">that&#39;s what I I&#39;m really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.190" end="00:04:45.289" style="s2">was there a sense of recognition when</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.979" end="00:04:48.620" style="s2">you came out like her this is what I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.289" end="00:04:56.569" style="s2">maybe picking up towards the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.620" end="00:04:59.180" style="s2">exploration with the podcast recognition</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.569" end="00:05:09.159" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s something like I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.180" end="00:05:14.030" style="s2">surprised I wasn&#39;t surprised and I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.159" end="00:05:19.370" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say I felt vindicated but</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.030" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">I felt like more confident in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.370" end="00:05:24.620" style="s2">decisions I made about how I&#39;m living my</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:30.130" style="s2">life because I have I have intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.620" end="00:05:33.080" style="s2">chosen to live in a way that I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.130" end="00:05:34.789" style="s2">takes into account as you say the kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.080" end="00:05:38.000" style="s2">of buggy source code of our planetary</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.789" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2">system and so because I live in that way</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.000" end="00:05:42.409" style="s2">this actually the whole pandemic whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">or not I was in solitary retreat</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.409" end="00:05:47.870" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have been as massive and impact</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:49.849" style="s2">because I live in community you know we</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.870" end="00:05:54.620" style="s2">cook for each other we entertain each</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.849" end="00:05:58.219" style="s2">other we cut each other&#39;s hair you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.620" end="00:06:02.349" style="s2">and so I wouldn&#39;t have been isolated in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.219" end="00:06:05.389" style="s2">the way that so many folks were and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.349" end="00:06:07.190" style="s2">furthermore I wouldn&#39;t have I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.389" end="00:06:11.840" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have lost my job all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.190" end="00:06:14.240" style="s2">things would have been sort of I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.840" end="00:06:16.759" style="s2">already lost my job I&#39;ve already lost my</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.240" end="00:06:18.650" style="s2">life I&#39;ve already walked down the hill</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.759" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">of collapse to a large degree my life is</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.650" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">incredibly simple and so you know as</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:28.219" style="s2">people begin to grieve the loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.219" end="00:06:34.849" style="s2">they thought they could depend on I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:36.479" style="s2">done that I&#39;ve been doing that for years</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.849" end="00:06:44.770" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.479" end="00:06:48.009" style="s2">so like I feel kind of business as usual</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.770" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing to to watch the planet go</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.009" end="00:06:55.810" style="s2">through this and to be here for it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:57.490" style="s2">it&#39;s not surprising and what when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.810" end="00:07:01.509" style="s2">save the planet go through this what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.490" end="00:07:11.010" style="s2">your frame yeah my model is just that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.509" end="00:07:13.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a phase shift systems collapse a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.010" end="00:07:17.080" style="s2">movement into a time between worlds as</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:22.090" style="s2">Zack Stein puts it and that there&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.080" end="00:07:24.910" style="s2">an acceleration of that seemingly due to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.090" end="00:07:27.550" style="s2">the pandemic and second and third order</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.910" end="00:07:31.320" style="s2">effects from that and then those weaving</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.550" end="00:07:34.690" style="s2">back into the complicated complex system</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.320" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">so I mean so that&#39;s what it is is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.690" end="00:07:39.690" style="s2">dissolution it&#39;s a dissolution it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:45.310" style="s2">revealing as you say it&#39;s an apocalypse</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.690" end="00:07:48.610" style="s2">and I think that can be quite beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.310" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">or it can be horrible depends on how we</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.610" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">participate with it and whether we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.010" end="00:07:55.599" style="s2">been lying to ourselves up until this</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.979" style="s2">point or how much we&#39;ve been lying to</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.979" end="00:08:00.580" style="s2">have exactly we&#39;ve all been lying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.330" end="00:08:02.740" style="s2">ourselves to some degree indeed indeed</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.580" end="00:08:04.419" style="s2">yeah thank you I think I think let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.740" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">recap the word apocalypse because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.419" end="00:08:08.139" style="s2">think we talked about it before we</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:10.810" style="s2">started recording and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.139" end="00:08:15.520" style="s2">Jamie wheal that Delia nated those three</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.520" end="00:08:18.820" style="s2">remember the last one but it&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.440" end="00:08:20.919" style="s2">come to me and he talked about</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.820" end="00:08:24.580" style="s2">apocalypse being at the unveiling and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.919" end="00:08:26.260" style="s2">that feels very relevant in the context</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.580" end="00:08:28.449" style="s2">of the lockdown in the context of Kovach</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.260" end="00:08:30.370" style="s2">because it seems to be revealing all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.449" end="00:08:33.219" style="s2">the stress points of the cultures and</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.050" end="00:08:48.040" style="s2">going to become more and more like I</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.029" end="00:08:49.089" style="s2">think you probably share a similar sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.040" end="00:08:49.500" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually only at the</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.500" end="00:08:57.240" style="s2">of this yeah process rather than yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.620" end="00:09:00.980" style="s2">whatever happens this was a shock to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.240" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">system that is now seemingly unraveling</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.980" end="00:09:10.230" style="s2">moment by moment and is going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">continue to do so yeah yeah yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.230" end="00:09:15.330" style="s2">the way that I&#39;ve lived in response to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:17.670" style="s2">that is to try to extract myself as much</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.330" end="00:09:22.140" style="s2">as I can from the system so that as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.670" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">gets shocked and unravels I don&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.140" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t destroy me I voluntarily destroy</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:33.960" style="s2">myself so that it can&#39;t hurt me in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:35.850" style="s2">way that it could you know like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.960" end="00:09:38.130" style="s2">been doing these radio interviews and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.850" end="00:09:41.790" style="s2">and it&#39;s so weird how they work there</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.130" end="00:09:43.290" style="s2">five or ten minutes long and but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.790" end="00:09:45.480" style="s2">just process you you just kind of are</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.290" end="00:09:47.340" style="s2">like cattle you&#39;re just being put</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.480" end="00:09:49.590" style="s2">through this information harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.340" end="00:09:52.230" style="s2">machine the story harvesting machine and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.590" end="00:09:53.520" style="s2">um some of the some of the people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.230" end="00:09:56.040" style="s2">do it are very good at making you feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.520" end="00:10:01.410" style="s2">comfortable but I know that you really</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.040" end="00:10:03.420" style="s2">care because I know you and it feels and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.410" end="00:10:05.160" style="s2">and but in going through that process</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.420" end="00:10:06.780" style="s2">with all these like news stories I start</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.160" end="00:10:08.460" style="s2">to like lose track of who I am or I</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.780" end="00:10:10.440" style="s2">start to lose track of my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.460" end="00:10:12.600" style="s2">because I know that I know that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.440" end="00:10:14.970" style="s2">want something in particular like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.600" end="00:10:16.260" style="s2">New York Times article we talked about a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.970" end="00:10:18.720" style="s2">lot of different stuff we talked for</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.260" end="00:10:21.050" style="s2">over three hours I talked for over three</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.720" end="00:10:24.900" style="s2">hours with Ellen the journalist and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.050" end="00:10:26.250" style="s2">knew before that process started I knew</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.900" end="00:10:29.150" style="s2">during I knew after there was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.250" end="00:10:32.670" style="s2">particular story that she had in mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.150" end="00:10:36.870" style="s2">and it wasn&#39;t about why you would do a</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.670" end="00:10:38.250" style="s2">solitary retreat or what maple is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.870" end="00:10:40.350" style="s2">the monastic Academy is and what it</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.250" end="00:10:42.060" style="s2">stands for what I was trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.350" end="00:10:47.870" style="s2">you know it was a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.060" end="00:10:52.140" style="s2">story that she wanted and I appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.870" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">being in a space where like I can kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.140" end="00:10:57.880" style="s2">of just speak what&#39;s true for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:11:02.080" style="s2">instead of having to deal with what I X</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.880" end="00:11:03.580" style="s2">what I think that you want me to say mmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.080" end="00:11:05.500" style="s2">which i think is really common in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.580" end="00:11:09.070" style="s2">media in the mainstream media sphere now</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.500" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">I know yeah and also there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.070" end="00:11:13.180" style="s2">thing that the more that you tell the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.370" style="s2">story if you&#39;re telling it to like 10</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.180" end="00:11:17.050" style="s2">different media outlets you get to learn</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.370" end="00:11:18.760" style="s2">pretty quickly what are the key bits</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.050" end="00:11:20.470" style="s2">that they want to hear and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.760" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">start early then you start delivering a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.470" end="00:11:25.750" style="s2">story that hits those particular yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:27.220" style="s2">yeah yeah you see it&#39;s like fractal</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.750" end="00:11:28.630" style="s2">metaprogramming right it just goes all</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.220" end="00:11:31.320" style="s2">the way down the stack so that I then</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.630" end="00:11:35.110" style="s2">become a tool of this kind of collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.320" end="00:11:39.130" style="s2">intelligence oh it&#39;s very weird and I I</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.110" end="00:11:41.170" style="s2">it&#39;s I don&#39;t know how people like get</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.130" end="00:11:43.180" style="s2">famous and then after they get actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.170" end="00:11:44.769" style="s2">famous they&#39;re like actually Fame is not</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.180" end="00:11:47.800" style="s2">really what I thought it would be like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.769" end="00:11:50.170" style="s2">having just a little bit of exposure now</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.800" end="00:11:51.550" style="s2">like just a very very very very tiny</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.170" end="00:11:56.769" style="s2">amount like being the New York Times and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.550" end="00:12:00.010" style="s2">talk it&#39;s not that it&#39;s not good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.769" end="00:12:05.700" style="s2">not conducive to happiness hmm it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.010" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">satisfying is that because of that and</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.700" end="00:12:10.779" style="s2">that process that you were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:13.089" style="s2">about like effectively yourself your</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.779" end="00:12:17.589" style="s2">story starts becoming externalized in</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.089" end="00:12:19.060" style="s2">some way yeah yeah you the more</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.589" end="00:12:21.100" style="s2">attention you&#39;re having on you the more</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.060" end="00:12:22.390" style="s2">kind of representations of your story</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.100" end="00:12:24.610" style="s2">that are being produced the more it</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.390" end="00:12:27.940" style="s2">starts to collapse the experience that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.610" end="00:12:29.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve had into a exactly narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.940" end="00:12:31.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not your narrative it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.440" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">narrative that the betrayal no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.810" end="00:12:38.829" style="s2">right exactly and it&#39;s fucked up and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:41.199" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s really messed up yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.829" end="00:12:43.149" style="s2">think that&#39;s exactly well set yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.199" end="00:12:44.529" style="s2">said I&#39;ve never really considered it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.149" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">like that but just hearing your</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.529" end="00:12:50.079" style="s2">description of it really fits like in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:52.449" style="s2">way wow that there&#39;s also this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.079" end="00:12:53.890" style="s2">sense of you know the is it Native</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.449" end="00:12:56.649" style="s2">Americans who believe that if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.649" end="00:13:03.010" style="s2">was captured yeah there&#39;s something true</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.010" end="00:13:07.880" style="s2">well sir I i sat my retreat for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.740" end="00:13:10.250" style="s2">exact same duration as my friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:11.840" style="s2">time was my friend Peter Park who lives</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.250" end="00:13:14.390" style="s2">here at the monastery with me a</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.840" end="00:13:16.730" style="s2">wonderful human being and obviously he</p>

<p begin="00:13:23.330" end="00:13:32.210" style="s2">and I think he&#39;s happier and I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">that his retreat is more sacred its</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.210" end="00:13:39.110" style="s2">maintaining its sacredness relative to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:42.050" style="s2">me there it&#39;s being held sacrosanct it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.110" end="00:13:45.290" style="s2">being protected in a way that mine now</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.050" end="00:13:47.600" style="s2">is out of my hands in a very confusing</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.290" end="00:13:49.280" style="s2">way perhaps unlike anybody who&#39;s ever</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.410" end="00:14:12.140" style="s2">might have had the most newsworthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.700" end="00:14:16.460" style="s2">silent retreat that there have been yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.140" end="00:14:22.760" style="s2">yeah yeah which probably just shows us</p>

<p begin="00:14:22.760" end="00:14:25.460" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re right that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.930" end="00:14:27.220" style="s2">actually a reflection of ourselves that</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:38.540" style="s2">haven&#39;t really asked how it was for you</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.370" end="00:14:42.440" style="s2">they&#39;re not really interested in for</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:43.640" style="s2">that no I don&#39;t think I want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.440" end="00:14:44.810" style="s2">say you&#39;ve had a few of these different</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.640" end="00:14:47.090" style="s2">interviews what is the story that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.810" end="00:14:48.650" style="s2">want to tell you yeah I mean so the that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.090" end="00:14:51.350" style="s2">I&#39;m like Rip Van Winkle and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.650" end="00:14:53.810" style="s2">emerging into this completely changed</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.350" end="00:14:58.670" style="s2">world and they want me to tell them how</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.810" end="00:15:01.400" style="s2">I see the change they want me to tell</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.670" end="00:15:04.100" style="s2">them what&#39;s been surprising about how</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.400" end="00:15:08.450" style="s2">the world has changed so they want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.100" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">they want me to acknowledge I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.450" end="00:15:14.620" style="s2">is what they went through or what what</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:14.620" style="s2">shifts have taken place</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.790" end="00:15:18.710" style="s2">probably in order to further consolidate</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:21.300" style="s2">their vision of this being a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.710" end="00:15:24.180" style="s2">significant time in history I really</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.300" end="00:15:28.500" style="s2">like monumental epic oh yeah like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.180" end="00:15:29.940" style="s2">know epic shifting event it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.500" end="00:15:32.250" style="s2">imagination but I haven&#39;t haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.940" end="00:15:35.190" style="s2">thought about it too deeply yet and and</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.250" end="00:15:40.380" style="s2">do they know that your entire work</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.190" end="00:15:43.560" style="s2">before now was effectively saying that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.380" end="00:15:49.530" style="s2">there will be local world-changing event</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.560" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">collapse unclear Laurie that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.530" end="00:15:53.490" style="s2">the paradox as well is that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">people are like oh wow there&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.490" end="00:15:56.790" style="s2">good story here and they&#39;re pushing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:15:59.130" style="s2">into a narrative that they understand</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.790" end="00:16:02.400" style="s2">and they think their viewers want but</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.130" end="00:16:07.290" style="s2">actually the story itself is so much</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.400" end="00:16:09.630" style="s2">more interesting than that here&#39;s a guy</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.290" end="00:16:11.370" style="s2">who&#39;s gone as deeply as anyone into</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.630" end="00:16:16.170" style="s2">understanding collapse and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.370" end="00:16:19.110" style="s2">system dynamics and kind of effectively</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.170" end="00:16:21.060" style="s2">came to the end of that inquiry I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.110" end="00:16:22.650" style="s2">sure what happens next and I that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.060" end="00:16:24.210" style="s2">I find extraordinary as well as that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.650" end="00:16:26.820" style="s2">was picking up something similar I</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.210" end="00:16:29.490" style="s2">remember we talked I think was last year</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.820" end="00:16:31.230" style="s2">at the emerge gathering and you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.490" end="00:16:33.660" style="s2">sort of feeling the end of that inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.230" end="00:16:36.470" style="s2">and I kind of I wasn&#39;t quite there but</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.660" end="00:16:38.460" style="s2">then I had a series of experiences</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.470" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">certainly towards the beginning of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.460" end="00:16:44.730" style="s2">year where I felt something similar he</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:46.740" style="s2">met with Eric Weinstein who said almost</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.730" end="00:16:48.390" style="s2">exactly the same thing he kind of was</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.740" end="00:16:51.000" style="s2">looking around and saying I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.390" end="00:16:54.900" style="s2">the system has crystallized and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.000" end="00:16:56.910" style="s2">effectively dead and I was like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.900" end="00:16:58.410" style="s2">that feels right of the inquiry that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.910" end="00:17:00.330" style="s2">rebel wisdom has been on since the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.410" end="00:17:01.950" style="s2">beginning and in Corey that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.330" end="00:17:04.470" style="s2">on this sort of sense of what&#39;s new and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.950" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">emerging and sensing actually I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.470" end="00:17:08.670" style="s2">sure what it is I mean something else is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:09.930" style="s2">gonna happen and then the pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.670" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">the sort of second and third-order</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.930" end="00:17:17.250" style="s2">consequence so like okay that was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.360" end="00:17:18.660" style="s2">thing that was that was coming mmm do</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.250" end="00:17:22.070" style="s2">you feel like your inquiry has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.660" end="00:17:27.900" style="s2">revitalized by kovaydin value well yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.070" end="00:17:28.199" style="s2">yeah very much so like this is in a sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.900" end="00:17:29.789" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.199" end="00:17:32.279" style="s2">clichéd these are the times that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.789" end="00:17:36.720" style="s2">been waiting for kind of kind of way</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.279" end="00:17:38.610" style="s2">yeah and also yeah feeling really like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.720" end="00:17:43.080" style="s2">feel like and maybe you feel the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.610" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">with with emerge I feel like the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.080" end="00:17:48.570" style="s2">films that we put out over the last two</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:49.950" style="s2">or three years on rebel wisdom all of so</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.570" end="00:17:51.570" style="s2">much of what&#39;s happening now within</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.950" end="00:17:53.820" style="s2">those films like I want to just go</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.570" end="00:17:55.559" style="s2">through the back catalogue and grab all</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.820" end="00:17:57.960" style="s2">of these kind of amazing because</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.559" end="00:18:00.090" style="s2">effectively saying okay these are the</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.960" end="00:18:01.889" style="s2">deep forces that are at work the Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.090" end="00:18:06.179" style="s2">rules the daniel trachtenberg is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.889" end="00:18:07.470" style="s2">nora Bateson&#39;s and say look we this was</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.179" end="00:18:11.100" style="s2">going something like this was going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.470" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">happen and this is likely to only be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.100" end="00:18:16.950" style="s2">beginning of this process because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:18.090" style="s2">something we&#39;ve done a series of events</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.950" end="00:18:20.970" style="s2">since the beginning of the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.090" end="00:18:23.700" style="s2">about resilience and sense making sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.970" end="00:18:25.350" style="s2">making is a form of resilience oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.700" end="00:18:27.029" style="s2">why if something is happening being able</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.350" end="00:18:29.159" style="s2">to understand okay what are the tectonic</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.029" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">plates that our ship is not being</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.159" end="00:18:33.630" style="s2">overwhelmed by the by the impact of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:37.620" style="s2">what&#39;s going on it&#39;s such a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.630" end="00:18:39.690" style="s2">thing yeah and in the rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.620" end="00:18:42.000" style="s2">community in amongst our members I</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.690" end="00:18:44.340" style="s2">remember the very first zoom call that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.000" end="00:18:47.659" style="s2">we had after after the pandemic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.340" end="00:18:52.220" style="s2">really kicked in most people on the call</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.659" end="00:18:54.299" style="s2">not all but most were actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.220" end="00:18:56.970" style="s2">breathing kind of sigh of relief it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.299" end="00:18:59.460" style="s2">like and yes I know what&#39;s going on I</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.970" end="00:19:06.710" style="s2">feel that I&#39;m waiting for something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.460" end="00:19:10.230" style="s2">this Wow huh yeah I&#39;ve actually heard</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.710" end="00:19:11.549" style="s2">the the sense of what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.230" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">echoed by a lot of folks that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.549" end="00:19:15.029" style="s2">spoken with since I&#39;ve left retreat you</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:19.789" style="s2">know you know that are in our kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.029" end="00:19:19.789" style="s2">extended network that they feel like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.350" end="00:19:24.900" style="s2">yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.160" end="00:19:27.270" style="s2">what we&#39;ve been training for in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.900" end="00:19:31.890" style="s2">this is what we&#39;ve been preparing for</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.270" end="00:19:34.050" style="s2">that we&#39;re kind of now is the time to</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.890" end="00:19:38.340" style="s2">show up in a way that we&#39;ve been saying</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.050" end="00:19:39.180" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna need to show up in yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.340" end="00:19:40.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t want it to get to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.180" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">self-congratulatory because I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.830" end="00:19:49.830" style="s2">there are things that we also need to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:52.770" style="s2">as a community to read I think wow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.830" end="00:19:54.360" style="s2">yeah no go back to crying I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.770" end="00:19:58.470" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s another conversation but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.360" end="00:20:03.020" style="s2">feel I feel that just more generally I</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.470" end="00:20:05.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think I don&#39;t think we have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.020" end="00:20:08.370" style="s2">the structures or the coherence to</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.720" end="00:20:10.550" style="s2">respond as meaningfully as I think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.370" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">should or as we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.550" end="00:20:14.760" style="s2">yeah and that was actually my sense when</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:16.260" style="s2">I heard people say this it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.760" end="00:20:20.910" style="s2">oh interesting so the echo chamber is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.260" end="00:20:27.090" style="s2">still alive hmm and maybe even more more</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.910" end="00:20:34.530" style="s2">echo II might might I mean so what two</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.090" end="00:20:36.210" style="s2">things that come up for me one is one of</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.530" end="00:20:38.750" style="s2">the impacts of I think both my retreat</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.210" end="00:20:43.980" style="s2">and coming to the end of this inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.750" end="00:20:45.690" style="s2">have been something that Zack Stein said</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.980" end="00:20:51.150" style="s2">in one of our last conversations he said</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.690" end="00:20:52.620" style="s2">you know game a game B that&#39;s all fine</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.150" end="00:20:56.310" style="s2">but the real game is the people you</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.620" end="00:20:59.300" style="s2">spend time with the real game is who you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.310" end="00:21:01.590" style="s2">live with and how you treat them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.300" end="00:21:03.300" style="s2">something about the end of this inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.590" end="00:21:05.640" style="s2">has just left me in that place where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.300" end="00:21:07.830" style="s2">just like oh great so I&#39;ve had all these</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.640" end="00:21:09.540" style="s2">philosophical conversations that have</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.830" end="00:21:11.790" style="s2">like seriously reordered my</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.540" end="00:21:14.220" style="s2">consciousness and my the way I see</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.790" end="00:21:15.570" style="s2">things how does that actually help me</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.220" end="00:21:18.540" style="s2">love the people I&#39;m with how does that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.570" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">actually help me move in the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.540" end="00:21:23.550" style="s2">way that I can be proud of actually does</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:25.230" style="s2">it and for me going forward I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.550" end="00:21:29.660" style="s2">really has to be the litmus test like</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.230" end="00:21:32.040" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m not willing to have</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.660" end="00:21:33.720" style="s2">conversations that are actually abstract</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.040" end="00:21:36.179" style="s2">to the point where they don&#39;t impact</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.720" end="00:21:40.350" style="s2">that directly</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.179" end="00:21:44.429" style="s2">and and what&#39;s interesting is that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.350" end="00:21:47.070" style="s2">think those conversations actually can</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.429" end="00:21:49.409" style="s2">look quite abstract the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.070" end="00:21:53.789" style="s2">that help us love because so much of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.409" end="00:21:57.320" style="s2">what keeps us that prevents us from</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.789" end="00:22:00.299" style="s2">loving is the kind of philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:02.700" style="s2">ontological and epistemological systems</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.299" end="00:22:06.119" style="s2">that we naively participate in like</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.700" end="00:22:09.809" style="s2">materialism and humanism and liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.119" end="00:22:10.980" style="s2">and so it&#39;s so it&#39;s a funny position of</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.809" end="00:22:12.659" style="s2">being because even as I&#39;ve been on these</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.980" end="00:22:14.549" style="s2">radio shows they introduced me often as</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.659" end="00:22:16.129" style="s2">a full as an online philosopher which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.549" end="00:22:19.169" style="s2">the worst</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.129" end="00:22:20.970" style="s2">title I think that you could be but are</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.169" end="00:22:23.429" style="s2">the most easily characterized title I</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.970" end="00:22:29.549" style="s2">think you could be given easily</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.429" end="00:22:31.110" style="s2">satirized yeah exactly and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.549" end="00:22:32.490" style="s2">these conversations seem very</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.110" end="00:22:36.389" style="s2">philosophical but I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.490" end="00:22:37.889" style="s2">actually more eminent than just about</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.389" end="00:22:39.590" style="s2">anything else we can talk about because</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.889" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">they are the lens through which we view</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.590" end="00:22:45.450" style="s2">everything else we could talk about and</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:48.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s one of the things that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.450" end="00:22:50.419" style="s2">most interested is I think that just</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.240" end="00:22:53.580" style="s2">like there&#39;s an opportunity now to build</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.419" end="00:22:55.259" style="s2">kind of new social structures and new</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.580" end="00:23:00.960" style="s2">information since making structures</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.259" end="00:23:06.509" style="s2">there&#39;s also an opportunity to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.960" end="00:23:09.119" style="s2">the cosmos to break out of materialism</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.509" end="00:23:10.950" style="s2">to break out of humanism and find</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.119" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">ourselves again in a world that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.950" end="00:23:15.990" style="s2">sold that it&#39;s meaningful and it calls</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:19.799" style="s2">us forth into a sense of divine duty and</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.990" end="00:23:20.940" style="s2">that is necessary I think if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.799" end="00:23:22.470" style="s2">actually gonna thread the eye of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.940" end="00:23:23.759" style="s2">needle in the years to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.470" end="00:23:25.919" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not even I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.759" end="00:23:28.009" style="s2">think it&#39;s even worth doing it if we</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.919" end="00:23:31.619" style="s2">can&#39;t really can that or awaken that</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.009" end="00:23:34.019" style="s2">sense that meaningful message sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.619" end="00:23:36.869" style="s2">you documented that journey with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.019" end="00:23:40.470" style="s2">emerge podcast and you really you you</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.869" end="00:23:42.059" style="s2">made a live exploration and recorded</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.470" end="00:23:46.529" style="s2">your your exploration to a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.059" end="00:23:48.090" style="s2">topics I guess one of the things is if</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.529" end="00:23:49.950" style="s2">people want to kind of retrace your</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.090" end="00:23:52.139" style="s2">steps which one which</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.950" end="00:23:58.139" style="s2">particular conversations would you</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.139" end="00:24:02.120" style="s2">suggest they listen to yeah I probably I</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.139" end="00:24:04.649" style="s2">would recommend the three conversations</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.120" end="00:24:09.510" style="s2">djembe and L who wrote the deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.649" end="00:24:11.190" style="s2">adaptation paper Vinay Gupta who well</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.510" end="00:24:13.529" style="s2">this is Vinay Gupta you have to listen</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.190" end="00:24:15.149" style="s2">to it and then sorry you for all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.529" end="00:24:20.190" style="s2">most recent conversation that gives the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.149" end="00:24:24.000" style="s2">kind of arc where I was reckoning</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.190" end="00:24:27.419" style="s2">finally completely with the basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.000" end="00:24:30.380" style="s2">becoming convinced having attained to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.419" end="00:24:33.899" style="s2">the conviction about collapse and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:36.210" style="s2">deciding to move back to maple to accord</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.899" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">with that conviction and then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.210" end="00:24:42.690" style="s2">conversation with soryu I think places</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:45.269" style="s2">the aspiration for awakening spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.690" end="00:24:48.179" style="s2">enlightenment in in light of and in</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.269" end="00:24:51.149" style="s2">terms of this what time it is on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.179" end="00:24:51.510" style="s2">planet and so that I think gives it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.149" end="00:24:54.600" style="s2">Kenneth</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.510" end="00:24:59.429" style="s2">nice nutshell of my my recent journey</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.600" end="00:25:01.230" style="s2">yeah yeah and I guess my we actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.429" end="00:25:03.960" style="s2">recorded a conversation about collapse</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.230" end="00:25:08.190" style="s2">you have you me and Josh fields oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.960" end="00:25:11.059" style="s2">and in that I think I for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.190" end="00:25:13.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve I&#39;ve got sort of one foot in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.059" end="00:25:14.909" style="s2">Jordan Pederson camp in particular like</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.529" end="00:25:18.149" style="s2">wearing one of the best times to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.909" end="00:25:20.039" style="s2">alive we we shouldn&#39;t be we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.149" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">grateful for the miracle of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.039" end="00:25:26.070" style="s2">and holding that peace alongside a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:27.539" style="s2">of the most brilliant people I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.070" end="00:25:30.299" style="s2">speaking to talking about self</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.539" end="00:25:32.039" style="s2">terminating systems and being persuaded</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.299" end="00:25:34.110" style="s2">by that at the same time but not I never</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.039" end="00:25:38.070" style="s2">went into it as fully as you did or</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.110" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">maybe Josh did and my my sense was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.070" end="00:25:42.690" style="s2">holding all of these different pieces</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:44.639" style="s2">but at the beginning of the pandemic for</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.690" end="00:25:47.639" style="s2">me that possibility space really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.639" end="00:25:50.399" style="s2">collapse down to ok the systems thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.639" end="00:25:53.580" style="s2">and the the collapse ologists I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.399" end="00:25:55.769" style="s2">they as you saw this start to cascade</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.580" end="00:25:58.049" style="s2">you saw all the fragilities become clear</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.769" end="00:25:59.549" style="s2">for me it kind of closing yeah all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.049" end="00:26:01.110" style="s2">these impossibilities it really started</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.549" end="00:26:02.809" style="s2">to close the space in terms of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.110" end="00:26:07.059" style="s2">really going on and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.809" end="00:26:10.090" style="s2">who was sort of seeing who had the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.059" end="00:26:13.429" style="s2">complete vision of what the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.090" end="00:26:16.039" style="s2">societal fragilities were so that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.429" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">of my my journey whether it was like oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.039" end="00:26:20.210" style="s2">actually now okay I I feel like I feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:21.649" style="s2">like I held a lot of those</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.210" end="00:26:23.210" style="s2">impossibilities and now it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.649" end="00:26:27.620" style="s2">become a little bit more clear as to</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.210" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">which one was true and which one wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.620" end="00:26:32.740" style="s2">and specifically it was the systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:35.600" style="s2">theorists and the people who were really</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.740" end="00:26:38.840" style="s2">talking about systems for jodean</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.600" end="00:26:44.090" style="s2">collapse but you felt we&#39;re more yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.840" end="00:26:46.039" style="s2">yeah yeah and and the also the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.090" end="00:26:47.929" style="s2">nature of a self terminating system</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.039" end="00:26:50.059" style="s2">especially just looking at the bit that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.929" end="00:26:52.789" style="s2">I&#39;m primarily focused on which is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.059" end="00:26:55.820" style="s2">the sense making system and conveying</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.789" end="00:26:58.070" style="s2">how even that even happened was then</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.820" end="00:27:00.669" style="s2">dragged into this sort of polarization</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.070" end="00:27:03.320" style="s2">spiral of how do we know what is true</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.669" end="00:27:06.619" style="s2">everything being weaponized from health</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.320" end="00:27:09.350" style="s2">advice to kind of alternative narratives</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.619" end="00:27:11.809" style="s2">to just just realizing oh my god we have</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.350" end="00:27:14.299" style="s2">no way of determining what is true we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.809" end="00:27:16.429" style="s2">having all of these all of these factors</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.299" end="00:27:18.950" style="s2">that we&#39;d kind of were aware of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.429" end="00:27:21.019" style="s2">of how sticky something is how much it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.950" end="00:27:24.049" style="s2">sort of reliant on outrage and limbic</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.019" end="00:27:26.690" style="s2">hijack and all of those kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.049" end="00:27:29.330" style="s2">ecosystem of social media and and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.690" end="00:27:31.669" style="s2">realizing wow even-even Cove it is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.330" end="00:27:34.009" style="s2">becoming a culture war issue told that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.669" end="00:27:36.860" style="s2">look that for me is oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.009" end="00:27:38.179" style="s2">was was something I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.860" end="00:27:42.169" style="s2">expect because that didn&#39;t really happen</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.179" end="00:27:45.529" style="s2">in the UK so much the UK generally the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.169" end="00:27:47.299" style="s2">centre has held to some to a much</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.529" end="00:27:50.409" style="s2">greater degree than it has in the States</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.299" end="00:27:52.759" style="s2">I mean Europe I&#39;d say to so to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.409" end="00:27:54.679" style="s2">you can argue that that may have changed</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.759" end="00:27:57.830" style="s2">into a different like I think we may be</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.679" end="00:28:00.710" style="s2">in a different space now with the with</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.830" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">the riots and with the these other kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.710" end="00:28:04.129" style="s2">of narratives that are now kind of going</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:07.730" style="s2">to war with each other but that feels</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.129" end="00:28:12.309" style="s2">like a significant shift from where we</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.730" end="00:28:15.379" style="s2">were before but I guess that yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.309" end="00:28:16.290" style="s2">yeah and I think I&#39;ve been you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.379" end="00:28:19.620" style="s2">slowly</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.290" end="00:28:23.520" style="s2">chin up and it&#39;s been interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.620" end="00:28:26.160" style="s2">watch myself try to make sense of how of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.520" end="00:28:30.840" style="s2">all this and who I turned towards right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.160" end="00:28:38.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s primarily Daniel Shakti Berger</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.840" end="00:28:41.370" style="s2">Jordan Hall nor Bateson and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.550" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">that I hear especially Jordan and Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.370" end="00:28:50.510" style="s2">warning about is you know Daniel I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:54.330" style="s2">said only 1% of warfare is kinetic and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.510" end="00:28:57.870" style="s2">just really seeing I think if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.330" end="00:29:04.040" style="s2">one one thing coming out of retreat that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.870" end="00:29:06.540" style="s2">became clear to me was just how much our</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.040" end="00:29:08.280" style="s2">way of seeing the world is colored by</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.540" end="00:29:11.100" style="s2">the information ecosystem we participate</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.280" end="00:29:12.590" style="s2">in like as soon as I I went back in it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.100" end="00:29:15.690" style="s2">was like I was in a different world</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.590" end="00:29:21.210" style="s2">I just like all of a sudden poof I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.690" end="00:29:23.640" style="s2">a world of cultural warfare and you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.210" end="00:29:29.040" style="s2">various kinds of memetic conflicts and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.640" end="00:29:31.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like that&#39;s not real but I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.040" end="00:29:33.510" style="s2">it&#39;s really important that we both</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.890" end="00:29:37.260" style="s2">realize that that&#39;s not real and that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.510" end="00:29:40.400" style="s2">can periodically relieve ourselves from</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.260" end="00:29:44.160" style="s2">having to participate in it completely I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.400" end="00:29:46.800" style="s2">think one of the things that I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.160" end="00:29:48.420" style="s2">looking at in my retreat was that this</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.800" end="00:29:50.370" style="s2">you know one of the fundamental like</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.420" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">laws of consciousness is what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.370" end="00:29:55.320" style="s2">attuned to in your perception gets</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:57.630" style="s2">amplified regardless of what it is right</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.320" end="00:30:00.780" style="s2">so if you if you have pain in your leg</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.630" end="00:30:04.350" style="s2">and your attention just falls into that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.780" end="00:30:06.270" style="s2">your whole world can become pain if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.350" end="00:30:08.010" style="s2">have pleasure well-being arising in your</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.270" end="00:30:09.660" style="s2">body and you learn how to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.010" end="00:30:13.400" style="s2">to that skillfully your whole world can</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.660" end="00:30:16.800" style="s2">become pleasure and well-being and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.400" end="00:30:19.830" style="s2">coming out of retreat I just felt a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.800" end="00:30:22.770" style="s2">more careful about what I allow to</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.830" end="00:30:24.270" style="s2">occupy my attention in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.770" end="00:30:28.230" style="s2">world that it will then create for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.270" end="00:30:32.010" style="s2">that I will then you know spread</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.230" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">to others in my network and in my world</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.010" end="00:30:41.549" style="s2">and so I appreciate Daniel in particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:45.539" style="s2">his caution around this just going his</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.549" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">invitation just go slowly don&#39;t collapse</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.539" end="00:30:51.960" style="s2">into a perspective yet like we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:31:01.260" style="s2">liminal space and it&#39;s appropriate to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.960" end="00:31:04.590" style="s2">liminal yeah yeah likewise I think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.260" end="00:31:09.720" style="s2">all yea daniel has a real uncanny skill</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.590" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">to be able to speak to he&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.720" end="00:31:15.630" style="s2">speak without activating anyone immune</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:17.610" style="s2">anyone&#39;s immune system yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.630" end="00:31:19.500" style="s2">which is what I&#39;m kind of realizing is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.610" end="00:31:22.409" style="s2">actually the most the most important</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.500" end="00:31:25.529" style="s2">thing well is to not activate the immune</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.409" end="00:31:27.029" style="s2">system of either right or left yeah long</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.529" end="00:31:28.620" style="s2">enough that people can actually hear</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.029" end="00:31:36.059" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to say rather than</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.620" end="00:31:38.279" style="s2">immediately collapse into this this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.059" end="00:31:40.860" style="s2">the this is the primary thing is that in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.279" end="00:31:41.730" style="s2">every single area now it&#39;s like which</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.860" end="00:31:45.090" style="s2">side are you on</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.730" end="00:31:46.950" style="s2">and yeah not interested in oh my god in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.090" end="00:31:48.899" style="s2">anything beyond that just like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.950" end="00:31:49.649" style="s2">waiting for you to signal which side</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.899" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.649" end="00:31:54.510" style="s2">whether that&#39;s and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:56.580" style="s2">topics and they&#39;re so mean totally this</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.510" end="00:31:59.220" style="s2">is why it was it was so scary to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.580" end="00:32:01.919" style="s2">the New York Times coming out of retreat</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.220" end="00:32:03.299" style="s2">cuz I had no III knew that the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.919" end="00:32:04.679" style="s2">battlegrounds had shifted because of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.299" end="00:32:06.659" style="s2">kovat and that there are things that I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.679" end="00:32:08.850" style="s2">you know wasn&#39;t supposed to say and</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.659" end="00:32:11.010" style="s2">things that I like was supposed to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.850" end="00:32:15.630" style="s2">according to certain ideologies but I</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.010" end="00:32:19.950" style="s2">had no idea what it was right so I found</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.630" end="00:32:21.529" style="s2">myself being very cautious in the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.950" end="00:32:25.470" style="s2">that I expressed myself</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.529" end="00:32:28.110" style="s2">and it&#39;s like what you say like even</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.470" end="00:32:29.190" style="s2">coming out I noticed that I was like and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.110" end="00:32:31.139" style="s2">somebody would say something like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.190" end="00:32:32.639" style="s2">know the Republicans they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.139" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">trying to get us not to wear masks and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.639" end="00:32:36.929" style="s2">was like ok great so I now know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:39.419" style="s2">that is that ideological line it&#39;s drawn</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.929" end="00:32:40.830" style="s2">there very good there&#39;s some continuity</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.419" end="00:32:41.639" style="s2">that makes sense the Republicans would</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.830" end="00:32:44.070" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.639" end="00:32:46.889" style="s2">and then some liberals believe that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.070" end="00:32:50.190" style="s2">5-bit kovat is caused by 5g I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.889" end="00:32:54.149" style="s2">like what is happening here is even</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.190" end="00:32:56.219" style="s2">going on but you know yeah but but there</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.149" end="00:32:59.700" style="s2">are but there are paradoxes even within</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.219" end="00:33:02.279" style="s2">that which is on a classic kind of Big</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.700" end="00:33:05.129" style="s2">Five personality Republicans are more</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.279" end="00:33:06.959" style="s2">interested in sanctity like the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.129" end="00:33:09.869" style="s2">that it actually has become a signifier</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.959" end="00:33:12.539" style="s2">on the right to not care about covert or</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.869" end="00:33:14.609" style="s2">to be more in favor of lifting lock down</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.539" end="00:33:16.950" style="s2">is is interesting you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.609" end="00:33:20.820" style="s2">necessarily have expected that actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.950" end="00:33:23.459" style="s2">there&#39;s more there&#39;s more antipathy</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.820" end="00:33:25.889" style="s2">towards disease on the right than there</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.459" end="00:33:28.679" style="s2">is on the left like that&#39;s that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.889" end="00:33:30.509" style="s2">the kind of signifiers but it&#39;s mmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.679" end="00:33:32.579" style="s2">extraordinary like the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.509" end="00:33:34.859" style="s2">being shifted in in real time</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.579" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">totally and depending on what key</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.859" end="00:33:41.609" style="s2">figures say well yeah and so I I find</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">myself pretty ambivalent about about</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.609" end="00:33:46.169" style="s2">whether to and to what degree to try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:48.570" style="s2">piece it all together again</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.169" end="00:33:50.940" style="s2">I imagine I wouldn&#39;t have felt that way</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.570" end="00:33:52.679" style="s2">if I had been there through the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.940" end="00:33:53.940" style="s2">accelerating deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.679" end="00:33:55.259" style="s2">reconstruction like if I had been</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.940" end="00:33:57.269" style="s2">participating in it I probably would</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.259" end="00:34:03.539" style="s2">have felt more like included or</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.269" end="00:34:06.389" style="s2">something but I just I can&#39;t there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.539" end="00:34:09.960" style="s2">part of me that can&#39;t find a reason to</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.389" end="00:34:10.429" style="s2">care too much about it that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.960" end="00:34:14.039" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.429" end="00:34:20.490" style="s2">yeah I wonder I don&#39;t know it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.039" end="00:34:23.099" style="s2">question for me yeah I mean I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.490" end="00:34:32.069" style="s2">other question is how how was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.099" end="00:34:35.700" style="s2">retreat like 75 grade yeah retreat with</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.069" end="00:34:37.679" style="s2">meditation and yeah I mean it&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.700" end="00:34:41.389" style="s2">how nobody asked me about how their tree</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.679" end="00:34:46.440" style="s2">was you&#39;re one of the first people owned</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.389" end="00:34:50.700" style="s2">outside of my community here yeah so it</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.440" end="00:34:53.039" style="s2">was 75 days I was in silence in a cabin</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.700" end="00:34:55.290" style="s2">on the land here at the monastic Academy</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.039" end="00:34:58.080" style="s2">the captain has no electricity</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.290" end="00:35:00.000" style="s2">running water just propane heating and</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.080" end="00:35:02.400" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty small you know enough space</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.000" end="00:35:06.420" style="s2">for a bed a meditation cushion and like</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.400" end="00:35:09.240" style="s2">a yoga mat basically and I went in when</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.420" end="00:35:11.160" style="s2">the snow was you know up to my waist</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.240" end="00:35:14.220" style="s2">just about here in northern Vermont and</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.280" end="00:35:23.850" style="s2">that exciting it&#39;s kind of like a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.320" end="00:35:27.480" style="s2">boring version of the movie Groundhog</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.850" end="00:35:31.050" style="s2">Day I just got up meditated for two</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.630" end="00:36:26.760" style="s2">I know that it was the inner experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.600" end="00:36:28.170" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve ever done any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.760" end="00:36:30.770" style="s2">retreat like this it contained</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.170" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">everything or the whole spectrum of what</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.770" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">the human being I think is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">experiencing an intense grief</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.970" end="00:36:53.400" style="s2">unbelievable joy you know boredom kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.220" end="00:36:57.450" style="s2">of love hatred self-hatred freedom tons</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.400" end="00:37:03.710" style="s2">of suffering 75 days is a long time so</p>

<p begin="00:37:08.340" end="00:37:12.960" style="s2">called the jhanas like exploring the</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.230" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">genres which are states of basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.960" end="00:37:17.300" style="s2">altered states of states of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.300" style="s2">consciousness in the Buddhist tradition</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.660" end="00:37:23.100" style="s2">which I could explore more with you if</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting and then spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.100" end="00:37:28.710" style="s2">of time exploring the soul making Dharma</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:30.840" style="s2">which I&#39;ve talked about with the creator</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.710" end="00:37:32.370" style="s2">of it Rob for Bay on the show Robert</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.840" end="00:37:37.800" style="s2">they actually just passed away while I</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.370" end="00:37:39.660" style="s2">was on retreat and so yeah that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.800" end="00:37:42.540" style="s2">spent most of my time doing and of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.660" end="00:37:46.230" style="s2">course inevitably you think about things</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.540" end="00:37:49.680" style="s2">and you deal with what comes up and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.230" end="00:37:52.980" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredibly rich experience and</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.680" end="00:37:54.840" style="s2">it&#39;s also kind of ineffable I imagine in</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.980" end="00:37:57.660" style="s2">the same way that a lot of folks</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.840" end="00:37:59.430" style="s2">experiences quarantine and lockdown is</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.660" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">you know you can kind of say like what</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.430" end="00:38:06.990" style="s2">it is that you did but the the psychic</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:11.670" style="s2">territory that you move through is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.990" end="00:38:18.060" style="s2">intimate that you really can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.670" end="00:38:23.640" style="s2">about it at least not adequately and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.060" end="00:38:28.410" style="s2">I and so yeah it&#39;s like that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.640" end="00:38:34.620" style="s2">that yeah oh you also managed somehow to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.410" end="00:38:36.780" style="s2">get covered while you were so it one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.620" end="00:38:38.610" style="s2">the people who came to the last retreat</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.780" end="00:38:40.710" style="s2">before we kind of were gonna we walked</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.610" end="00:38:43.350" style="s2">down the center for the center was</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.710" end="00:38:46.050" style="s2">locked down I think they came from</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.350" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">Boston and this was you know early March</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.050" end="00:38:55.460" style="s2">so before shit had really hit the fan I</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:58.500" style="s2">think they brought it and it just spread</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.460" end="00:39:01.800" style="s2">like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen around this</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.500" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">community I think almost everybody got</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:08.300" style="s2">it and then about a week and a half or</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.050" end="00:39:08.300" style="s2">two weeks later I got it somehow yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.630" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s cool I could I could because I was</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.190" end="00:39:16.019" style="s2">meditating I could watch it like from</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:18.779" style="s2">from birth to death very closely and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.019" end="00:39:21.960" style="s2">said see what it did to my body and also</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.779" end="00:39:24.119" style="s2">see what my mind tried to do with it hmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.960" end="00:39:26.730" style="s2">at the end of this process if you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.119" end="00:39:32.430" style="s2">any insight or thoughts into what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.730" end="00:39:35.789" style="s2">want to do with emerge you&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.430" end="00:39:38.039" style="s2">called to to make any more podcasts or</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.789" end="00:39:39.990" style="s2">any more conversations I will definitely</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.039" end="00:39:45.450" style="s2">have more podcasts more conversations I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.990" end="00:39:48.559" style="s2">think I need to sync up a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.450" end="00:39:51.650" style="s2">with the collective before I start</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.559" end="00:39:53.759" style="s2">deciding what that&#39;s gonna look like but</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.650" end="00:39:57.589" style="s2">where I&#39;m feeling drawn right now is</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.759" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">into actually like longer form and rarer</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.589" end="00:40:04.349" style="s2">conversations so doing like really deep</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:07.079" style="s2">dives with folks about particular topics</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.349" end="00:40:11.250" style="s2">and so getting getting even more</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.079" end="00:40:12.740" style="s2">esoteric perhaps but that&#39;s just feels</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.250" end="00:40:14.849" style="s2">like that&#39;s where I&#39;m drawn and</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.740" end="00:40:17.940" style="s2">especially with the emergence of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.849" end="00:40:19.349" style="s2">the stoah I think that that is doing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.940" end="00:40:21.450" style="s2">lot of the work that I originally set</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.349" end="00:40:23.460" style="s2">out to do with emerge and so it&#39;s ended</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.450" end="00:40:26.069" style="s2">with rebel wisdom you know I&#39;m just like</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.460" end="00:40:28.710" style="s2">it&#39;s great when friends come and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.069" end="00:40:31.049" style="s2">like take care of parts of the picture</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.710" end="00:40:33.289" style="s2">so that you know you can just step back</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.049" end="00:40:38.789" style="s2">and do the thing that&#39;s uniquely yours</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.289" end="00:40:40.829" style="s2">so I think something like the more deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.789" end="00:40:45.750" style="s2">dives longer form is maybe what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.829" end="00:40:51.089" style="s2">uniquely mine yeah do you have a thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.750" end="00:40:55.230" style="s2">of topics subjects or people hmm</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.089" end="00:40:57.210" style="s2">I have some thoughts but I haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.230" end="00:40:59.250" style="s2">it sorted all out yet I&#39;m definitely</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.210" end="00:41:01.319" style="s2">gonna do a long series with Zach&#39;s Tina</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.250" end="00:41:03.990" style="s2">he lives nearby and we&#39;ve been spending</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.319" end="00:41:06.180" style="s2">time together I think there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.990" end="00:41:08.789" style="s2">he has to share that hasn&#39;t yet made it</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.180" end="00:41:10.380" style="s2">onto podcasts or media appearances that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.789" end="00:41:15.410" style="s2">he&#39;s made so that&#39;s certainly gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.380" end="00:41:18.210" style="s2">happen don&#39;t know beyond that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.410" end="00:41:21.170" style="s2">what&#39;s been the most surprising thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.210" end="00:41:21.170" style="s2">since you&#39;ve come out</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.210" end="00:41:30.850" style="s2">I think like how much easier it is for</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.290" end="00:41:33.730" style="s2">me to love the people I&#39;m around yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.850" end="00:41:36.370" style="s2">think both because of covent maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.730" end="00:41:38.620" style="s2">also because of my practice like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.370" end="00:41:40.630" style="s2">of the ways that I&#39;ve kept myself from</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.620" end="00:41:42.280" style="s2">caring about and loving the people that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.630" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">are just here in this community have</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.280" end="00:41:48.730" style="s2">fallen away and it feels just really</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">effortless to love them and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.730" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">wonderful and I was surprised because</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:54.550" style="s2">usually when you kind of like feel all</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:56.110" style="s2">lovey when you come off of a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.550" end="00:42:00.220" style="s2">that fades pretty quick you know because</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.110" end="00:42:02.650" style="s2">people are complicated but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.220" end="00:42:06.520" style="s2">stuck around so far so I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.650" end="00:42:11.380" style="s2">surprised about that hmm so you&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.520" end="00:42:13.480" style="s2">in the honeymoon period after the baby I</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.380" end="00:42:15.670" style="s2">mean it doesn&#39;t feel like it it feels</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.480" end="00:42:18.040" style="s2">like I got like just thrown back out</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.670" end="00:42:22.030" style="s2">into the wilds you know with them just</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.040" end="00:42:23.560" style="s2">the my life after the retreat and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.030" end="00:42:27.550" style="s2">partly why I&#39;m surprised that this part</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.560" end="00:42:30.790" style="s2">has maintained it&#39;s because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.550" end="00:42:32.710" style="s2">have like lost my shit in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.790" end="00:42:37.330" style="s2">respects pretty quickly after their</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.710" end="00:42:40.120" style="s2">treatment I felt felt like a good point</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.670" end="00:43:04.090" style="s2">into the kind of the dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.590" end="00:43:06.820" style="s2">media and the dynamics of sort of the</p>
