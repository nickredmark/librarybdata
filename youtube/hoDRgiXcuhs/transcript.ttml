<p begin="00:00:09.210" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">what I want to do is talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.099" end="00:00:16.890" style="s2">question of technological unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:18.630" style="s2">and to see if we can actually make sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.890" end="00:00:21.020" style="s2">of the question of whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.630" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">time is different</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.020" end="00:00:25.320" style="s2">it seems that for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:29.220" style="s2">several centuries at least</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.320" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">there has been a tension between one</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.820" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">and generative in the specific sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.020" end="00:00:49.230" style="s2">that it generates more wealth and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">the people who have put out of work when</p>

<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:13.560" style="s2">figured out how to overcome the dire</p>

<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:25.110" style="s2">employed for the past several hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.780" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">years however we once again find</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.110" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">ourselves in a conversation about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">and what I&#39;d like to consider is whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">or not this time is different and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:37.500" style="s2">order to do that what I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:40.079" style="s2">first figure out how to pose the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.500" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">question well and in order to get there</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.079" end="00:01:45.530" style="s2">we&#39;re going to need to articulate at</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">least six different concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.530" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">unfortunately they&#39;re very closely</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">related so it&#39;s not actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.439" end="00:01:56.869" style="s2">that hard so on the one hand what I</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">would propose is a chain of concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.869" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">skills ability to learn and capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:09.899" style="s2">increase your ability to learn these</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">were roughly similar to the classic</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.899" end="00:02:13.740" style="s2">chain of velocity acceleration of</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:16.170" style="s2">gherkin</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.740" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">six which is just say that the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.170" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">greater your ability to learn the more</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:23.820" style="s2">skills you can learn in the same period</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">of time or the more difficult skills you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.820" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">can learn in the same period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:30.180" style="s2">the more your capacity to increase your</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">ability to learn this is the jerk</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.180" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">parallel the more you&#39;re able to change</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:38.550" style="s2">your ability to learn in time so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:40.710" style="s2">the second derivative and then in</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.550" end="00:02:45.180" style="s2">parallel on the technology side of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.710" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">equation I might put tools the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.180" end="00:02:51.960" style="s2">to innovate and the capacity to increase</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">your capacity to innovate and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.960" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">to propose these are roughly equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:59.010" style="s2">instead of marching in lockstep</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:03:02.670" style="s2">so then given those concepts what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.010" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">would say is that first order what would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.670" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">typically witness is a situation where a</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:14.850" style="s2">tool is innovated and has the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">replace or obsolete some set of skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.850" end="00:03:17.220" style="s2">and so the first thing is that a human</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:20.910" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.220" end="00:03:24.780" style="s2">uses their learning their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.910" end="00:03:26.490" style="s2">learn to learn skills and those skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.780" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">are valuable in their society and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.490" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">go out and generate value human society</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.930" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">uses its capacity to innovate to build</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">tools and as those tools have value one</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">of the things that they may do is they</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:43.890" style="s2">may obsolete replace skills now one</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:45.600" style="s2">thing to keep in mind is that this does</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.890" end="00:03:48.480" style="s2">seem to be more or less a one-way</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.600" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">direction which is that tools replaced</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.480" end="00:03:53.010" style="s2">skills and once they&#39;ve done that those</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:54.210" style="s2">skills are no longer meaningfully died</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.010" end="00:03:57.890" style="s2">but at least not in the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.210" end="00:04:00.570" style="s2">they used to be so for example the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.890" end="00:04:03.030" style="s2">chainsaw more or less permanently</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.570" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">replaces the utility and the skill of</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.030" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">being able to use that kind of long</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:09.630" style="s2">three or five men saw to cut down a big</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:14.160" style="s2">tree having skillfulness in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.630" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">category is obsolete and generally the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.160" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">way that society has responded to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:22.650" style="s2">is by in fact expanding the scope of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">kinds of things for which one can be</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.650" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">skillful so to use a historical example</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.940" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:33.659" style="s2">someone had skillfulness in harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">wheat and then the automated wheat</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.659" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">harvester comes along the obsoletes that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:41.219" style="s2">skill that having that skill is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:42.870" style="s2">longer valuable and and yet what ends up</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.219" end="00:04:45.449" style="s2">happening is that there emerges a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.870" end="00:04:47.430" style="s2">space for skills a new opportunity to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.449" end="00:04:49.710" style="s2">skillful which might be for example in</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.430" end="00:04:52.159" style="s2">repairing farm machinery which it exists</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.710" end="00:04:54.599" style="s2">before farm machinery existed so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.159" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">human being that applies their capacity</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.599" end="00:05:00.419" style="s2">to learn to this new space of possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:04.289" style="s2">skillfulness develops the skills and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.419" end="00:05:05.669" style="s2">then now has a new valuable skill so</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.289" end="00:05:08.099" style="s2">this is essentially the dynamic we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.669" end="00:05:11.180" style="s2">a dynamic where you have a space of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.099" end="00:05:13.949" style="s2">possible skillfulness you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.180" end="00:05:15.389" style="s2">capacity to learn which relates to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.949" end="00:05:17.430" style="s2">space which is the degree to which one</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.389" end="00:05:18.900" style="s2">can then go into and actually acquire</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.430" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">and develop those skills in a timeframe</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.900" end="00:05:25.830" style="s2">that is valid and then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:28.590" style="s2">innovation which is the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.830" end="00:05:30.870" style="s2">generate tools that expands and fills</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.590" end="00:05:33.509" style="s2">the space of cost possible skillfulness</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.870" end="00:05:35.099" style="s2">so sort of like a circle of possible</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.509" end="00:05:37.710" style="s2">skillfulness and then a circle inside of</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.099" end="00:05:39.029" style="s2">it which is the space of obsoleted</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.710" end="00:05:41.089" style="s2">skillfulness that is being replaced by</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.029" end="00:05:44.550" style="s2">tools</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.089" end="00:05:45.569" style="s2">okay so first order the the conflict</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.550" end="00:05:48.210" style="s2">appears to be at the conflict between</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.569" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">tools and skills but I think pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.210" end="00:05:54.089" style="s2">quickly we can recognize that the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:55.169" style="s2">conflict is higher in the stack that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.089" end="00:05:57.750" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re beginning to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.169" end="00:06:00.659" style="s2">into the real space of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.750" end="00:06:05.069" style="s2">now that for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.659" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">human beings capacity to learn was much</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.069" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">much higher than society&#39;s capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:12.719" style="s2">innovate which is to say that as this</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:15.719" style="s2">the space of possibilities of skills</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.719" end="00:06:18.000" style="s2">expanded individual human beings</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.719" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">capacity to learn meant that they could</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.000" end="00:06:22.289" style="s2">come into and develop skillfulness at a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:24.900" style="s2">rate that was much faster than</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.289" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">technology than innovations ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.900" end="00:06:30.689" style="s2">fill that space so we&#39;ve had kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:33.180" style="s2">balance where once technology is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.689" end="00:06:36.690" style="s2">obsolete at a certain possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.180" end="00:06:38.699" style="s2">skillfulness it&#39;s done but that as long</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.690" end="00:06:40.770" style="s2">as the sphere of possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.699" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">skillfulness has been expanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.770" end="00:06:46.050" style="s2">humanity&#39;s capacity to learn has enabled</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:47.550" style="s2">human beings to learn adapt that new</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.050" end="00:06:49.110" style="s2">possibility of skillfulness outside of</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.550" end="00:06:51.539" style="s2">the sphere the advancing sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.110" end="00:06:54.990" style="s2">technology and then remain in position</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.860" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">problematic and it comes from two</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.449" end="00:07:07.229" style="s2">different directions one direction is</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:10.380" style="s2">the question of what is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.229" end="00:07:13.050" style="s2">between the capacity to learn and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.380" end="00:07:14.580" style="s2">capacity to innovate because now we can</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.050" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">talk about that second derivative which</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.580" end="00:07:17.639" style="s2">is the capacity to increase your</p>

<p begin="00:07:17.639" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">increase your capacity to innovate and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:26.669" style="s2">here&#39;s what we noticed the first major</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:29.159" style="s2">problem human beings tend to be as so</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.669" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">far at least relatively limited in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.159" end="00:07:33.330" style="s2">second order which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:37.289" style="s2">evolution has gifted us with a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.330" end="00:07:39.509" style="s2">large ambient capacity to learn but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.289" end="00:07:41.639" style="s2">not quite clear exactly how much our</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.639" end="00:07:47.330" style="s2">learn is it&#39;s there seems to be some</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.300" end="00:07:49.860" style="s2">relatively narrow band that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.330" end="00:07:52.199" style="s2">contemporary human being may in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.860" end="00:07:56.310" style="s2">have more or less the same capacity to</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.310" end="00:08:00.719" style="s2">have more to learn and we have more</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.440" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">skills and different skills to learn but</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.719" end="00:08:05.219" style="s2">the capacity to learn may in fact not</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:08.900" style="s2">have changed that much</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.219" end="00:08:14.009" style="s2">by contrast the capacity to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.900" end="00:08:16.409" style="s2">seems to be vastly more flexible and our</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.409" end="00:08:21.449" style="s2">increased quite dramatically and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.509" end="00:08:23.580" style="s2">while the relationship between capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.449" end="00:08:25.469" style="s2">innovative capacity to learn may have</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.580" end="00:08:26.969" style="s2">for a very long period of time the grand</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.969" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">decisively in the favor of human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.270" end="00:08:35.070" style="s2">we now may be reaching a crossover point</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:37.529" style="s2">where the capacity to innovate is now</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.070" end="00:08:39.870" style="s2">reaching and potentially exceeding the</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.529" end="00:08:41.550" style="s2">capacity to learn and what we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.870" end="00:08:45.540" style="s2">might think about is to think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.550" end="00:08:49.320" style="s2">these circles there&#39;s the outside circle</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.540" end="00:08:51.209" style="s2">is the expanding circumference of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.320" end="00:08:53.930" style="s2">opportunity for stillness the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.209" end="00:08:55.960" style="s2">things that could be done the tad die</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.930" end="00:08:59.720" style="s2">then there&#39;s a circle which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.960" end="00:09:01.940" style="s2">expanding ability to be skillful which</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.720" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">is the capacity to learn applied to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.940" end="00:09:07.029" style="s2">build skills among human beings and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:09.020" style="s2">the inner circle is the expanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.029" end="00:09:11.270" style="s2">generation of tools the innovation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.020" end="00:09:13.370" style="s2">tools that replaces the human beings of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.270" end="00:09:15.320" style="s2">capacity and the relationship that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.370" end="00:09:18.709" style="s2">focusing on right now is the rate</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.320" end="00:09:22.790" style="s2">between circle 2 and circle 3 so circle</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.709" end="00:09:24.500" style="s2">2 is expanding slower than circle 3 then</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.790" end="00:09:27.770" style="s2">at some point circle 3 will in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.500" end="00:09:29.480" style="s2">reach and exceed circle 2 so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.770" end="00:09:31.010" style="s2">that&#39;s one dimension in and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.480" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">fundamentally anchored in that second</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.010" end="00:09:35.180" style="s2">derivative which is the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">increase the capacity and so we can ask</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.180" end="00:09:39.020" style="s2">some questions which is well what what</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:41.149" style="s2">is the capacity to increase the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.020" end="00:09:43.070" style="s2">of learning to what degree have we</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.149" end="00:09:45.320" style="s2">explored that question how much do we</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.070" end="00:09:47.690" style="s2">know about it what is it</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.320" end="00:09:49.790" style="s2">right now already like are we doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.690" end="00:09:51.800" style="s2">good job at focusing our energies on</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.790" end="00:09:54.709" style="s2">increasing the capacity to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.800" end="00:09:56.920" style="s2">then secondarily to what degree is there</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.709" end="00:09:59.750" style="s2">a way to apply the capacity to innovate</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.920" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">back on the capacity to learn so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.750" end="00:10:06.350" style="s2">our machines are helping us overcome the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:07.310" style="s2">constraints of our machines I think the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.350" end="00:10:09.470" style="s2">answer to that is we don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.310" end="00:10:12.430" style="s2">this is not something that we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.470" end="00:10:14.570" style="s2">of wisdom or deep experience in thus far</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.430" end="00:10:16.220" style="s2">but at least we now understand what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.570" end="00:10:20.510" style="s2">rate with the question is right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.220" end="00:10:23.270" style="s2">obvious that the experience in the past</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.510" end="00:10:24.980" style="s2">which was based upon the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.270" end="00:10:27.110" style="s2">relationship between that second circle</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.980" end="00:10:28.790" style="s2">and the third circle was one where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.110" end="00:10:31.400" style="s2">second circle had a higher capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.790" end="00:10:33.890" style="s2">grow so long as the first circle</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.400" end="00:10:36.110" style="s2">expanded the second circle had territory</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.890" end="00:10:38.779" style="s2">into which to grow and had time to do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.110" end="00:10:41.089" style="s2">before the center circle could reach up</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.779" end="00:10:43.430" style="s2">and connect with it and the question the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.089" end="00:10:46.190" style="s2">present moment is is that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.430" end="00:10:48.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the same or is our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.190" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">innovate simply higher than our capacity</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.100" end="00:10:52.579" style="s2">to learn is our capacity to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.020" style="s2">capacity in to be simply higher than our</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.579" end="00:10:57.079" style="s2">capacity to increase our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.020" end="00:10:58.940" style="s2">learn and if it is then for sure that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.079" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">center circle is going to race out and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.940" end="00:11:05.170" style="s2">completely occupy the entire possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:09.010" style="s2">of skillfulness and there will be no</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.170" end="00:11:12.380" style="s2">value in human skill</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.010" end="00:11:13.820" style="s2">so that&#39;s that sort of that&#39;s that now</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.380" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">the other side of it which is also</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.820" end="00:11:17.029" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s kind of been the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:18.860" style="s2">subject of frankly the debate thus far</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.029" end="00:11:21.950" style="s2">is the relationship between the first</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.860" end="00:11:24.290" style="s2">circle and the second and third meeting</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.950" end="00:11:25.970" style="s2">well what pace is there an increase in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.290" end="00:11:28.250" style="s2">the in the size of the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.970" end="00:11:31.070" style="s2">skillfulness so far we&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.250" end="00:11:34.430" style="s2">situation where when we have removed a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.070" end="00:11:36.589" style="s2">particular volume skill like harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.430" end="00:11:39.800" style="s2">wheat we have also generated in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.589" end="00:11:40.940" style="s2">generatively quite substantial at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.800" end="00:11:42.050" style="s2">the circumference is increased in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.940" end="00:11:45.470" style="s2">therefore the surface area is increased</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.050" end="00:11:46.940" style="s2">at a higher rate new possibilities so</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.470" end="00:11:49.459" style="s2">that first circle has continued to</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.940" end="00:11:52.820" style="s2">expand even as the third circle has</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.459" end="00:11:53.899" style="s2">expanded but is there any principal</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.820" end="00:11:55.130" style="s2">reason to believe that that will</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.899" end="00:11:58.220" style="s2">continue to be the case</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.130" end="00:12:00.800" style="s2">is there any literally any principal</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.220" end="00:12:04.070" style="s2">reason to believe or understand how and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.800" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">what the relationship is between the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.070" end="00:12:11.570" style="s2">expansion of tools and the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:14.269" style="s2">of human skillfulness again I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.570" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">think we know history has told us that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.269" end="00:12:19.130" style="s2">so far at least every time that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:23.209" style="s2">built new tools we have also built new</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.130" end="00:12:25.730" style="s2">possibilities of human skills on us but</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.209" end="00:12:28.010" style="s2">that&#39;s just history it may be that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.730" end="00:12:29.300" style="s2">reaching the end of that of that curve</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.010" end="00:12:33.649" style="s2">for reasons that we don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.300" end="00:12:36.019" style="s2">understand so I guess the point here is</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.649" end="00:12:40.279" style="s2">that from my perspective we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.019" end="00:12:41.000" style="s2">have any clarity on this question or at</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.279" end="00:12:43.399" style="s2">least we don&#39;t have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.000" end="00:12:44.870" style="s2">generate answers with clarity but</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.399" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">hopefully this particular presentation</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.870" end="00:12:51.170" style="s2">has at least made into well-formed</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">question and we can now potentially take</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.170" end="00:12:56.870" style="s2">a closer look at the question and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">be in a position to actually make some</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.870" end="00:12:59.680" style="s2">good choices around it</p>
