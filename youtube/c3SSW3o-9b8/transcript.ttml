<p begin="00:00:03.990" end="00:00:07.109" style="s2">I&#39;ve really been looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.430" end="00:00:10.590" style="s2">having this conversation with you for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.109" end="00:00:12.240" style="s2">while Stu it um so I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.590" end="00:00:14.969" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen any of the other interviews</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done like reading pamela mang</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.969" end="00:00:19.320" style="s2">and Riesman and uploaded was John</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:24.680" style="s2">Fullerton um just just couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.320" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">ago I really enjoy because so much of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.680" end="00:00:29.970" style="s2">working regenerative lease also paying</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">attention to one&#39;s own inner story and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.970" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">how we react to how we interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:40.020" style="s2">world out there and and how we challenge</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:45.510" style="s2">ourselves in our own frames and develop</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.020" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">our own cosmovision as we move along and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.510" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">I know that you&#39;ve I mean I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">inspired by your work for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:56.489" style="s2">time like when we met here on me okay I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">mentioned you mentioned this to you that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.489" end="00:01:01.250" style="s2">you work with sim from the rim in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">little book ecological design has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.250" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">giving me some of the key pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">I&#39;ve been building a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">framework for the last 20 years and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">so you the scale linking design bit in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.560" style="s2">particular but I would love to for you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">to just start with telling a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.560" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">your story because I know that that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:23.159" style="s2">you&#39;ve had this amazing opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:25.320" style="s2">not just work with with elders like sim</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.159" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">but also you spend all this time with</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.320" end="00:01:30.869" style="s2">Christopher Alexander and now you get to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:34.710" style="s2">work closely with John Fullerton and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.869" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">yeah how did you get to where you are</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.710" end="00:01:39.750" style="s2">now Oh Thank You Daniel very gracious</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:43.700" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.750" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">I grew up on Vancouver Island which is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.700" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">magnificent part of the coastal</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">temperate rainforest that stretches all</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:55.710" style="s2">the way from Northern California all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:02:00.110" style="s2">way up to Alaska and my island was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.710" end="00:02:03.689" style="s2">the midst of this bio cultural diversity</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.110" end="00:02:05.880" style="s2">there&#39;s just extraordinary ancient</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.689" end="00:02:07.799" style="s2">forests would store more carbon than</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.880" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">really any other ecosystems on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.799" end="00:02:12.330" style="s2">entire planet and therefore probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">have the greatest cognitive capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.330" end="00:02:16.290" style="s2">more cells firing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:18.720" style="s2">with all of that living active matter</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.290" end="00:02:21.590" style="s2">and and so I grew up with this paradox</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.720" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">of these magnificent ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.590" end="00:02:28.380" style="s2">beautiful fjords mountains you know Briz</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">Lee&#39;s you know right across the Georgia</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.380" end="00:02:32.460" style="s2">Strait</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:34.740" style="s2">I felt that so profoundly and then when</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.460" end="00:02:38.070" style="s2">we went on family trips we&#39;d go past</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.740" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">these massive you know lunar scale clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.070" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">cuts and I just had this sense how can</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">we be extracting so much and in my youth</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:51.600" style="s2">I saw the forest depleted I saw this</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.600" style="s2">massive pulp mill that was the lifeline</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.600" end="00:02:55.800" style="s2">of my town actually shut down</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:02:58.260" style="s2">deconstructed and literally shipped off</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.800" end="00:03:00.260" style="s2">to China because too many trees had been</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.260" end="00:03:04.080" style="s2">cut the industry couldn&#39;t be sustained</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.260" end="00:03:06.870" style="s2">the fish you know salmon halibut caught</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.080" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">I mean fished out the mines</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.870" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">you know actually worked out within a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.830" style="s2">few decades and so like when I go back</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:16.170" style="s2">to my hometown it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.830" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">unrecognizable everything has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.170" end="00:03:21.270" style="s2">extracted a lot of it is is regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:22.680" style="s2">and bouncing back but it just led me on</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.270" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">the path and you&#39;re growing up at sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.680" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">of the edge of this massive extractive</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:30.870" style="s2">economy even even in Canada even in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:32.520" style="s2">British Columbia growing up I just had</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.870" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">this sense I wanted to connect with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.520" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">patterns of life with living systems the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:40.140" style="s2">dynamics of nature and that led me to</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:41.850" style="s2">this nascent field of complex living</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.140" end="00:03:45.180" style="s2">systems and it was incredibly exciting</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.850" end="00:03:48.870" style="s2">time I made my way to Berkeley for my</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.180" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">PhD and it was at a time when chaos</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.870" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">theory was just being developed by Steve</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:55.580" style="s2">snail right down the hall you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:58.920" style="s2">strange attractors fractal geometry</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.580" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">nonlinear dynamics and really in an</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.920" end="00:04:06.120" style="s2">interdisciplinary way so in Berkeley you</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.700" end="00:04:07.830" style="s2">know I was connecting you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.120" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">deep mathematics around this to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.830" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">practical physics chemistry biology</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:15.840" style="s2">economics sociology cross-cutting you</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:19.019" style="s2">know what could be is in mathematics no</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.840" end="00:04:20.940" style="s2">yes yes so I did my my doctorate at</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.019" end="00:04:24.150" style="s2">Berkeley in applied mathematics but</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.940" end="00:04:26.610" style="s2">really my focus was in ecological</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.150" end="00:04:27.930" style="s2">economics which was just emerging at</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.610" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.930" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">extraordinary man Richard nor guard</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:35.220" style="s2">really is the co-founder of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:39.560" style="s2">field of ecological economics alongside</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.220" end="00:04:41.960" style="s2">Robert Costanza and newer guard</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.560" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">continues to emphasize a deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.960" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">qualitative systems approach which kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">of complements where the hard edge</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:55.620" style="s2">analytic side of ecological economics is</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:57.720" style="s2">gone and pricing nature which maybe as</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.620" end="00:04:59.910" style="s2">in this step you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.720" end="00:05:02.130" style="s2">fascinating I mean as I rewind and think</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.910" end="00:05:04.770" style="s2">about early 90s leading up to the Rio</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.130" end="00:05:06.990" style="s2">summit thinking about the contested</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.770" end="00:05:09.180" style="s2">foundations of ecological economics a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.990" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">lot of what we&#39;re still trying to work</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.180" end="00:05:12.889" style="s2">through was right there you know with</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:16.590" style="s2">someone like more guard emphasizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.889" end="00:05:20.310" style="s2">profound questioning of worldviews</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.590" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">epistemologies really trying to reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.310" end="00:05:25.259" style="s2">economics at a deep deep ground and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:26.849" style="s2">Costanza making really important</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.259" end="00:05:29.009" style="s2">technical contributions that could</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.849" end="00:05:31.669" style="s2">immediately help us shift markets but</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.009" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">maybe have some unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.669" end="00:05:35.909" style="s2">so just briefly let me let me go into</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:37.560" style="s2">the briefly because it&#39;s such an</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.909" end="00:05:39.840" style="s2">important bit because it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.560" end="00:05:44.150" style="s2">what you sort of turning the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.840" end="00:05:46.949" style="s2">contrast upon is how back then this</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.150" end="00:05:49.680" style="s2">dilemma that we&#39;re in of on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.949" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">yeah we need quantitative information in</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.680" end="00:05:53.849" style="s2">mathematics is super useful into that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:57.210" style="s2">kind of analytical way of seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.849" end="00:06:00.419" style="s2">enormously powerful but but how so often</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.210" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">we then and because it also slots into</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.419" end="00:06:10.349" style="s2">the systems we&#39;ve built and and is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:12.810" style="s2">action oriented in them we dismiss the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.349" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">qualitative aspects and and and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.810" end="00:06:18.990" style="s2">patterns and the stuff that you like</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:21.599" style="s2">please continue that you see me well</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.990" end="00:06:24.360" style="s2">well exactly you know the the ways of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.599" end="00:06:27.630" style="s2">being you know cognition at a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.360" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">level our social matrix these deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.630" end="00:06:33.900" style="s2">foundations of what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:36.419" style="s2">so I emerged from graduate school in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.900" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">1992 literally just as the Rio summit</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.419" end="00:06:41.159" style="s2">was happening and was on a path to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:42.839" style="s2">could we take</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.159" end="00:06:44.699" style="s2">this nascent field of ecological</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.839" end="00:06:47.759" style="s2">economics this nascent field of complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.699" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">living systems could we apply it in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.759" end="00:06:52.979" style="s2">world what would that mean ecologists</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:54.929" style="s2">even then we&#39;re saying and I Neve</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.979" end="00:06:58.159" style="s2">noticed this too of Daniel ecologist</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.929" end="00:07:00.629" style="s2">were saying the ecosystems we love are</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.159" end="00:07:02.819" style="s2">falling apart how can I be a neutral</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.629" end="00:07:05.269" style="s2">scientist in every field anthropologists</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.819" end="00:07:08.759" style="s2">we&#39;re realizing these cultures I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.709" end="00:08:15.059" style="s2">would argue and we could say if we go</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.189" end="00:08:48.120" style="s2">the beginning I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.870" end="00:08:51.959" style="s2">this deep weave of how can we have these</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.120" end="00:08:54.510" style="s2">living systems emerge gracefully in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.959" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">profoundly place-based way</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.510" end="00:08:58.200" style="s2">and that led me to write a book called</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">ecological design with the extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.200" end="00:09:03.270" style="s2">man sim van Duren who is a professor at</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">Berkeley so I kind of got to do a second</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.270" end="00:09:07.590" style="s2">PhD it was just lovely I got to spend</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:11.280" style="s2">another three years doing this deep dive</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.590" end="00:09:13.620" style="s2">with sim exploring a living systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.280" end="00:09:16.500" style="s2">perspective for the built environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.620" end="00:09:18.420" style="s2">for landscapes for products</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.500" end="00:09:20.490" style="s2">infrastructure what would that deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.420" end="00:09:25.140" style="s2">weave look was it was that under a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.490" end="00:09:28.230" style="s2">research fellowship at Berkeley no you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.140" end="00:09:30.060" style="s2">know actually it was supported by Simms</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.230" end="00:09:31.890" style="s2">nonprofit which was known as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.060" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">farallon&#39;s Institute in those days</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.890" end="00:09:38.400" style="s2">so we literally got modest grant support</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:40.500" style="s2">to do this research project and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.400" end="00:09:42.870" style="s2">serious you know long-term collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.500" end="00:09:45.060" style="s2">it&#39;s really really extraordinary and in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.870" end="00:09:47.900" style="s2">those days I was working closely with</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.060" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">Christopher Alexander as well who is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.900" end="00:09:55.020" style="s2">legendary architect planner spent</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:57.090" style="s2">decades at Berkeley and wrote these you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.020" end="00:10:01.350" style="s2">know beautiful books pattern language in</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.090" end="00:10:04.050" style="s2">the nature of order which is yeah you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.350" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">helped him curate those not like how did</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.050" end="00:10:10.890" style="s2">them that work like how did you work</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:11.160" style="s2">together well yeah yeah the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.890" end="00:10:12.930" style="s2">order</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.160" end="00:10:16.980" style="s2">everyone must read it&#39;s it&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.930" end="00:10:20.390" style="s2">volumes it&#39;s 1500 pages everybody who</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.980" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">can take a sabbatical level of the year</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.390" end="00:10:29.700" style="s2">with it so so Chris was really looking</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.730" end="00:10:31.620" style="s2">at the foundations of the living world</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.700" end="00:10:34.620" style="s2">and he called it the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.620" end="00:10:38.190" style="s2">wholeness then how do you actually look</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.620" end="00:10:42.570" style="s2">at these deep relationships the flows of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.190" end="00:10:44.400" style="s2">water plants the trees the people every</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.570" end="00:10:46.830" style="s2">part of the built environment every</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.400" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">piece of furniture in a nested scale</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.830" end="00:10:52.050" style="s2">linking way from how do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:53.940" style="s2">the design of a room to the house to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.050" end="00:10:56.970" style="s2">street that it&#39;s on to the open spaces</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.940" end="00:10:59.370" style="s2">to urban design to regional planet</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.970" end="00:11:02.340" style="s2">regional planning and now we probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.370" end="00:11:03.450" style="s2">extend it right to biosphere design but</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.340" end="00:11:06.210" style="s2">Chris was trained as a mathematician</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.450" end="00:11:08.390" style="s2">like me and we both have wandered very</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.210" end="00:11:11.480" style="s2">para pathetically across many feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.390" end="00:11:12.980" style="s2">and so Chris always kept his deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.480" end="00:11:16.040" style="s2">mathematical training and he was looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.980" end="00:11:17.540" style="s2">for deep structure deep pattern in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.040" end="00:11:20.390" style="s2">built environment and very much in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.540" end="00:11:23.089" style="s2">ecological systems as well and he chris</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.390" end="00:11:26.120" style="s2">is a wonderful / Majin so chris would</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.089" end="00:11:27.829" style="s2">say well sustainability wonderful but so</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.120" end="00:11:29.779" style="s2">much of it is just so ugly and lifeless</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.829" end="00:11:31.010" style="s2">and and at the first day I was like what</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.779" end="00:11:32.570" style="s2">are you talking about Chris I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.010" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">world&#39;s falling apart I mean we got to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.570" end="00:11:37.790" style="s2">just get things done technically - but</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:41.230" style="s2">he had some deep deep points about how a</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.790" end="00:11:44.839" style="s2">response to the sustainability crisis</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.230" end="00:11:48.560" style="s2">needs to be deeply adapted deeply</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.839" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">attuned to place tuned to the ecology it</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.560" end="00:11:53.450" style="s2">should be beautiful it should make us</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:55.550" style="s2">feel whole and if we&#39;re on that path if</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.450" end="00:11:58.160" style="s2">we&#39;re creating that kind of beauty</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.550" end="00:11:59.750" style="s2">together then there&#39;s probably a way</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.160" end="00:12:01.790" style="s2">that we can connect it to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.750" end="00:12:04.250" style="s2">regeneration of different different</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.790" end="00:12:06.110" style="s2">scales from neighborhoods to bioregions</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.250" end="00:12:10.220" style="s2">to the planet would you how would you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.110" end="00:12:11.899" style="s2">see the impact of Chris&#39;s work Legon on</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.220" end="00:12:14.120" style="s2">the one hand him I mean a pattern</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.899" end="00:12:16.339" style="s2">languages is one of the the classics</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.120" end="00:12:18.649" style="s2">that almost any architectural student</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.339" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">will at least pretend that they&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.649" end="00:12:23.630" style="s2">or buy and have on their shelf but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:27.470" style="s2">just wondering how many people actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.630" end="00:12:30.050" style="s2">really taking deep enough of a dive into</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.470" end="00:12:32.930" style="s2">this this opus that is really quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.050" end="00:12:34.730" style="s2">remarkable and to then understand it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.930" end="00:12:36.980" style="s2">apply it I mean I know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.730" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">people who picked up on or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.980" end="00:12:41.390" style="s2">developing a pattern language for</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:43.220" style="s2">evolutionary work in human societies and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:46.130" style="s2">lots of people work on pattern languages</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.220" end="00:12:48.110" style="s2">and so that means definitely travel but</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.130" end="00:12:50.360" style="s2">a particularly I found it that the depth</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.110" end="00:12:52.699" style="s2">of work in the nature of order which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.360" end="00:12:55.070" style="s2">only got through the first book always</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.699" end="00:12:58.970" style="s2">thinking I can&#39;t wait to read the animal</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:08.750" style="s2">interact beyond the client saying a few</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.620" end="00:16:10.550" style="s2">things Chris turns it into a profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.750" end="00:16:12.680" style="s2">participatory process and something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.550" end="00:16:16.280" style="s2">can can be done with entire communities</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.680" end="00:16:18.800" style="s2">as they redesign neighborhoods doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.280" end="00:16:20.780" style="s2">that in practice has challenged the</p>

<p begin="00:16:20.780" end="00:16:27.590" style="s2">contract around and so forth so I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.500" end="00:16:30.950" style="s2">love to see profound explorations of</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.150" end="00:16:40.430" style="s2">but it&#39;s tricky I&#39;m wondering like</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.210" end="00:16:54.080" style="s2">from knowing Chris well I have a sense</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.050" end="00:22:15.389" style="s2">is the work of David bone he was</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.540" end="00:24:48.730" style="s2">because it to me it&#39;s the core inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.870" end="00:24:51.490" style="s2">and so if we begin to weave this a</p>

<p begin="00:25:22.810" end="00:25:27.370" style="s2">think it occurs in the world is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.840" end="00:25:30.190" style="s2">much Ron Andrea called structural</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.370" end="00:25:33.430" style="s2">coupling where literally you&#39;d have two</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.460" end="00:25:44.530" style="s2">those flows and interactions which</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.130" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">create various sorts of patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.530" end="00:25:49.570" style="s2">habits in a sense ultimately of</p>

<p begin="00:25:49.570" end="00:25:56.200" style="s2">those at the scale of our household and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.660" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">then working our way out to our</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.659" end="00:27:18.270" style="s2">that love and connection maybe is the</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.490" end="00:29:40.470" style="s2">of them is a guy called Gonzalo Salazar</p>

<p begin="00:29:53.070" end="00:29:57.510" style="s2">like using this idea that we bring forth</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.320" end="00:29:59.370" style="s2">the world in conversation which links to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.510" end="00:30:01.380" style="s2">the whole kind of living the questions</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.380" end="00:30:07.050" style="s2">yes and and we bring it forth through</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:12.060" style="s2">love like weaving in both matter honors</p>

<p begin="00:30:16.290" end="00:30:22.740" style="s2">quite a while but but then II Wilson has</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.150" end="00:30:25.920" style="s2">kind of popularized and and for me that</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.740" end="00:30:28.050" style="s2">this like mentioning David Abraham I</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.920" end="00:30:30.150" style="s2">think David Abrams book is just so</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.050" end="00:30:31.890" style="s2">beautiful there as well of the sensuous</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.150" end="00:30:35.970" style="s2">and in this there&#39;s one paragraph way</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.890" end="00:30:38.970" style="s2">way says that our senses and who we are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.970" end="00:30:42.030" style="s2">have been shaped in conviviality with</p>

<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:56.160" style="s2">quote but it&#39;s it&#39;s just pure poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.090" end="00:31:00.320" style="s2">it speaks to exactly that larger</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.160" end="00:31:05.260" style="s2">conversation of how like for me and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.320" end="00:31:07.419" style="s2">people get a little bit touchy when</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.260" end="00:31:11.049" style="s2">overeducated privileged white guys like</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.419" end="00:31:14.200" style="s2">me talk about the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.049" end="00:31:17.080" style="s2">indigenous knowledge um but but I do</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.200" end="00:31:20.770" style="s2">feel that the that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.080" end="00:31:27.280" style="s2">problem of now coming to a true healing</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.770" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">if we don&#39;t allow so-called</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.280" end="00:31:30.520" style="s2">non-indigenous people were all</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:32.650" style="s2">indigenous to Planet Earth and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.520" end="00:31:35.230" style="s2">that to ultimately whether we call it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.650" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">rien habitation like the early bio</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.230" end="00:31:41.080" style="s2">regionalists that or we call it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:43.210" style="s2">re-envision ization becoming native to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.080" end="00:31:45.910" style="s2">place again even if we weren&#39;t born</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.210" end="00:31:47.890" style="s2">there but by by having these larger</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.910" end="00:31:49.809" style="s2">conversations I think that&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.890" end="00:31:52.510" style="s2">heart of what we&#39;re trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.809" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">our work in regeneration it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.510" end="00:31:56.860" style="s2">about those how do we connect to place</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:32:03.580" style="s2">how do we connect to region and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.860" end="00:32:05.620" style="s2">planet but in a way that supports and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.580" end="00:32:09.730" style="s2">maintains the whole community of life at</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.620" end="00:32:12.100" style="s2">all those scales so make that how did</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.730" end="00:32:14.140" style="s2">you make that journey so from working</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.100" end="00:32:17.710" style="s2">with Christopher you then set up your</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.140" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">company or two places and work for 10-15</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.710" end="00:32:21.940" style="s2">years and that and then that&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:24.910" style="s2">ended up getting hit hunted by the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.940" end="00:32:26.860" style="s2">Capitol Institute well there there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.910" end="00:32:29.919" style="s2">another really important step along the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.860" end="00:32:31.990" style="s2">way which is a wonderful nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.919" end="00:32:34.870" style="s2">conservation organization called eco</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.990" end="00:32:37.299" style="s2">trust and they&#39;re based in what they</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.870" end="00:32:40.780" style="s2">call salmon nation which I love it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.299" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">really the places the salmon can swim to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.780" end="00:32:47.470" style="s2">on the west coast of North America the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:50.169" style="s2">Pacific coast and it&#39;s a vast vast</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.470" end="00:32:53.230" style="s2">region my home region right right in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.169" end="00:32:56.169" style="s2">heart of salmon territory and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.230" end="00:32:58.090" style="s2">Ecotrust even back in the early 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.169" end="00:32:59.950" style="s2">when I spent three years there was</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.090" end="00:33:02.230" style="s2">exploring what they called a</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.950" end="00:33:05.590" style="s2">conservation economy so kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.230" end="00:33:07.929" style="s2">interesting precursor maybe twin to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.590" end="00:33:10.750" style="s2">regenerative economy and we were</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.929" end="00:33:13.390" style="s2">literally exploring modern languages for</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.750" end="00:33:16.270" style="s2">bioregional regeneration and how that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.390" end="00:33:18.429" style="s2">could roll up to create a conservation</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.270" end="00:33:19.290" style="s2">economy and wonderful thing about</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.429" end="00:33:21.380" style="s2">Ecotrust it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.290" end="00:33:24.680" style="s2">they are continuing their still thriving</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.380" end="00:33:27.270" style="s2">25 years later they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.680" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">experimenting on the ground with things</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.270" end="00:33:35.850" style="s2">like ecological forestry investment</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:37.950" style="s2">funds so we helped connect one of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.850" end="00:33:40.170" style="s2">early funds with federal level resources</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.950" end="00:33:43.770" style="s2">in the early 2000 so very practically</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.170" end="00:33:46.130" style="s2">saying could you take a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.770" end="00:33:50.670" style="s2">what we just discussed Daniel I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.130" end="00:33:53.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to to bring the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.670" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">that field of wholeness and the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.880" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">those relationships of structural</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:34:01.980" style="s2">coupling and sensing place those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:04.950" style="s2">fundamentally indigenous ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.980" end="00:34:08.120" style="s2">and being there&#39;s no way to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.950" end="00:34:11.250" style="s2">into an abstract financial transaction</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.120" end="00:34:13.110" style="s2">that&#39;s the key conundrum right but even</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.250" end="00:34:15.980" style="s2">back in the early 2000s he could trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.110" end="00:34:19.230" style="s2">was wrestling they had incredible</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.980" end="00:34:21.710" style="s2">ecologists on staff actually a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.230" end="00:34:24.300" style="s2">strong program in indigenous knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.710" end="00:34:26.460" style="s2">to their credit that&#39;s it&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.300" end="00:34:29.490" style="s2">core freaka trust to draw on the wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.460" end="00:34:31.890" style="s2">of that in that region in that region</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.490" end="00:34:35.220" style="s2">those were very strong as what sport</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.890" end="00:34:35.610" style="s2">area and still vibrant cultures the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.220" end="00:34:38.040" style="s2">Haida</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.610" end="00:34:40.530" style="s2">the Tlingit the quad youth where I grew</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.040" end="00:34:42.540" style="s2">up and so they were trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.530" end="00:34:44.970" style="s2">things like indigenous knowledge with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.540" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">modern forest management and somehow</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.970" end="00:34:50.580" style="s2">bring that into an investment term sheet</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.060" end="00:34:52.620" style="s2">that says you&#39;ll somehow get some</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.580" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">returns tied to the health of the land</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.620" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">and not just to the extraction from the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:35:03.090" style="s2">land and they continue you know with</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:06.300" style="s2">that inquiry so you know the bridge for</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.090" end="00:35:08.940" style="s2">me was working with people like Chris</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.300" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">and sim testing ideas around what we now</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.940" end="00:35:12.480" style="s2">call regenerative design we called a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:16.860" style="s2">ecological design it&#39;s just it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.480" end="00:35:20.180" style="s2">same the same weaving working with those</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.860" end="00:35:22.230" style="s2">ideas she&#39;s trying to shift into</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.180" end="00:35:23.910" style="s2">practically getting things built on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.230" end="00:35:27.270" style="s2">ground or practically shifting from</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.910" end="00:35:29.310" style="s2">awful you know industrial forestry in</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.270" end="00:35:31.620" style="s2">the Pacific Northwest to this day you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.310" end="00:35:32.520" style="s2">know you&#39;re clear cutting every 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.620" end="00:35:34.080" style="s2">or so and just</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.520" end="00:35:37.110" style="s2">leaving this devastated landscape</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.080" end="00:35:40.290" style="s2">because it seems to optimize you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.110" end="00:35:43.170" style="s2">the most extractive yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.290" end="00:35:45.000" style="s2">version you know of the economic model</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.170" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">where you&#39;ve externalized everything you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.000" end="00:35:50.730" style="s2">know that the ravaged communities</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">destroyed ecosystems just if you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.730" end="00:35:54.510" style="s2">ignore that and you run the number so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:57.210" style="s2">looks like you cut it every forty years</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.510" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">or so you know we were trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.210" end="00:36:03.960" style="s2">what if you have a whole range of values</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">and you&#39;re perceiving and understanding</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:09.900" style="s2">these different parties so that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.580" end="00:36:12.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a nearby municipality that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.900" end="00:36:14.520" style="s2">benefits from much better water quality</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.450" end="00:36:16.890" style="s2">and quantity could they you know be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.520" end="00:36:19.290" style="s2">part of this so all those explorations</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.890" end="00:36:20.490" style="s2">it whether it&#39;s the built environment</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.290" end="00:36:23.070" style="s2">you know working a lot with green</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.490" end="00:36:25.290" style="s2">buildings and saying okay can we make it</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.070" end="00:36:27.900" style="s2">even more energy-efficient less toxic</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.290" end="00:36:31.200" style="s2">more joyful and abundant for the people</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.900" end="00:36:33.750" style="s2">within it does that pencil and so I got</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.200" end="00:36:39.420" style="s2">really obsessed in the early 2000s with</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.750" end="00:36:41.700" style="s2">you know why deep living management of</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.750" end="00:36:58.710" style="s2">you&#39;re not manufacturing anything toxic</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.450" style="s2">because it&#39;s harm to workers and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.710" end="00:37:02.250" style="s2">ecosystems that you then bring into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.450" end="00:37:04.380" style="s2">building but causes harm to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.250" end="00:37:07.140" style="s2">occupants that you then dispose of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.380" end="00:37:10.500" style="s2">causes farm somewhere else why did that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.140" end="00:37:14.550" style="s2">why did that seem to pencil the toxicity</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.500" end="00:37:16.620" style="s2">the ridiculous energy is right or on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.550" end="00:37:18.900" style="s2">land side you know why did it seem to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.620" end="00:37:22.470" style="s2">make sense to clear-cut or tortured you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.900" end="00:37:24.960" style="s2">industrial agriculture and that led me</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.470" end="00:37:26.810" style="s2">you know to the next inquiry to well</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.960" end="00:37:30.270" style="s2">clearly finance and economics are</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.810" end="00:37:33.480" style="s2">completely disconnected from life from</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.270" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">from living systems from our lived</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.480" end="00:37:40.380" style="s2">experience we have to reinvent it and so</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:42.720" style="s2">with our company auto police&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.380" end="00:37:45.090" style="s2">explored you know regenerative ownership</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:46.440" style="s2">models financing models regenerative</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.440" end="00:37:51.089" style="s2">really kind of bringing that weave back</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.510" end="00:37:53.190" style="s2">together and it was you know messy and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.089" end="00:37:55.980" style="s2">complicated you know again and again we</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.190" end="00:38:00.150" style="s2">would literally hit you know divergent</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.980" end="00:38:03.450" style="s2">worldviews finally just so deep you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.150" end="00:38:06.030" style="s2">where you&#39;re just rushing to to get the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.450" end="00:38:08.670" style="s2">final financing how do you talk to a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.030" end="00:38:11.730" style="s2">loan officer that Otto believes us about</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.670" end="00:38:13.410" style="s2">living systems they they they&#39;re happy</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.730" end="00:38:15.869" style="s2">to talk to you about the other benefits</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.410" end="00:38:19.589" style="s2">ecologically and socially but at the end</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.869" end="00:38:21.569" style="s2">of the day they just cannot see beyond</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.589" end="00:38:24.450" style="s2">what they&#39;ve been taught and what they</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.569" end="00:38:26.520" style="s2">just feel so deeply is the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.450" end="00:38:29.130" style="s2">the project which is this line of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.520" end="00:38:31.740" style="s2">numbers and so we played with you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.130" end="00:38:34.680" style="s2">could you create the the economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.740" end="00:38:37.619" style="s2">performance that included ecological and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.680" end="00:38:40.319" style="s2">social value layers and so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.619" end="00:38:42.000" style="s2">without a polices we teamed up with our</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.319" end="00:38:44.609" style="s2">shared colleague Jason twill who&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:46.230" style="s2">based in Australia we launched this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.609" end="00:38:48.690" style="s2">project called the economics of change</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.230" end="00:38:50.819" style="s2">to really work with real estate</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.690" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">investors all kinds of different actors</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.819" end="00:38:57.750" style="s2">in that system to say could we open a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:39:00.540" style="s2">space to layer on economic value social</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.750" end="00:39:03.180" style="s2">ecological value and and begin to</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.540" end="00:39:05.579" style="s2">quantify it and again it&#39;s a it&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.180" end="00:39:08.270" style="s2">epistemological mistake to think you</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.579" end="00:39:11.790" style="s2">could take our lived experience or</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.270" end="00:39:14.069" style="s2">ecological thriving and somehow turn it</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.790" end="00:39:16.109" style="s2">into a series of numbers but we played</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.069" end="00:39:19.970" style="s2">with that we tried to find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.109" end="00:39:21.960" style="s2">communicate you know the the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.970" end="00:39:25.650" style="s2">integrated set of benefits from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.960" end="00:39:27.510" style="s2">regenerative building project and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.650" end="00:39:30.200" style="s2">know did that work for several years and</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.510" end="00:39:34.190" style="s2">again these deep deep worldview</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.200" end="00:39:36.630" style="s2">conflicts where individuals at you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.190" end="00:39:39.540" style="s2">GE Capital and different real estate</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.630" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">firms would totally understand it we</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.540" end="00:39:43.230" style="s2">could talk as individuals they of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:45.050" style="s2">I just went out fishing and I get it I</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.230" end="00:39:48.480" style="s2">love it you know if we could incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.050" end="00:39:51.119" style="s2">ecosystem values we get better buildings</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.480" end="00:39:54.750" style="s2">and yet they couldn&#39;t single-handedly</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:56.460" style="s2">move their company yeah I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.750" end="00:39:57.960" style="s2">funny that you brought up Jason because</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.460" end="00:40:00.059" style="s2">as you were speaking before you</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.960" end="00:40:01.229" style="s2">mentioned him I was thinking how it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.059" end="00:40:04.920" style="s2">parallel between what you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.229" end="00:40:07.829" style="s2">describing in what he was recalling of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.920" end="00:40:09.809" style="s2">his work of trying to transform the big</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.829" end="00:40:12.719" style="s2">players in the build environment in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.809" end="00:40:15.259" style="s2">stream back Olympus and also like my</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.719" end="00:40:18.479" style="s2">conversation would with Bill Reid and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.259" end="00:40:21.660" style="s2">how very often when when Regenesis gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.479" end="00:40:25.650" style="s2">hired for a job and there&#39;s that moment</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.660" end="00:40:29.160" style="s2">where the client doesn&#39;t quite get it</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.650" end="00:40:30.869" style="s2">what they are on about and because what</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.160" end="00:40:33.449" style="s2">they&#39;re really looking is at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.869" end="00:40:36.299" style="s2">finished designed development project</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.449" end="00:40:39.539" style="s2">and the values that they can achieve by</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.299" end="00:40:42.420" style="s2">selling it and in where&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.539" end="00:40:43.769" style="s2">deeper deliverable of working in that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.420" end="00:40:46.199" style="s2">regenerative way is really the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.769" end="00:40:50.069" style="s2">capability of the entire system to self</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.199" end="00:40:52.769" style="s2">manifest from each of the people in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.069" end="00:40:55.979" style="s2">company but all the people they touch in</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.769" end="00:40:58.140" style="s2">the community being lifted to being able</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.979" end="00:41:00.209" style="s2">to manifest their potential through the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.140" end="00:41:03.869" style="s2">process of working in that way and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.209" end="00:41:07.199" style="s2">and and it&#39;s just a complete shift one</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.869" end="00:41:09.150" style="s2">of those kuhnian cubes were he looks all</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.199" end="00:41:11.459" style="s2">very different but it&#39;s the same Cuban</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.150" end="00:41:13.469" style="s2">and most companies still find it very</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.459" end="00:41:15.269" style="s2">hard to make that shift it takes a while</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.469" end="00:41:18.769" style="s2">for them to understand the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.269" end="00:41:21.959" style="s2">significance yes and and the work of her</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.769" end="00:41:25.140" style="s2">genital and profound you know to begin</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.959" end="00:41:28.529" style="s2">to say could the unfolding of a building</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.140" end="00:41:30.150" style="s2">a small development actually lead these</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.529" end="00:41:32.249" style="s2">regenerative capacities being enhanced</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.150" end="00:41:35.160" style="s2">in everybody touching the project in any</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.249" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">way and potentially even creating a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.160" end="00:41:40.319" style="s2">whole ecosystem of organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.920" end="00:41:43.890" style="s2">that&#39;s the level I think where you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.319" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">actually begin to shift the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.890" end="00:41:47.099" style="s2">transactional models the investment the</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:49.739" style="s2">ownership models when you start to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.099" end="00:41:52.709" style="s2">a vibrant ecosystem many many different</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.739" end="00:41:54.839" style="s2">organizations for profits nonprofits</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.709" end="00:41:57.900" style="s2">academic institutions different levels</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.839" end="00:42:00.089" style="s2">of government beginning to perceive with</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.900" end="00:42:02.189" style="s2">a whole system&#39;s perspective beginning</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.089" end="00:42:06.059" style="s2">to have this regenerative impulse and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.189" end="00:42:09.179" style="s2">this shared sense could we unfold this</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.059" end="00:42:13.600" style="s2">potential together and and that that can</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.179" end="00:42:15.850" style="s2">happen in a nested scales how did you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.600" end="00:42:17.470" style="s2">with John and make that move over to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.850" end="00:42:19.330" style="s2">Capitol Institute then because I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.470" end="00:42:21.430" style="s2">many ways that&#39;s that&#39;s the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.330" end="00:42:24.280" style="s2">your work now but you&#39;re now working</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.430" end="00:42:26.080" style="s2">with all these initiatives within the</p>

<p begin="00:42:26.080" end="00:42:30.250" style="s2">people have come together saying yes we</p>

<p begin="00:42:30.250" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">do this kind of work is at the bio</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.600" end="00:42:39.550" style="s2">regional level its homed in on that work</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ve been thinking about this by</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.550" end="00:42:43.360" style="s2">regional transformation process ever</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.730" style="s2">since the control phase you know looking</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.360" end="00:42:49.300" style="s2">really practically at sama nation right</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.730" end="00:42:51.850" style="s2">so one very large beautiful by a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.300" end="00:42:54.180" style="s2">culturally diverse region and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.850" end="00:42:56.770" style="s2">what you know what could we do to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.180" end="00:42:58.960" style="s2">systemically rewire the economy there in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.770" end="00:43:03.010" style="s2">build that sort of capacity and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.960" end="00:43:05.020" style="s2">early days and rough experiments and now</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.010" end="00:43:07.030" style="s2">you know revisiting in the light of just</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.020" end="00:43:09.490" style="s2">incredible work that&#39;s happened you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.030" end="00:43:11.650" style="s2">for decades now and we you know starting</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.490" end="00:43:13.480" style="s2">with sustainability moving to resilience</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.650" end="00:43:16.770" style="s2">moving to regeneration it&#39;s all it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.480" end="00:43:20.440" style="s2">a huge weave and increasingly these</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.770" end="00:43:23.260" style="s2">words these movements can become</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.440" end="00:43:25.360" style="s2">something much deeper differentiated</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.260" end="00:43:27.600" style="s2">still perhaps but working very</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.360" end="00:43:30.100" style="s2">powerfully together with self-awareness</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.600" end="00:43:32.320" style="s2">in a similar way to working with three</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.100" end="00:43:34.210" style="s2">horizons gives you coherent ways to</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.320" end="00:43:37.780" style="s2">think about different timescales and</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.210" end="00:43:41.950" style="s2">strategies for action so if we think</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.780" end="00:43:43.990" style="s2">about capital Institute&#39;s work in</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.950" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">regenerative economics they launched in</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.990" end="00:43:49.050" style="s2">2010 I sort of found them very early</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:52.050" style="s2">oddly what is this this is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.050" end="00:43:54.550" style="s2">because almost no one was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.050" end="00:43:56.470" style="s2">regenerative economics or really</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.550" end="00:43:59.230" style="s2">thinking about deep economic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.470" end="00:44:02.050" style="s2">financial systems region design from the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.230" end="00:44:03.700" style="s2">perspective of living systems and so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.050" end="00:44:08.170" style="s2">was following that work I met John</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.700" end="00:44:11.590" style="s2">around 2013 we talked a lot we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.170" end="00:44:15.880" style="s2">few projects together and then the time</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.590" end="00:44:17.860" style="s2">was right in 2017 to say look could we</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.880" end="00:44:20.230" style="s2">take the thought leadership work</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.860" end="00:44:22.270" style="s2">John&#39;s pivotal 2015 paper on</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.230" end="00:44:23.830" style="s2">regenerative capitalism some wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.270" end="00:44:26.020" style="s2">storytelling work that had be done and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.830" end="00:44:26.870" style="s2">really say what would this mean on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.020" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">ground</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.870" end="00:44:33.290" style="s2">right how could we and manage and design</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:36.530" style="s2">a process for unfolding a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.290" end="00:44:39.500" style="s2">economy at a large landscape at a by a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.530" end="00:44:41.750" style="s2">regional scale what would that process</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.500" end="00:44:44.540" style="s2">look like how can we nurture it how can</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.750" end="00:44:46.370" style="s2">we feed it how can we support it and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.540" end="00:44:47.840" style="s2">we we kind of drew on meg Wheatley&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.370" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">wonderful work on on what she calls</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.840" end="00:44:51.650" style="s2">emergent networks so this is very</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.920" style="s2">different then oh yeah we you know there</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.650" end="00:44:57.470" style="s2">are 10 or 15 well-defined projects and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.920" end="00:44:59.390" style="s2">we just set up a trade association and</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.470" end="00:45:00.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a nice way to to communicate and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.390" end="00:45:02.450" style="s2">move things forward</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.260" end="00:45:04.580" style="s2">this was a bit different because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.450" end="00:45:08.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know of any buyer regions</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.580" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">on this path and so we kind of put up a</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.840" end="00:45:15.290" style="s2">flare and said ok here&#39;s a here&#39;s a just</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:17.240" style="s2">a light of is anybody interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.290" end="00:45:20.030" style="s2">journey is anybody on this journey does</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.240" end="00:45:21.980" style="s2">this even make sense and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.030" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">been the spirit it&#39;s when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.980" end="00:45:26.390" style="s2">do an emergent network you try to give</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:30.050" style="s2">it the loose as possible kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.390" end="00:45:32.000" style="s2">organizing integrity and in our case we</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.050" end="00:45:33.560" style="s2">said look would you be interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.000" end="00:45:35.300" style="s2">kind of experimenting with say</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.560" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">principles of regenerative economics and</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.300" end="00:45:41.240" style="s2">regeneration more broadly and we flew up</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:44.060" style="s2">that flare and started to get some</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.240" end="00:45:45.530" style="s2">enquiries you know ok this this is very</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.060" end="00:45:47.630" style="s2">interesting you know some of us have</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.530" end="00:45:49.190" style="s2">been thinking about this some</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.630" end="00:45:53.990" style="s2">organizations are interested and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.190" end="00:45:55.880" style="s2">forth and so we now have interest that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.990" end="00:45:57.650" style="s2">we can&#39;t possibly address there are just</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.880" end="00:45:59.480" style="s2">dozens of by regions around the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.650" end="00:46:03.140" style="s2">that would want to play and be connected</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.480" end="00:46:05.060" style="s2">with it so for now Dania we have 15 by</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.140" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">regions on four continents a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.060" end="00:46:11.480" style="s2">activity in Costa Rica Colombia Brazil</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.690" style="s2">the United States and Canada</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.480" end="00:46:20.750" style="s2">lovely project in the UK and South Devon</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.690" end="00:46:21.710" style="s2">and then the park the idea is to learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.750" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">from each other</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.710" end="00:46:27.230" style="s2">so bioregion to bioregion pure learning</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:30.380" style="s2">to support this kind of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.230" end="00:46:32.780" style="s2">unfolding app by regional scale and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.380" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">starts with kind of some early energy a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.780" end="00:46:36.440" style="s2">strong enough team strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:39.620" style="s2">capacity to say yes we can anchor this</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.440" end="00:46:40.579" style="s2">long term so that could be a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.620" end="00:46:42.439" style="s2">people in organizing</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.579" end="00:46:47.170" style="s2">ideally from very diverse sectors</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.439" end="00:46:49.459" style="s2">perspectives very deep and hopefully not</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.170" end="00:46:51.499" style="s2">completely overlapping networks of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.459" end="00:46:54.109" style="s2">connection and then picture it like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.499" end="00:46:57.019" style="s2">within a bio region you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.109" end="00:46:59.420" style="s2">grow a mycelium of regeneration a</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.019" end="00:47:02.059" style="s2">mycelial a fungal root network of</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.420" end="00:47:03.619" style="s2">regeneration so it&#39;s not about a</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.059" end="00:47:04.999" style="s2">scorecard and sort of you&#39;re in you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.619" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">out I&#39;ll work with you or not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.999" end="00:47:10.369" style="s2">wherever those hyphae wherever those</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:12.979" style="s2">mycelial root tips right can connect and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.369" end="00:47:14.809" style="s2">say ah nutrients can flow here we may</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.979" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">not quite understand each other yet but</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.809" end="00:47:19.309" style="s2">we&#39;re finding a way to work for</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:22.189" style="s2">generatively where we can go deep and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.309" end="00:47:25.130" style="s2">begin to connect with each other&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.189" end="00:47:27.969" style="s2">and connection and intention and not be</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.130" end="00:47:31.369" style="s2">thrown off by words and frameworks and</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.969" end="00:47:33.499" style="s2">just cognitive thinking actually dropped</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.369" end="00:47:35.829" style="s2">down a few levels to really blob love of</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.499" end="00:47:39.199" style="s2">what Otto Shermer would call presencing</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.829" end="00:47:42.739" style="s2">you drop to that level and begin to</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.199" end="00:47:46.339" style="s2">unfold prototypes and possibilities from</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.739" end="00:47:49.130" style="s2">that deep level of shared field of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.339" end="00:47:51.199" style="s2">beginning to map and sense and and see</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.130" end="00:47:55.239" style="s2">from a living systems perspective from a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.199" end="00:47:59.089" style="s2">full systems perspective so practically</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.239" end="00:48:00.739" style="s2">in different regions in in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.089" end="00:48:02.569" style="s2">regenerative communities network you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.739" end="00:48:05.029" style="s2">got this weaving happen so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.569" end="00:48:06.920" style="s2">all of these different organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.029" end="00:48:08.539" style="s2">individuals beginning to connect</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.920" end="00:48:10.699" style="s2">together find each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.539" end="00:48:13.219" style="s2">launch initiatives in a very flexible</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.699" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">decentralized way and we feel that our</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.219" end="00:48:19.489" style="s2">role is to support eight key dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:21.619" style="s2">of regenerative infrastructure and these</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.489" end="00:48:23.929" style="s2">have been kind of Co identified and</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.619" end="00:48:25.999" style="s2">co-created with the network so again as</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.929" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">an emergent network we didn&#39;t quite know</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.999" end="00:48:29.689" style="s2">what would be most helpful and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:31.789" style="s2">we&#39;ve sort of converged on for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.689" end="00:48:35.959" style="s2">moment and this will continue to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.789" end="00:48:40.009" style="s2">is kind of eight areas eight dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.959" end="00:48:42.769" style="s2">that can support this mycelial growth so</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.009" end="00:48:45.019" style="s2">education do they as well they don&#39;t map</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.769" end="00:48:48.289" style="s2">against the eight qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.019" end="00:48:51.199" style="s2">regenerative economics that correct</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.289" end="00:48:53.880" style="s2">correct so the the eight principles give</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.199" end="00:48:55.650" style="s2">us what we call a nice</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.880" end="00:48:57.990" style="s2">calling them qualities in the last</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.650" end="00:49:00.090" style="s2">conversation with John John is Swit</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.990" end="00:49:03.150" style="s2">switching to calling them qualities as</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.090" end="00:49:05.070" style="s2">well I like that I like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.150" end="00:49:06.840" style="s2">Christopher Alexander actually played</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.070" end="00:49:08.910" style="s2">with that and decided to use qualities</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.840" end="00:49:11.490" style="s2">or in fact he called them properties</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.910" end="00:49:15.450" style="s2">they identified 15 properties of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.490" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">wholeness that are quite profound so yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.450" end="00:49:21.060" style="s2">if we think about the v8 you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:23.820" style="s2">qualities of a regenerative economy that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.060" end="00:49:25.890" style="s2">gives us kind of a North Star a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.820" end="00:49:28.200" style="s2">for the work so we&#39;re trying to explore</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.890" end="00:49:31.080" style="s2">together move towards achieving those</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.200" end="00:49:34.290" style="s2">principles as interpreted by that</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.080" end="00:49:36.060" style="s2">particular bio cultural context what I</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.290" end="00:49:39.120" style="s2">love about those qualities is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.060" end="00:49:40.890" style="s2">they&#39;re generative so I think John</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.120" end="00:49:45.720" style="s2">really designed them in a way that would</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.890" end="00:49:49.170" style="s2">enable deep inquiry open up you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.720" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">right kinds of questions versus just</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.170" end="00:49:53.240" style="s2">very cut and dried</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:58.170" style="s2">you know more technical principles there</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.240" end="00:50:01.140" style="s2">you look at you were just about to yes</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.170" end="00:50:03.360" style="s2">and you named education which which</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.140" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">which one of the qualities of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.360" end="00:50:09.780" style="s2">regenerative economists do you see</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:12.360" style="s2">education match to so right so so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.780" end="00:50:14.280" style="s2">qualities of a regenerative economy</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.360" end="00:50:16.980" style="s2">include things like being in right</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.280" end="00:50:19.980" style="s2">relationship or encouraging adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:22.890" style="s2">and innovation or edge effect abundance</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.980" end="00:50:25.350" style="s2">where you&#39;re kind of mycelium anaphoras</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.890" end="00:50:27.810" style="s2">literally you&#39;ve got one big mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.350" end="00:50:29.400" style="s2">here another one over here what happens</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.810" end="00:50:31.050" style="s2">when they begin to connect and you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.400" end="00:50:34.320" style="s2">this unexpected nutrient flow between</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.050" end="00:50:36.900" style="s2">them so that&#39;s kind of the overall</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.320" end="00:50:40.140" style="s2">guiding purpose but then how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.900" end="00:50:42.330" style="s2">the work and of course they&#39;re deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.140" end="00:50:46.830" style="s2">qualities of being underneath all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.330" end="00:50:48.900" style="s2">this and that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole other way</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.830" end="00:50:52.170" style="s2">to think about the work but there are</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.900" end="00:50:54.690" style="s2">eight dimensions of just practically</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.170" end="00:50:57.090" style="s2">getting on with it and those include</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.690" end="00:50:59.340" style="s2">your regenerative education so</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.090" end="00:51:00.690" style="s2">everything from gene thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.340" end="00:51:02.100" style="s2">regenerate world these do all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.690" end="00:51:05.550" style="s2">practical so those happen you actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.100" end="00:51:08.310" style="s2">do agroforestry how do you create a food</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.550" end="00:51:10.470" style="s2">forest garden right how do you do marine</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.310" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">or restoration and regeneration all of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.470" end="00:51:16.740" style="s2">those kinds of things transformative</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">leadership so how do you actually become</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.740" end="00:51:21.750" style="s2">what we call a systems convener how do</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:25.290" style="s2">you work in a by regional context or any</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.750" end="00:51:29.150" style="s2">context in a way that unfolds potential</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.290" end="00:51:32.930" style="s2">which creates a sense of possibility and</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.150" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">coherence so education leadership</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.930" end="00:51:37.110" style="s2">narrative framing very important so</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:39.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the third one</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.110" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">storytelling and capital Institute</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.960" end="00:51:43.170" style="s2">actually did a lot of beautiful work</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:45.510" style="s2">that was captured in what we call the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.170" end="00:51:47.160" style="s2">field guide to regenerative economy so</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.510" end="00:51:50.520" style="s2">50 case studies of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.160" end="00:51:53.220" style="s2">enterprises from the US and in other</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.520" end="00:51:55.250" style="s2">parts of the world so so storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.220" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">narrative you know being able to really</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.250" end="00:52:00.980" style="s2">story this within a region to know you</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:04.260" style="s2">know these these sort of sparks are</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.980" end="00:52:06.810" style="s2">happening and connecting and doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.260" end="00:52:09.450" style="s2">learning journeys around those the</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.810" end="00:52:11.100" style="s2">fourth one is having a platform for</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.450" end="00:52:13.470" style="s2">collaboration and communication and</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.100" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve experimented with one so a digital</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.470" end="00:52:18.060" style="s2">platform that is called hive bright it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:20.670" style="s2">fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.060" end="00:52:22.680" style="s2">and there&#39;s a real deep art to actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.670" end="00:52:24.690" style="s2">curating a digital community and we</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.680" end="00:52:27.210" style="s2">haven&#39;t solved that as a network I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.690" end="00:52:29.430" style="s2">talking to many other people like David</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.210" end="00:52:31.140" style="s2">Hudson and Steve Waddell with SDG</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.430" end="00:52:33.180" style="s2">transformations form we&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.140" end="00:52:36.360" style="s2">wrestling with half math you digitally</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.180" end="00:52:38.970" style="s2">hold this work I mean because because I</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.360" end="00:52:41.370" style="s2">mean I signed up for that platform and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.970" end="00:52:44.850" style="s2">recently I reengaged with it and it just</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.370" end="00:52:47.190" style="s2">felt like it hasn&#39;t really caught up</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.850" end="00:52:49.110" style="s2">like to a point where there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.190" end="00:52:53.070" style="s2">conversation going on like I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.110" end="00:52:54.930" style="s2">surprised to having like felt bad that I</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.070" end="00:52:58.080" style="s2">hadn&#39;t dropped in for maybe three months</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.930" end="00:53:00.270" style="s2">and then I realized that not that much</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.080" end="00:53:03.210" style="s2">and had actually been going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.270" end="00:53:05.790" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t find it I know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.210" end="00:53:08.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a fine art to you know on</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.790" end="00:53:10.680" style="s2">boarding a digital community feeding it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.010" end="00:53:12.630" style="s2">curating having people engaged and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.680" end="00:53:15.240" style="s2">just not something we&#39;ve been able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.630" end="00:53:17.220" style="s2">put sufficient focus to so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.240" end="00:53:19.380" style="s2">happened is in the different bioregions</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.220" end="00:53:21.780" style="s2">they&#39;re all evolving their own multiple</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.380" end="00:53:23.700" style="s2">platforms and websites</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.780" end="00:53:25.800" style="s2">you know whatsapp channels and on and on</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.700" end="00:53:28.260" style="s2">and on and so it&#39;s cobbled together and</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.800" end="00:53:30.930" style="s2">we don&#39;t have enough visibility right if</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.260" end="00:53:32.820" style="s2">we had a shared platform that could</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.930" end="00:53:34.260" style="s2">connect the work effectively it would</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.820" end="00:53:37.770" style="s2">make all of the work visible and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.260" end="00:53:39.480" style="s2">forth so we&#39;re in conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.770" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">other networks just in the same place</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.480" end="00:53:45.210" style="s2">every once we&#39;ve got platform fatigue</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:47.250" style="s2">right it just it&#39;s too hard to have one</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.210" end="00:53:49.410" style="s2">more place to engage doodle digitally so</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.250" end="00:53:52.380" style="s2">we&#39;re realizing we&#39;ve gone back to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.410" end="00:53:55.290" style="s2">actually the soft networks in place are</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.380" end="00:53:59.040" style="s2">by far the most important the people</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.290" end="00:54:00.900" style="s2">that are you know consciously meeting</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.040" end="00:54:03.180" style="s2">connecting doing things together in</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.900" end="00:54:05.880" style="s2">person walking the land together doing a</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.180" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">learning journey you know launching long</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.880" end="00:54:10.290" style="s2">term collaborative that nothing can</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:13.740" style="s2">replace that level of communication and</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.290" end="00:54:16.800" style="s2">collaboration so then to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.740" end="00:54:18.870" style="s2">complete you know those eight layers so</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.800" end="00:54:21.300" style="s2">all of that is kind of sensing into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.870" end="00:54:24.240" style="s2">system and and supporting some of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.300" end="00:54:27.270" style="s2">key capacities to to do the work then</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.240" end="00:54:30.780" style="s2">you need real ways to do systems mapping</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.270" end="00:54:34.160" style="s2">to really understand geospatially right</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.780" end="00:54:39.360" style="s2">the layers the water layers and energy</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:41.850" style="s2">metabolic flows of materials associate</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.360" end="00:54:44.190" style="s2">economic layers but then more</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.850" end="00:54:46.320" style="s2">importantly causal system dynamics so</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.190" end="00:54:48.900" style="s2">really using something like Kumu to do</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.320" end="00:54:51.770" style="s2">deep systems mapping around power</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.900" end="00:54:56.940" style="s2">relations causality within the region</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.770" end="00:54:59.400" style="s2">but then other layers so our colleague</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.940" end="00:55:01.890" style="s2">Glenn Page is doing amazing work on what</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.400" end="00:55:04.590" style="s2">he calls transformation system analysis</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.890" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">and map it so literally try and</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.590" end="00:55:09.240" style="s2">understand those key notable</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:12.870" style="s2">intervention points leverage points in</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.240" end="00:55:15.150" style="s2">the system and developing the fine art</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.870" end="00:55:17.340" style="s2">of actually mapping and communicating</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.150" end="00:55:21.270" style="s2">that together and it&#39;s an emerging field</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.340" end="00:55:23.160" style="s2">and in hosting a working group around</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.270" end="00:55:25.230" style="s2">transformation system analysis because</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.160" end="00:55:26.790" style="s2">no one no one quite can do it yet in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.230" end="00:55:30.060" style="s2">practice we&#39;ve got some tantalizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.790" end="00:55:32.590" style="s2">clues I need to get in touch with them</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.060" end="00:55:35.170" style="s2">because I would love for him to run</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.590" end="00:55:37.600" style="s2">that fledging process against the ten</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.170" end="00:55:39.720" style="s2">years of work and the network that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.600" end="00:55:42.490" style="s2">established here on New Yorker and and</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.720" end="00:55:44.520" style="s2">to see whether it would give any</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.490" end="00:55:47.110" style="s2">insights on how to particularly now that</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.520" end="00:55:51.340" style="s2">the tourism is dead in the water</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.110" end="00:55:53.770" style="s2">and after the pandemic there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.340" end="00:55:57.420" style="s2">now compared to when when you came in</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.770" end="00:55:59.920" style="s2">visited here and like the whole</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.420" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">positioning that I was doing of trying</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.920" end="00:56:06.360" style="s2">to convince tourism to be the economic</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:08.040" style="s2">engine of paying for the re</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.360" end="00:56:10.690" style="s2">regionalization and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.040" end="00:56:12.670" style="s2">regenerative process at the the island</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.690" end="00:56:16.050" style="s2">scale is now not really an option</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.670" end="00:56:21.550" style="s2">anymore and so it&#39;s gonna be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.050" end="00:56:24.300" style="s2">yeah yeah so yeah exactly so so that</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.550" end="00:56:28.390" style="s2">systems mapping flows very naturally</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.300" end="00:56:30.430" style="s2">into design and planning at by original</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.390" end="00:56:32.800" style="s2">scale which I know you&#39;ve been deeply</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.430" end="00:56:34.780" style="s2">involved with worked on guy education</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.800" end="00:56:38.200" style="s2">courses around it&#39;s an emerging</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.780" end="00:56:40.990" style="s2">discipline taking regenerative design</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.200" end="00:56:43.660" style="s2">approaches things Regenesis group has</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.990" end="00:56:45.580" style="s2">pioneered with storage place but than</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.660" end="00:56:48.010" style="s2">many other practitioners and fields</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.580" end="00:56:49.720" style="s2">there is a very profound field of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.010" end="00:56:50.370" style="s2">regional planning pioneered by Ian</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.720" end="00:56:54.790" style="s2">McHarg</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.370" end="00:56:56.710" style="s2">and and so kind of weaving together some</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.790" end="00:56:59.620" style="s2">very deep thinking from Landscape</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.710" end="00:57:01.420" style="s2">Architecture regional planning but then</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.620" end="00:57:03.550" style="s2">saying it&#39;s not just the land planting</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.420" end="00:57:06.610" style="s2">right it&#39;s deeply understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.550" end="00:57:08.470" style="s2">economic transformation the social and</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.610" end="00:57:10.030" style="s2">cultural factors and as you would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.470" end="00:57:12.340" style="s2">it&#39;s really how do we design a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.030" end="00:57:13.740" style="s2">regenerative culture for that bio region</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.340" end="00:57:16.900" style="s2">and of course in the completely</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.740" end="00:57:19.420" style="s2">collaborative way and then in a way it</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.900" end="00:57:21.460" style="s2">isn&#39;t just cultures on the side the it</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.420" end="00:57:23.950" style="s2">is enacting regenerative culture it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.460" end="00:57:26.380" style="s2">enacting a regenerative bio region which</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.950" end="00:57:30.070" style="s2">means you&#39;ve got to reground rewire all</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.380" end="00:57:31.480" style="s2">the economic activity and you rewiring</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.070" end="00:57:33.160" style="s2">the built environments you&#39;re rewiring</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.480" end="00:57:36.790" style="s2">social relations and so forth and</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.160" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">finding this adaptive deep fit over time</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.790" end="00:57:42.760" style="s2">but in many cases relies on traditional</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:45.460" style="s2">ecological knowledge traditional ways of</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.760" end="00:57:46.440" style="s2">knowing so the cycle then gets very</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.460" end="00:57:49.380" style="s2">practical</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.440" end="00:57:53.880" style="s2">mapping just signing and planning</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.380" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">evaluating and the network has adopted a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.880" end="00:57:59.880" style="s2">very beautiful approach called Blue</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:03.089" style="s2">Marble evaluation which was developed by</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.880" end="00:58:04.589" style="s2">Michael Quinn Patton who is a global</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.089" end="00:58:06.749" style="s2">leader in this sort of field of how do</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.589" end="00:58:09.269" style="s2">you know how do you evaluate and assess</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.749" end="00:58:11.190" style="s2">projects of all types and it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.269" end="00:58:14.220" style="s2">Blue Marble because you have that image</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.190" end="00:58:18.599" style="s2">of the earth you know floating in space</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.220" end="00:58:21.539" style="s2">so your evaluation is literally is this</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.599" end="00:58:25.170" style="s2">going to be transformative at different</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.539" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">scales in a way that will help us shift</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.170" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">to a thriving gyein system finally it</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:47.190" style="s2">was one of the last books to arrive</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.599" end="00:58:49.259" style="s2">before the started and so so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.190" end="00:58:52.349" style="s2">really kind of a test case within the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.259" end="00:58:54.150" style="s2">RCM for Blue Marble to really look at a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.349" end="00:58:57.089" style="s2">by regional scale where you have this</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.150" end="00:59:00.839" style="s2">rich complexity so if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.089" end="00:59:03.150" style="s2">assess how well you&#39;re doing in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.839" end="00:59:06.539" style="s2">governance and what they call the</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.150" end="00:59:08.999" style="s2">mailing conditions for long terms</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.539" end="00:59:10.920" style="s2">sustained regenerative process you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.999" end="00:59:12.950" style="s2">actually assess that qualitatively and</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.920" end="00:59:15.150" style="s2">you can even get to some very simple</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.950" end="00:59:17.220" style="s2">quantitative metrics when that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.150" end="00:59:19.529" style="s2">but from this sense not of so any</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.220" end="00:59:21.569" style="s2">surface thing like oh yeah our water</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.529" end="00:59:23.849" style="s2">quality was slightly better in this you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.569" end="00:59:25.710" style="s2">know sub hydrological basin you know or</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.849" end="00:59:29.279" style="s2">co2 slightly better in this building</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.710" end="00:59:32.099" style="s2">those are important but this is deep do</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.279" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">we have long-term conditions that will</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.099" end="00:59:38.999" style="s2">enable the learning the transformation</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:40.529" style="s2">to occur and so we&#39;re just testing us</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.999" end="00:59:41.640" style="s2">now we&#39;re just kind of co-creating with</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.529" end="00:59:44.220" style="s2">different bioregions</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.640" end="00:59:45.239" style="s2">how would you do a baseline write to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.220" end="00:59:47.819" style="s2">here&#39;s where we are on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.239" end="00:59:50.279" style="s2">transformational process as we start in</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.819" end="00:59:52.259" style="s2">a place like my Orca here are things</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.279" end="00:59:53.789" style="s2">that we can tell immediately will be</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.259" end="00:59:54.989" style="s2">weaknesses as we begin our</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.789" end="00:59:56.609" style="s2">transformational process will</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.989" end="00:59:58.680" style="s2">immediately begin to address those will</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.609" end="00:59:59.759" style="s2">build deeper and deeper information</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.680" end="01:00:03.059" style="s2">flows collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.759" end="01:00:06.089" style="s2">processes ways of understanding together</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.059" end="01:00:09.389" style="s2">how to continuously adapt our work and</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.089" end="01:00:11.489" style="s2">then it connects of course to capital so</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.389" end="01:00:13.769" style="s2">at the end of the day if we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.489" end="01:00:15.869" style="s2">rewire these by regional economies so</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.769" end="01:00:18.539" style="s2">that literally they are regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.869" end="01:00:20.429" style="s2">economy so that the flows the ownership</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.539" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">patterns to the the inclusivity the</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.429" end="01:00:25.979" style="s2">ability to participate really</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:28.109" style="s2">regenerative then we&#39;ve got a shift the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.979" end="01:00:30.179" style="s2">investment within the by region and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.109" end="01:00:32.939" style="s2">need to decarbonize we need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.179" end="01:00:36.089" style="s2">regenerate land we need to create</p>

<p begin="01:00:38.849" end="01:00:43.259" style="s2">disperse to the very edges and</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.739" end="01:00:45.149" style="s2">distribute out throughout the bio region</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.259" end="01:00:47.069" style="s2">rather than being highly centralized</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.149" end="01:00:50.789" style="s2">typically in powerful urban centers how</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.069" end="01:00:53.399" style="s2">do we have prosperity one of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.789" end="01:00:56.309" style="s2">dilemmas that I see or the the real</p>

<p begin="01:11:56.450" end="01:12:02.540" style="s2">we can story that right we ought to</p>

<p begin="01:22:35.600" end="01:22:39.140" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it in that way which is</p>

<p begin="01:22:44.690" end="01:22:49.730" style="s2">such a thing be mapped out so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:50.900" style="s2">experimenting with this in Costa Rica so</p>

<p begin="01:22:57.590" end="01:23:01.280" style="s2">roadmap look like for Costa Rica how</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.990" end="01:23:04.250" style="s2">could that inform efforts in New Zealand</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.280" end="01:23:06.470" style="s2">other parts of the Commonwealth we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.250" end="01:23:07.940" style="s2">hearing you know kind of murmurings that</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.470" end="01:23:09.410" style="s2">Iceland might do such a thing in</p>

<p begin="01:23:09.410" end="01:23:13.400" style="s2">economy Alliance so this is another</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.300" end="01:23:16.070" style="s2">really interesting scale of regeneration</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.400" end="01:23:17.720" style="s2">that&#39;s emerging I think Daniel where we</p>

<p begin="01:23:17.720" end="01:23:22.220" style="s2">network we&#39;ve been really focused on bio</p>

<p begin="01:23:28.810" end="01:23:35.840" style="s2">but nations tend to have somewhat</p>

<p begin="01:23:38.180" end="01:23:42.950" style="s2">typically what you what you go to the UN</p>

<p begin="01:23:51.830" end="01:23:57.680" style="s2">Iceland&#39;s Costa Rica&#39;s relatively small</p>

<p begin="01:24:02.750" end="01:24:06.620" style="s2">yeah you could have every single bio</p>

<p begin="01:24:12.050" end="01:24:16.850" style="s2">you then kind of roll up and say well</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.760" end="01:24:19.249" style="s2">that becomes an integrated way we go up</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.850" end="01:24:21.440" style="s2">and down scales from water</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.249" end="01:24:23.449" style="s2">by Regent optimation and back down and</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.440" end="01:24:25.519" style="s2">as we have a handful of these nations</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.449" end="01:24:28.070" style="s2">saying yes we&#39;re charting out a very</p>

<p begin="01:24:28.070" end="01:24:34.460" style="s2">you have another model at the UN level</p>

<p begin="01:24:34.460" end="01:24:41.239" style="s2">do so many other things as well whether</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.489" end="01:24:54.559" style="s2">now it&#39;s four years and I really felt</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.880" end="01:27:13.120" style="s2">just learning to be human</p>

<p begin="01:27:51.580" end="01:27:58.670" style="s2">just thought of it beautiful no this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.550" end="01:28:00.440" style="s2">it&#39;s entirely aligned with um you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.670" end="01:28:03.950" style="s2">the guy that I like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:28:09.770" end="01:28:17.120" style="s2">years and we had a conversation in which</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.110" end="01:28:21.620" style="s2">um similar like that just emerged out of</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.120" end="01:28:22.790" style="s2">you this this this this idea of really</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.620" end="01:28:26.870" style="s2">at the essence of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.790" end="01:28:29.000" style="s2">life is a regenerative community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.870" end="01:28:30.980" style="s2">what like if we want to say how does</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.000" end="01:28:33.920" style="s2">life create conditions to conducive to</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.980" end="01:28:36.290" style="s2">life well life is not a bunch of</p>

<p begin="01:28:36.290" end="01:28:41.090" style="s2">is a planetary process that makes the</p>

<p begin="01:28:41.090" end="01:28:46.520" style="s2">be more to generate more abundance what</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.970" end="01:28:49.160" style="s2">adversity and keep integrating</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.520" end="01:28:50.890" style="s2">diversity and abundance predominantly</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.160" end="01:28:53.540" style="s2">through collaborative processes</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.890" end="01:28:55.160" style="s2">competition is just sort of fine-tuning</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.540" end="01:28:58.180" style="s2">around the edges they&#39;re the real</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.160" end="01:29:00.350" style="s2">process of life is symbiosis and</p>

<p begin="01:29:00.350" end="01:29:05.600" style="s2">and in many ways learning to be human in</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.140" end="01:29:09.830" style="s2">a more than human world is another way</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.600" end="01:29:12.290" style="s2">of saying how do we fit into that more</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.830" end="01:29:14.780" style="s2">than human community of life and how</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.290" end="01:29:16.880" style="s2">will we fit into that pattern of</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.780" end="01:29:19.970" style="s2">creating conditions conducive to life so</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.880" end="01:29:31.100" style="s2">beautiful I love it a perfect place to</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.970" end="01:29:33.260" style="s2">end I need to wrap this has been so</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.100" end="01:29:36.500" style="s2">lovely and I just I just want to finish</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.260" end="01:29:39.830" style="s2">with a couple of thoughts when we think</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.500" end="01:29:42.830" style="s2">about my original regeneration we can</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.830" end="01:29:44.450" style="s2">also engage even with large companies I</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.830" end="01:29:46.790" style="s2">don&#39;t want to leave the impression that</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.450" end="01:29:48.650" style="s2">this is strictly about real okha lysing</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.790" end="01:29:51.140" style="s2">everything and here we might differ</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.650" end="01:29:53.480" style="s2">slightly which is fine but if we engage</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.140" end="01:29:55.670" style="s2">a large company we&#39;re saying that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.480" end="01:29:59.390" style="s2">starting inquiry would be what would it</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.670" end="01:30:02.810" style="s2">mean for all of your activities across</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.390" end="01:30:05.600" style="s2">your office&#39;s your supply chain</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.810" end="01:30:08.120" style="s2">your whole vendor ecosystem all of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.600" end="01:30:10.010" style="s2">to be regenerative and that ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.120" end="01:30:11.960" style="s2">will land you in all the different</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.010" end="01:30:14.210" style="s2">bioregions and places where it has a</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.960" end="01:30:16.640" style="s2">footprint so imagine a company on a</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.210" end="01:30:19.010" style="s2">regenerative journey that actually works</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.640" end="01:30:22.730" style="s2">in a way that we talked about they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.010" end="01:30:23.930" style="s2">read that might work recently where you</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.730" end="01:30:26.060" style="s2">know you&#39;re trying to build regenerative</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.930" end="01:30:28.910" style="s2">capacity through that process so imagine</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.060" end="01:30:30.560" style="s2">a large company actually having all of</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.910" end="01:30:32.600" style="s2">its employees begin to be under new</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.560" end="01:30:34.790" style="s2">generative jury buddy they&#39;re touching</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.600" end="01:30:37.310" style="s2">and connecting with all across their</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.790" end="01:30:39.350" style="s2">whole footprint and such a company might</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.310" end="01:30:42.020" style="s2">realize it might make a lot more sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.350" end="01:30:44.650" style="s2">to be much more by regional and have you</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.020" end="01:30:47.630" style="s2">know highly localized circular economy</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.650" end="01:30:52.640" style="s2">processes you know much more place-based</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.630" end="01:30:54.350" style="s2">forms of manufacturing but there might</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.640" end="01:30:57.200" style="s2">still be some things irons not that</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.350" end="01:30:59.720" style="s2">prevalent you know in most bio regions</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.200" end="01:31:00.649" style="s2">it&#39;s probably a good idea to trade a bit</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.720" end="01:31:02.510" style="s2">of iron rather</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.649" end="01:31:04.340" style="s2">in extracting it in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.510" end="01:31:08.209" style="s2">destructive in a certain region so</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.340" end="01:31:10.849" style="s2">instead of an economy of scale or you</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.209" end="01:31:14.409" style="s2">know comparative advantage what if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.849" end="01:31:18.169" style="s2">about regenerative advantage you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.409" end="01:31:22.369" style="s2">under the materials and processes happen</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.169" end="01:31:24.379" style="s2">in certain ways to you know to minimize</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.369" end="01:31:25.879" style="s2">any any negative impact and those</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.379" end="01:31:28.999" style="s2">inspire regions don&#39;t have to even</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.879" end="01:31:30.739" style="s2">address that so that&#39;s with you I mean</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.999" end="01:31:33.679" style="s2">that basically the work that I did with</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.739" end="01:31:36.499" style="s2">a cover yeah two thousand thirteen</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.679" end="01:31:39.860" style="s2">fourteen fifteen using my York as a as</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.499" end="01:31:42.019" style="s2">an example and they liked the beauty was</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.860" end="01:31:45.199" style="s2">the tomtom and the long-range innovation</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.019" end="01:31:47.840" style="s2">manager of ekkuva was entirely in in the</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.199" end="01:31:49.699" style="s2">spirit of let&#39;s just try to do it in</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.840" end="01:31:52.219" style="s2">order to learn from it not in order to</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.699" end="01:31:53.749" style="s2">necessarily succeed and we were</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.219" end="01:31:56.510" style="s2">basically asking the questions could we</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.749" end="01:31:59.149" style="s2">use waste streams on majorca to produce</p>

<p begin="01:32:01.780" end="01:32:08.360" style="s2">using a multinational well-established</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.919" end="01:32:10.639" style="s2">ecological detergent company like ekkuva</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.360" end="01:32:13.039" style="s2">as a knowledge partner that would then</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.639" end="01:32:15.019" style="s2">actually create and we did to some</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.039" end="01:32:16.489" style="s2">extent just that little project despite</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.019" end="01:32:19.879" style="s2">the fact that eventually it stopped</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.489" end="01:32:22.309" style="s2">being funded and our process was</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.879" end="01:32:25.669" style="s2">engaging the local chemical industry the</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.309" end="01:32:28.879" style="s2">local bio innovation class that the</p>

<p begin="01:32:41.749" end="01:32:49.309" style="s2">products of olive presses and and what</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.469" end="01:32:51.229" style="s2">while the project hasn&#39;t continued the</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.309" end="01:32:54.409" style="s2">way of questioning we brought to the</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.229" end="01:32:56.389" style="s2">island has landed we are these clusters</p>

<p begin="01:37:39.810" end="01:37:44.940" style="s2">and the narratives and said that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.480" end="01:37:48.810" style="s2">all really excited to actually you know</p>
<p begin="01:37:44.940" end="01:37:50.730" style="s2">turn off the petrol turn on turn up the</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.810" end="01:37:52.770" style="s2">regenerative and do that in an</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.730" end="01:37:55.050" style="s2">agreed-upon hopefully ten year or five</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.770" end="01:37:59.280" style="s2">year I think ten year more realistic</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.050" end="01:38:03.030" style="s2">time frame yeah we have let me come back</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.280" end="01:38:07.730" style="s2">to that basically often people say how</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.030" end="01:38:11.040" style="s2">can you be so audaciously positive and</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.730" end="01:38:12.840" style="s2">about this this vision of diverse</p>

<p begin="01:38:12.840" end="01:38:20.070" style="s2">the world and really it&#39;s when you align</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.350" end="01:38:23.370" style="s2">with life then you have the biggest ally</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.070" end="01:38:26.910" style="s2">possible which is life itself and in an</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.370" end="01:38:30.240" style="s2">in a circle and and yet there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.910" end="01:38:35.310" style="s2">still to be learned from those who have</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.240" end="01:38:39.420" style="s2">been stewarding the last pockets of of</p>

<p begin="01:38:39.420" end="01:38:44.520" style="s2">conditions conducive to life that is</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.010" end="01:38:46.530" style="s2">it&#39;s this beautiful synthesis not a</p>

<p begin="01:38:46.530" end="01:38:52.050" style="s2">idealized indigenous past but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.830" end="01:38:55.400" style="s2">I like the word real digitization which</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.050" end="01:39:00.780" style="s2">which we can&#39;t which which we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.400" end="01:39:03.360" style="s2">waited coil infested white people need</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.780" end="01:39:06.300" style="s2">the guidance of indigenous knowledge to</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.360" end="01:39:09.540" style="s2">do this well but we we can re indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.300" end="01:39:12.720" style="s2">all of us and and also so many of the</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.540" end="01:39:16.140" style="s2">the indigenous indigenous nations have</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.720" end="01:39:19.820" style="s2">also been transformed and co-opted and</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.140" end="01:39:23.190" style="s2">and affected by the the insidious</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.820" end="01:39:25.590" style="s2">development agenda and and industrial</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.190" end="01:39:30.090" style="s2">growth society so they&#39;re not as pure</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.590" end="01:39:33.150" style="s2">and imperfect as sometimes gets gets</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.090" end="01:39:35.670" style="s2">printed trains so it&#39;s exactly Koller</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.150" end="01:39:39.890" style="s2">knee and but but the ally is really life</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.670" end="01:39:42.720" style="s2">itself like all of us as expression</p>
<p begin="01:39:39.890" end="01:39:46.130" style="s2">exactly a world of many worlds a world</p>
