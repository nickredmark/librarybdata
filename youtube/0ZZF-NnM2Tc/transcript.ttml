<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:07.589" style="s2">I want to talk about rival ristmas</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.929" end="00:00:10.500" style="s2">and anti rival resinous during this time</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.589" end="00:00:13.170" style="s2">period it is imperative that we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.500" end="00:00:15.299" style="s2">anti rivalries and nonrival resolutions</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.170" end="00:00:19.279" style="s2">because they&#39;re what is going to get us</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.299" end="00:00:23.449" style="s2">through but our entire society and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.279" end="00:00:26.730" style="s2">personal selves are conditioned to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.449" end="00:00:28.830" style="s2">create rival resolutions ones where I</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.730" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">win and you lose or you win and I lose</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.830" end="00:00:33.410" style="s2">and those aren&#39;t going to get us through</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">and so I&#39;m going to go through a few</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.410" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">categories and what a rival resolution</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">would look like versus been downright</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:40.469" style="s2">low resolution in this time or an anti</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:42.420" style="s2">Bible resolution auntie brotherly</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.469" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">rivalry solution I wish there was a</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.420" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">better name is a solution that the more</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:51.809" style="s2">people are involved in it the better it</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">is as opposed to win lose it&#39;s when more</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.809" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">people come the more we all win and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">grows exponentially which here all are</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:00.390" style="s2">gonna be learned in some exponential</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">math over the lap next few weeks and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.390" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">months that is horrific</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">and this will be some exponential good</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">news as more people join and we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">more capacity to do more and more good</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">in this world so food food under the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">rival risk category looks very much like</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">14 it&#39;s what we&#39;re currently doing look</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:23.070" style="s2">you know for your own making sure you</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">have enough food to come through not</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.070" end="00:01:29.400" style="s2">just the two weeks or months quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">but also the possible impending food</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.400" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s coming down the line of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">course there&#39;s a lot of issues with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough for everyone then</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have a lot of money you</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:39.540" style="s2">go to the stores and there&#39;s enough food</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">but more than that when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.540" end="00:01:42.990" style="s2">down the line even if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">stockpile of food if other people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.990" end="00:01:47.460" style="s2">hungry and other people are starving</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:49.439" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be violence and so what</p>
