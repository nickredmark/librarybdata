<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:38.080" style="s2">it is all about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">zoom out from our everyday perception</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.080" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">of the world to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:48.319" style="s2">some deeper patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">in what is going on and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.319" end="00:02:51.840" style="s2">uh i know that you have had uh jordan</p>

<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">levels of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">this transition that um</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">some of us believe that that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:11.920" style="s2">um and i think just during the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.920" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">there has been uh a rising consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">about the fact that we are actually in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">some sort of deep</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">transition uh brexit</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">uh trump and not the least the covid</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:29.440" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">during the last uh half year has has</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">many of us realize that just going on</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">with incremental change within the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:41.680" style="s2">present system</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">might not be enough to well if i should</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:47.740" style="s2">put it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">drastically to to save our civilization</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.740" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">so jordan is talking about different</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:54.799" style="s2">levels and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:56.080" style="s2">i&#39;ve written about five different levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.799" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">and perhaps i could touch</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.080" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">very briefly on the four</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">first levels there the the first one is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">societal change that is more or less</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">going on every day</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:09.439" style="s2">it&#39;s like the societal change we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">in values</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.439" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">during the last 50 years in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:16.079" style="s2">west</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:19.199" style="s2">that has been in many respects very</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.079" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">drastical and and substantial when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.199" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">comes to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">the place of women in society how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.560" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">minorities how both racial minorities</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">cultural minorities sexual minorities</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">and things like that so in in many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">those respects even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">very much of course still remains to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">done in those areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">we are actually living in a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">of a different world today than</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">than we did 30 40 or 50</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">50 years ago um but um</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">if we look at even a deeper layer we</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:58.960" style="s2">could say that the level two shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">that would be what we uh went through</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.960" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">during the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">industrial uh revolution when really all</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">um of society&#39;s production and the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">that we were functioning society</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">really shifted in in a fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">and and some thinkers are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.919" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">the fact that we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:24.240" style="s2">fourth industrial revolution revolution</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">so those thinkers would believe that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.240" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">are at least at the level two</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">shift today but then</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.720" style="s2">if you look even deeper and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:36.160" style="s2">the shift that we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.720" end="00:05:38.479" style="s2">in right now is is even deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.160" end="00:05:40.560" style="s2">and could be a level three shift which</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.479" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">would be of the magnitude of</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:48.400" style="s2">the enlightenment when we really shifted</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">our world view the fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.400" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">of of looking and perceiving the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">and we went</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">from a dogmatic religious</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:00.479" style="s2">worldview into a rationalistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">scientific worldview</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.479" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">and that worldview has of course been</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">very helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">humanity that is what has given us</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">everything from</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">modern medicine to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:21.039" style="s2">human rights and and democracy</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.600" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">but somehow i think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.039" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">that world view has served its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">but has more or less now reached its</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">limits</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:35.120" style="s2">and that we need to not discard</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">science and and reason but look at ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.120" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">of complementing those</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.160" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">those very powerful ways of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">with other ways of looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">and we might come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:49.440" style="s2">a little bit later and then something is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:51.680" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.440" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">are talking about an even deeper shift</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.680" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">uh going back to</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">uh uh the shift that uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">happened during the axial age and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:03.520" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:04.080" style="s2">john verweger so well has described in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.520" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.080" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">series the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">and that was the shift in humanity</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.800" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">2500 years ago or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:17.240" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:18.800" style="s2">in many places of the world more or less</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.240" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.800" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">we had a shift in culture and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:25.360" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:27.360" style="s2">developing a written language that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.360" end="00:07:29.840" style="s2">enabled us to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.360" end="00:07:31.199" style="s2">the major religions or philosophies or</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.840" end="00:07:32.880" style="s2">the ideologies</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.199" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">that made it possible for humanity</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.880" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">really for the first time to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">go from living in small societies by</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:43.039" style="s2">or small tribes guided mostly by</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">instinct</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.039" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">to really put together a system</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:51.919" style="s2">that would help us to see the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:54.319" style="s2">differently but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.919" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">experience and feel the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.319" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">to make it possible for us to live in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">large societies in cities with many</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">thousands tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">inhabitants</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">and even small civilized civilizations</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">so so that would be a four level shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">and these shifts</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.240" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">have all been in or the deeper shifts</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">have all been in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">what some thinkers call the collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:30.080" style="s2">and the great invention during the axial</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.080" end="00:08:37.360" style="s2">was really to more systematically</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">form a collective imaginary that</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.360" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">made it possible for us humans to live</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">in a completely different world</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">and of course during the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">also our collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">shifted and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">this concept of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">imaginaries is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.760" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">nebulous concept and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">how could we best describe it and where</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.279" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">does it come from</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">well it comes from deep sociology</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">the deeper the shift we believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">that we are in the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">we have to look as just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">back in history to understand what is</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:27.519" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:28.959" style="s2">so we so we need to understand deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.519" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.959" end="00:09:32.720" style="s2">but we also need to look deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.720" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">and to understand deep psychology</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">which um is a little bit the different</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.000" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">psychological approach from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">everyday psychological theory or</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">kbt theory or things like that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">really goes down into both our deep</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:54.959" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">unconscious but also into our collective</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:00.959" style="s2">and i know from listening to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">podcast that you are familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.959" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">union theory and jung is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:07.279" style="s2">one of the psychologists that has really</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.279" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">explored these deeper layers of</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">our our consciousness and are talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:18.399" style="s2">about concepts like the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">and archetypes and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.399" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">so understanding what&#39;s going on we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">to look into the deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:27.040" style="s2">levels of our own consciousness and deep</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.040" end="00:10:30.959" style="s2">because these shifts do not only involve</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">society of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.959" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">it involves also shifting us as in</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">but deep psychology and deep history is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.800" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">not enough</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">we need also to look at deep sociology</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">that has not been up for so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">discussions in in public media</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">not as much as deep history popularized</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.600" style="s2">by</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:11:02.240" style="s2">sapiens hieraris great works and</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">deep sociology uh if i should name</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">starting perhaps with them with the most</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">these these ways of thinking that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.800" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:20.639" style="s2">um two sociologists uh writing in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">60s</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.639" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">uh called berger and lukman</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">and they published a book in 67 i</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:35.920" style="s2">called the social construction of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">reality where they&#39;d really describe</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">this deep sociological process</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:46.480" style="s2">where we as humans construct the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">deeper unconscious levels of society</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.480" end="00:12:52.399" style="s2">and this was now very abstract and</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">and also okay so can i can i give some</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.399" end="00:12:56.639" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:58.560" style="s2">understandable example of what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.639" end="00:13:01.040" style="s2">oh please i think we&#39;ll take the next</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.560" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">hour and a half to begin to put some um</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.040" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">some more flesh on it but i&#39;m i&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">you and i i think it&#39;s brilliant so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">please</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:10.000" style="s2">yeah so so the main thinking the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:11.760" style="s2">the shift in society</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.000" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">the deeper we have to look back in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.760" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">history to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">the deeper we have to look into our own</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:18.399" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">to understand what&#39;s going on than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.399" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">shift needed in us and the deeper we</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">have to look into</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:27.360" style="s2">the shift in in society and when we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">really deep on on the mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.360" end="00:13:30.720" style="s2">level in society we are down to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">collective imaginaries</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.720" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">so an example um</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:43.199" style="s2">we as humans in the modern world</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">we need both air to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.199" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">and money to be able to survive in</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">this world and for us as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">money and oxygen can almost seem equally</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">important and tangible and necessary</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">for us to to function in and survive</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">in the modern world but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">but there is a deep difference between</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:10.720" style="s2">oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">and money and the difference is so deep</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.720" end="00:14:15.360" style="s2">that you could talk about an</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.360" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">a philosophical sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">made up of completely different um</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">completely different kinds they are</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">and have to be understood in different</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.839" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:36.480" style="s2">so if we take oxygen even if</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.839" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">all of humanity came together and said</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.480" end="00:14:39.920" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to be dependent on oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">any longer</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.920" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">we want humanity to be free of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">dependence on oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">we couldn&#39;t do anything about that but</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">if we came together</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.360" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">all of humanity or even perhaps just in</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">a nation state</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">and said that we would like to change</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">that we allocate goods in society we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">don&#39;t want to use</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:04.240" style="s2">money any longer we want to use</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:09.760" style="s2">then money would be gone tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">so there is something very different</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.760" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">between these two</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">concepts and one way to say is that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:18.480" style="s2">oxygen is a natural phenomenon our</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">understanding of oxygen might not be</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.480" end="00:15:23.360" style="s2">natural but</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">oxygen itself is is natural</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.360" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">whereas money is a social construct</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an imaginary it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:35.120" style="s2">that we humans have</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">thought up invented in our mind as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.120" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">but it is not just in my individual</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.839" style="s2">it is in our collective imaginary we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.839" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">in money and the fact that we all</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:50.959" style="s2">including society believe in money</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">makes it necessary for me as an</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.959" end="00:15:56.160" style="s2">individual to actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:57.920" style="s2">see money as something very tangible</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.160" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">when i&#39;m checking out in my local</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.920" end="00:16:01.759" style="s2">supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">i cannot just tell the cashier that</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.759" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">money is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.959" style="s2">human invention and i don&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">money</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.959" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">no yeah money is sanctioned by society</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:12.800" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.399" style="s2">is therefore meeting me as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.800" end="00:16:17.680" style="s2">as something</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.399" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">something very real and tangible and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.680" end="00:16:20.560" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:21.519" style="s2">the little sad thing here is that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.560" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.519" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">mix this all up so</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">if we look at oxygen and the natural</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">we sometimes believe that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:40.480" style="s2">the planetary boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">is something that is up for negotiation</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.480" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">whereas the market forces is something</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">we just as humanity have to obey</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">when it is of course the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:56.399" style="s2">so coming to this realization that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:16:58.560" style="s2">of things in our world</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.399" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">i would say the majority of things in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.560" end="00:17:02.639" style="s2">our human world</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:04.799" style="s2">is actually just human inventions that</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.639" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">we can see from history</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.799" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">were invented sometimes consciously but</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">many times just by</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:15.839" style="s2">pure accidents and and flukes of</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:18.000" style="s2">of history and of course this is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.839" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">just money and the market is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.000" end="00:17:24.400" style="s2">nation states it&#39;s marriage it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">precedence it&#39;s or all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.400" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">that exists because we believe in them</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">collectively and should we stop</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">believing in those things collectively</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.919" style="s2">then the nation states and</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">the presidents would be gone would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.919" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">gone</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:41.200" style="s2">tomorrow and so with many of our social</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:46.160" style="s2">institutions rituals</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.200" end="00:17:49.360" style="s2">and um other things</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.160" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">and of course realizing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">then that is something that is very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">empowering us</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">perhaps not empowering us as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">but definitely empowering us as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:07.840" style="s2">and in these deep shifts in society</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:10.160" style="s2">we have these deep shifts in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.840" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.160" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">but in order for us to exercise this</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">collective freedom</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">that this insight gives us then we need</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">to be able to do collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">in order to</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">to enable collective action and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">collective agency</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">and as many have pointed out on your on</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">your um</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">podcast not the least john verweger we</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">are today</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:42.640" style="s2">so bad at collective sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">the collective sense-making is</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.640" end="00:18:48.559" style="s2">is breaking down so then</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">we all become sort of slaves under this</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.559" end="00:18:53.039" style="s2">collective imaginary and because</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">we we are we can&#39;t make sense and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.039" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about this and we can&#39;t act</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.039" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">then we are losing a lot of human</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">freedom in that way our collective</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.160" style="s2">freedom</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">to shape our collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.160" end="00:19:09.760" style="s2">okay so that was uh that was a high</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">level uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.760" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">introduction i i hope we didn&#39;t lose all</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:17.919" style="s2">all our listeners</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">there well well um you know i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.919" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">i think it&#39;s brilliant i&#39;m very grateful</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:22.799" style="s2">for such a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">context in a framing you&#39;ve laid down</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.799" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:28.000" style="s2">i mean there are so many ways i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">feeling i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.000" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">bite into this because</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">the the sense i get the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">um the agency that thinking in this way</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">can afford i think is a very um powerful</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">and beautiful thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.840" style="s2">this this notion this this recognition</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">that we&#39;re so deeply involved in</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">creating our world is something that can</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">that can um that can work for us and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.160" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">if we can only so manage to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.160" end="00:20:04.480" style="s2">perceive i think um more clearly</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">to to perceive and interact with more</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.480" end="00:20:09.039" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:11.919" style="s2">and yet here&#39;s to add in something</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.039" end="00:20:12.400" style="s2">not a spanner in the works exactly but</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.919" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.400" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">one way in which things get so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">complicated is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">when we begin to recognize that um okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:23.360" style="s2">some of these aspects of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:26.159" style="s2">imaginary take</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.360" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">money for example while there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.159" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">lineage of our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">behavioral processes that have created</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">this phenomenon something like a habit</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">that we&#39;re all participating in</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.520" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">if we were in fact all to come together</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;d be very hard in fact to decide</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">not to use it anymore and what would</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">be underneath that and how could we</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">reorient</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">and there the collective imaginary of</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:52.400" style="s2">course comes right back in because</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:27.840" style="s2">a very important point that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">that the the collective imaginary is to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.840" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">like water is to the fish</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.960" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">so we so we need really to do that as an</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.960" end="00:22:01.760" style="s2">we are not trained to to see it because</p>

<p begin="00:22:22.480" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">of life but it&#39;s really when we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:30.159" style="s2">and the collective decision processes</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.159" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">it is on that level that more and more</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:35.919" style="s2">people start to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">on the highest level of our political</p>

<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">then things are breaking down and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">course the</p>

<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:57.039" style="s2">wanted to do something</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">why isn&#39;t anything happening anyhow so</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.039" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">how do we translate this</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">individual will of many people into some</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">sort of collective action and</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:08.559" style="s2">and that we are as good as we have</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.559" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">and realize during the last 100 years or</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:17.600" style="s2">200 years since the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">our own individual freedom equally bad</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">freedom and and i would perhaps even</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:28.080" style="s2">argue that we are</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">years ago definitely 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.720" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">ago why is that the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">well i touch a bit upon that in in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">first book that you mentioned the market</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">myth</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:52.240" style="s2">and and i think that is a a little bit</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.240" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m as you know i&#39;m in former</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">investment uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:24:04.320" style="s2">banker myself i i i built my</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">successfully within the market</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:19.600" style="s2">and and i should also say that it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.600" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">realizing that the market and being an</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:30.080" style="s2">in inside the market that it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:33.120" style="s2">more useful for me to look at the market</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.080" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">as a sociological phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.120" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">than to apply the standard economic</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">thinking the neoclassical economic</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">paradigm paradigm but this neoclassical</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:55.679" style="s2">that is putting so much belief</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.039" style="s2">in the market that the market has really</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.679" end="00:24:59.520" style="s2">become a myth</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.039" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">it has been the the sort of the the</p>

<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">today and in that way just like the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.799" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">foundational myths of other societies</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s become a little bit of a sacred</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">sacred thing and of course the market is</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:21.120" style="s2">super a super powerful tool</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">and can help us uh in in and has helped</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.120" end="00:25:25.919" style="s2">humanity to reach this</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.520" style="s2">level where where we are today and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.919" end="00:25:29.679" style="s2">super effective when it comes to</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">um but we have put during the last 50</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">especially the last 30 years a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">bit too</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">much belief in the ability for the</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">decision making in those areas where</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">the market cannot function and of course</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">the market cannot provide and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">collective goods like military defense</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">for example that is a standard example</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:32.480" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">collective good that the market can</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.480" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">cannot provide but has to be a political</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">decision because you cannot decide</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:42.960" style="s2">to want to to buy military protection</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.960" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">two thousand dollars and and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">i want military protection for seven</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">thousand dollars no</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">if we have military protection everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">is benefiting from it</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">so we all need to collectively chip into</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">to to finance it</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s the standard example but you</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.600" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">could say other things like</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">for example uh even our societal</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.279" end="00:27:48.480" style="s2">cannot function and and the typical or</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:51.279" style="s2">example of that is personal development</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.480" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">so some somebody could could tell you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.279" end="00:27:54.799" style="s2">that yeah you should really spend the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">time and the money necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.799" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">to take the next step in your personal</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">development and you might say</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">well what is this and that can possibly</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">not be worth this</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">time and money you are talking about so</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">um i don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:11.120" style="s2">and and no advertisement campaign could</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:13.679" style="s2">sort of convey</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.120" end="00:28:14.559" style="s2">the the true benefits they could entice</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.679" end="00:28:16.720" style="s2">you to do it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.559" end="00:28:18.000" style="s2">but they couldn&#39;t convey the true</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.720" end="00:28:19.840" style="s2">benefits of it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:22.000" style="s2">until you&#39;ve gone through it and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.840" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">you could say wow</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.000" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">i mean that this was worth it many times</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:27.120" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:29.279" style="s2">yeah but you can&#39;t really explain it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.120" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">your friend yeah exactly no</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.279" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">exactly i mean so in those cases uh um</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">the market is not working so come back</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">to your question so why are we bad at</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">collective uh sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">collective agency</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:46.159" style="s2">one reason is that we have delegated too</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">much to to the market because we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.159" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">we have so we are so bad at collectively</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">making sense</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">of things so then it&#39;s better to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">well let&#39;s just rely on on</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.799" style="s2">on the market instead of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:01.760" style="s2">figure um</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.799" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">things out so so that is one reason but</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.760" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">then the other reason is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:07.840" style="s2">in this post-modern philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">society that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.840" end="00:29:13.360" style="s2">live in right now uh that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:18.080" style="s2">real philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.360" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">foundation to rank values</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.080" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">to this to decide collectively on for</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:26.240" style="s2">example to take a crude example</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">what should we produce in society should</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.240" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">we produce</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.919" style="s2">theater or pornography we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.919" end="00:29:35.279" style="s2">because i mean who am i to say what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">should consume and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.279" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">what&#39;s right and wrong and we have this</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:40.880" style="s2">value relativity</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">so then it&#39;s much more easy to just say</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.880" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">well let the market sort that out</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:47.039" style="s2">we let the market decide and then we</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be disgusting whether we</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.039" end="00:29:50.720" style="s2">can have</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:52.159" style="s2">value hierarchies or or not and if those</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.720" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">hierarchies could be</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.159" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">universal or if they are always just the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">power structures that</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">some people are trying to impose on on</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.919" style="s2">on others</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">so um even though i appreciate very much</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.799" style="s2">post modern philosophy and insights and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">of course a deep insight of postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.799" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">philosophy is the existence</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">of these collective imaginaries and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">how they have power over us and how they</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:21.440" style="s2">have our power structures in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.440" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s very important uh postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">insights but then if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">postmodern philosophy a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.200" style="s2">few steps too far then you end up in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.200" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">relativism and that has had the effect</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:40.399" style="s2">that even though most postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">philosophers are</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.399" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">very critical towards the market</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.880" style="s2">this philosophy has still enabled the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.880" end="00:30:57.039" style="s2">to take a very dominant position</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">in our world and i would even argue</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.039" end="00:31:03.519" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">as some philosophers say that each</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.519" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">collective imaginary that we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">always needs a fundamental authority</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:14.240" style="s2">to anchor this relatively random</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.240" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">in and during a huge</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:24.399" style="s2">span of human history</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">usually our collective imaginaries were</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.399" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">were anchored in</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">god religion god god had the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:33.679" style="s2">the right answer was in the holy book so</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:39.279" style="s2">put an anchor to to this fairly random</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">collective imaginary then through the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.279" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:45.600" style="s2">in in the collective imaginary of of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">reason and science</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.600" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">their science became the anchoring</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">element so</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">we could find the truth through science</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">and if we hadn&#39;t found the truth yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">science and a combination of science and</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">would help us find the truth of course</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">this is something that the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:14.320" style="s2">worldview is</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">deconstructing correctly so saying</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.320" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">that that every</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:22.000" style="s2">uh collective imaginary and every</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">fundamental authority</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.000" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">is just a human construct so god</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:29.600" style="s2">and science are just human constructs</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">and therefore not</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.600" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">absolute anchoring points and claiming</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">that in today&#39;s world there is no</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">absolute anchor point</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">that is correct but then we still need</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">an anchoring point that is why we</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">invented god</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">in the first place so then today i claim</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">the market is</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:58.159" style="s2">fulfilling that function</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">even though that was not the intention</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">of the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:03.279" style="s2">philosophers that is still the actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.000" style="s2">effect</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.279" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">so we have a relative very relativistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.000" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">post-modern world</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">view but still our social imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:15.360" style="s2">today our social world</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">is very much anchored in in the market</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.360" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">and i think that what needs to happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">now in this shift that we are going</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">we we need to change that and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">in order to do that we we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:30.880" style="s2">become aware of the importance of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.880" end="00:33:34.399" style="s2">and not just be subject to a randomly</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.399" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">collective imaginary or a collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">imaginary that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">has been constructed intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">by some sort of um special interest</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.559" style="s2">it has to be a collective imaginary that</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:52.000" style="s2">that serves humanity as a whole and also</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.559" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">the planet</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.000" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">and all of that and that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:59.519" style="s2">anchored in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">new meta-narrative but the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.519" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">philosophers are right in claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:08.000" style="s2">every meta-narrative is man-made</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">that is true so therefore</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.000" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">we need to co-create and co-construct</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.960" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">the new meta</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">narrative and holding that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">knowing that it&#39;s not given by god or</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">given by nature</p>

<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">or narratives because i&#39;m come back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:28.320" style="s2">that or</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">also later i don&#39;t think that we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.320" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">moving into or we shouldn&#39;t be moving</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:34.240" style="s2">into just</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">but in order for those narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:49.040" style="s2">those cultures</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">to actually be able to live together and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.040" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">and enrich each other&#39;s by giving us</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:56.560" style="s2">many perspectives of the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">we still need some sort of holding</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.560" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">containers</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.839" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">the story about this good multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">society that we can agree upon otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">we would never be able to exercise</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">our collective imaginary freedom</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">and we would never be able to to solve</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">these crises we have in today&#39;s meta</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:19.760" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">like the environmental problems yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.760" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">hear you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">yeah beautiful thank you for that okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:29.040" style="s2">let me see let me see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:31.119" style="s2">say some um things that may in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.040" end="00:35:32.880" style="s2">helpful maybe we can build a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.119" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">from them together</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.880" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">cool okay help us all understand this</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:40.240" style="s2">now and why</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:40.560" style="s2">oh no that&#39;s not my job here i&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.240" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.560" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">it&#39;s i&#39;m taking us into a nosedive all</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:48.880" style="s2">right okay okay here it is</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:51.920" style="s2">so part of the issue we face is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">at least psychologically speaking if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.920" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">undergo a kind of transformative process</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.480" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">that can be chaotic almost by definition</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.480" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">very uncertain and we&#39;re not sure what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">going to emerge on the other side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">one of the reasons why we might not like</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">so this idea this uh this this</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">post-modern critique</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:14.480" style="s2">this recognition that much of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">knowledge building um is in fact built</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.480" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:18.320" style="s2">a kind of a set of perspectives that can</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">be critiqued</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.320" end="00:36:21.760" style="s2">and cannot in fact serve as these</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.760" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">grounding points around which everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:26.800" style="s2">can orient</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s like okay it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.800" end="00:36:31.119" style="s2">challenge that pick away at that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay there we go now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.119" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">getting into some of the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">part of the meaning crisis this famous</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">position of the death of god that nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.400" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">that nature speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:41.839" style="s2">a kind of breakdown in coherence we</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">might say</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.839" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">an anchoring pillar of coherence but</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">what we want to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">is that um okay uh we&#39;re deeply involved</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">in the creation of the fabric</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:59.599" style="s2">which in fact um is the coherence making</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.599" end="00:37:03.040" style="s2">between us and then the question is how</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">can we</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:08.560" style="s2">not just coherence making but but also</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">structuring and making our society</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.560" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">function</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">efficiently and i think we should we</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">should also say that</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">this why do we need this anchoring point</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:23.440" style="s2">well it is a huge gift to humanity by</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.440" end="00:37:29.599" style="s2">our ability to construct</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">the symbolic world and the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.599" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">language and this was given to us by</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">by evolution already back in in stone</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:40.079" style="s2">age when we started to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">to use language to tell stories and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.079" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">gathered around the fire and we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">talking stories and trying to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">and the fact that we could construct</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">these different symbolic worlds</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:56.079" style="s2">had huge survival</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:58.320" style="s2">value for humans because that made it</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.079" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">possible to us to occupy</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">many different niches in in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:05.119" style="s2">nature and be able to to live anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:08.960" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.119" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">alaska up to um</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.960" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">to greenland so this has had</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">a huge survival value that we have this</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">freedom to construct our symbolic world</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">our collective imaginary but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:26.400" style="s2">is exactly the one you put in</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">your finger on for for this to work in</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.400" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">in a human society</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">we need to live in the same or basically</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:35.520" style="s2">collective imaginary because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:37.520" style="s2">we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.520" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">communicate and we can&#39;t make sense and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.520" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">we can&#39;t cohere</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">so that so that is that is why we then</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">invented religion and other tools</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">to really make it possible for us</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.440" style="s2">to do collective sense making and to</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">cohere around these</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.440" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">things but when we forget about these</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">things when we throw out really</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:03.760" style="s2">religion and when we correctly create um</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">when we correctly point out that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.760" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">scientific perspective of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">world is just one perspective among many</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">a very important perspective and not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">random perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">but it it is one perspective among many</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">then we are starting to lose coherence</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:25.680" style="s2">and we we we have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:28.880" style="s2">rediscovered the importance of</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.680" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">uh the collective imaginary because we</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.880" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">can&#39;t really see the evolutionary value</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:34.240" style="s2">of religions</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">and on those narratives and of course we</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.240" end="00:39:38.320" style="s2">are very careful not wanting to replace</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">a religious narrative with an</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.320" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">ideological</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">narrative like communism or fascism or</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:48.240" style="s2">or something we want to we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:51.440" style="s2">the freedom</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.240" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">and the multiple perspectives of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.440" end="00:39:57.920" style="s2">liberal democratic multicultural world</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">but we still need to cohere in some</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.920" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:02.560" style="s2">and that is the dilemma that we are in</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">yeah i feel this this tension point is</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">uh well of course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">critical and deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:21.040" style="s2">it&#39;s something that&#39;s a big part of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:25.280" style="s2">work it&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:28.480" style="s2">certainly a point of real</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.280" end="00:40:30.640" style="s2">real interest and i&#39;m committed to this</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">tension in an important sense with this</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.640" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">project and with</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.800" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">with all the relationships i&#39;m forming i</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.680" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">because it turns out this seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.680" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">that the dynamics of relationship itself</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:47.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:50.640" style="s2">how we show up yeah within self</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.280" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">but then also with each other there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.640" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">have this capacity</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">to transform our shared capacity for</p>

<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">something like transformation through a</p>

<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">um that we i think it&#39;s from that kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.960" style="s2">of source</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:26.880" style="s2">that we can begin to feel fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.960" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">what a mode or a way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.880" end="00:41:31.520" style="s2">coherence with each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">is even if we don&#39;t in fact know the</p>

<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">isn&#39;t what we&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">no but we can find a way in</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like just to go better on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">those of those of um you are still</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">listening the first 25 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">for me this conversation has been a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">has been listening</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">right and it&#39;s been a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">listening and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">what you&#39;ve presenced has enabled us</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">with so many concepts and a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">context to play with right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:08.480" style="s2">and see through um and now</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:09.839" style="s2">it comes to this point where okay how do</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.480" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">i find</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.839" end="00:42:14.480" style="s2">myself in this and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">finding myself as an isolated entity but</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">how can i add to this so that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">all of a sudden can begin to share in</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">something together</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">knowing that we&#39;re not going to solve</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">everything but we can&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">and as you pointed out this process is</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">emergent so we can&#39;t plan this</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">and and we can&#39;t figure out the the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">end result but we can still facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">and be active participants in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">process but then we come back to what</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">where you were going before and i</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">deviated a little bit when you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.119" style="s2">introduce the the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:53.200" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.119" end="00:42:57.200" style="s2">in this because when we move into these</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.200" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">shifts the deeper these shifts</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.200" end="00:43:03.440" style="s2">are the more turbulent our whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">world is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.440" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">and and to not completely freak out as</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">an individual in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">shift and perhaps even as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:14.920" style="s2">be able to actively contribute and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:18.000" style="s2">become a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.920" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">co-creator in this shift that</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.000" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">demands a lot of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">capabilities uh on our</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:28.079" style="s2">from from our side and i know that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.079" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">you have spoken on your podcasts uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.560" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">about uh adult developmental</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">theory and the importance of of doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">inner work and constantly knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">we are on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">lifelong journey of in the maturation so</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">if we use the language of</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.920" end="00:44:06.720" style="s2">then you are very much dependent on</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:35.200" style="s2">and you perhaps start perceiving and</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.200" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">of a self-authoring mind then you can</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">distance yourself from your culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.040" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">and and and to look at your culture from</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">the outside and your values from the</p>

<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">and that is a prerequisite for you to at</p>

<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">participant in this process without</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">and it is this freaking out that we see</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">in many places in the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">today where people are look are so</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:21.839" style="s2">this shift and looking for security</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.240" end="00:45:23.599" style="s2">and in many cases they are looking for</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.839" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">security in the form of an</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.599" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">authoritarian leader or from a dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">religion or just something to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">in this</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">chaos that they are uh so afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:40.560" style="s2">of steps stepping into but but the more</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">grounded you are in yourself and the</p>

<p begin="00:45:52.079" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">and to become an active</p>

<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:02.079" style="s2">wants to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s beautifully said yeah i would i</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.079" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">i really want to get into that but it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">being in a plane when it&#39;s turbulent and</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">pleasant thing i&#39;ve done quite a bit of</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.680" style="s2">maybe this is it you know i&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.599" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">heard a plane so</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.680" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">so loud and then it got quite quiet</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.200" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ve i&#39;ve rarely told this story</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s funny because i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">the face of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">of the man who was sitting next to me</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">but i remember we were holding hands</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">and um all of a sudden um</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:51.200" style="s2">people started to talk to each other it</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">went from</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.200" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">shrieks to all of a sudden a whole plane</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.760" style="s2">in conversation</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.440" style="s2">and i was holding hands with this with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.760" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">this man i was trying to comfort him in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.440" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">and it stayed terrible um the turbulence</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">right up until we landed but we landed</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s just something about</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">and it you know it&#39;s ephemeral thing i</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not in touch with anyone and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s a while ago now but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">something about</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">a group of people finding each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">to converse with you know a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">comforting of each other and i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:32.160" style="s2">giving up right and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">um you know this metaphor isn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.160" end="00:48:34.960" style="s2">take us exactly where we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s a sense in which we were</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.960" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">just looking for security and we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">really creating our way out of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s something beautiful we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">do when it</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">comes to facing turbulence when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">facing chaos and that&#39;s we can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:54.480" style="s2">hold hands and be together</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s there&#39;s really no other way to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.480" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s um no other certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">capacity to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">yeah exactly if</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">or project that fear in various</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:22.960" style="s2">uh directions and that that is also of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">course a human instinct that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.960" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">yeah if we feel this fear try to find a</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:29.920" style="s2">scapegoat</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">to try to find them that we could uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.920" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">scapegoat and project our fears towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">but it&#39;s exciting now you know there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">genuine hope because</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.960" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">what what i feel a lot is i and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">seeking to engage in transformative</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">conversations for</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">a long time and i&#39;m feeling that there</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:54.559" style="s2">um a really a burgeoning</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">interest and there&#39;s a lot of available</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.559" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">energy wonderful projects you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">including the stowa rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">starting communities but</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:03.440" style="s2">many discord communities there&#39;s a voice</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:05.359" style="s2">craft collective</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.440" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">which is a group of us who get together</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">to have conversations and experimenting</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">with ways we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:15.839" style="s2">effectively be generative together</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">um and it this ties into i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.839" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">some of the inner developmental um</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:23.200" style="s2">stuff a direction we might take but it</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">seems like um</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.200" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">worthwhile to just nod to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">i really</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:33.359" style="s2">in the face of so much turbulence</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">um and we can it&#39;s a bit like a roller</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.359" end="00:50:36.880" style="s2">coaster you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:38.559" style="s2">i mean i certainly feel hope sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.880" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">begin to fade but i also</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">feel a resounding a resounding</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:47.119" style="s2">note of it um and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">along with all of these podcasts you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.119" end="00:50:50.160" style="s2">know there&#39;s genuine invitations to</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">people and i think that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.160" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">important that we both</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">that we both appreciate is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">importance of extending invitations to</p>

<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">jokingly um sometimes called</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:56.720" style="s2">what they did was that they created a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:58.079" style="s2">lot of retreat centers</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.720" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">and that is actually what they did i</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.079" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">mean they were not called retreat</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">centers back then but they were</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:07.599" style="s2">centers often out in nature uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">committed to programs of of of</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.599" end="00:56:11.440" style="s2">learning but also inner development and</p>

<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">and by the turn of the last century year</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">1900 there were actually a hundred cents</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:51.760" style="s2">talk about society talk about technology</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:54.960" style="s2">talk about this shift</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">that they were in and in that way become</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.960" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">conscious co-creators of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">the new society and when this program</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">was at it</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:06.880" style="s2">its height actually 10 of each young</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:10.880" style="s2">generation participated</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.880" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">in programs like this and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.880" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">created a a critical mass or a tipping</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">point in the complex system we would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:23.920" style="s2">today using using that language</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">and what was especially beautiful in</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.920" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">this case i think was that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">participants</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:29.599" style="s2">in these programs they came from all</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.599" end="00:57:34.720" style="s2">layers of society and actually majority</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">of the participants were from farming or</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.720" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">working class background so you had</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">these conscious co-creators not just in</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:42.960" style="s2">a small elite somewhere in society but</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.960" end="00:57:48.480" style="s2">fairly well distributed all over and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:49.440" style="s2">and that managed to create this tipping</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.480" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.440" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">now now of course we are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:56.799" style="s2">lose this in scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">and we discussed that in our book as as</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.799" end="00:58:01.119" style="s2">well because</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">after the second world war we we started</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.119" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">change world view again and we forgot</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">the importance of our inner world and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">the possibility of the lifelong</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.920" style="s2">development that we had</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">learned from the german bildung</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.920" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">philosophers i just</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">mentioned and we instead turned to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">anglo-saxon world we turned to oxford</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">and cambridge and to the us</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">and and there it was still the old world</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">view on</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:32.000" style="s2">loch ger with them our mind as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">rational machine and</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.000" end="00:58:35.440" style="s2">not at all the focus on lifelong in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">development and</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.440" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">the importance of that both for</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">individuals</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">but also for society so that&#39;s the story</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:44.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.079" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.240" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">blueprint for how we should do it today</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.079" end="00:58:49.040" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">certainly it&#39;s a case study showing that</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.040" end="00:58:51.760" style="s2">what we are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.839" style="s2">on on pods like this about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.760" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">importance of inner development</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.839" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">in these shifts that that is not just</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">new interesting idea it has actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:03.599" style="s2">been tried</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">large scale full scale in three</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">countries</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">a little bit different implementation in</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">each country and it actually worked in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:13.680" style="s2">all of those</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">countries today we might make use of</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.680" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">technology to bring down the costs</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:22.400" style="s2">for this and one initiative that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:25.440" style="s2">involved with is the 29k</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:28.240" style="s2">initiative which is a digital platform</p>

<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:43.280" style="s2">i&#39;m really looking forward to seeing how</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:44.720" style="s2">that develops i&#39;ve checked it out and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.280" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll include some links</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.720" end="00:59:51.599" style="s2">um but let me let me see if i can</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">tie a couple things together here</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.599" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">i want to see if i can bring in</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="01:00:02.000" style="s2">this this</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">need we have to do something about the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.000" end="01:00:06.160" style="s2">absence of a meta narrative we can all</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">participate</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.160" end="01:00:11.440" style="s2">in but perhaps to play with</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">maybe play with some different language</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:18.319" style="s2">there um because</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:22.599" style="s2">it&#39;s unclear to me</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.319" end="01:00:26.240" style="s2">whether we can frame things in terms of</p>

<p begin="01:00:26.240" end="01:00:30.000" style="s2">i think unless we want to say something</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.799" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.000" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">the meta narrative is that which</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">continually um</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:43.200" style="s2">it fuels itself through</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">a reciprocal process of extending</p>

<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">for people to participate and develop</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.280" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">the narrative or</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:52.559" style="s2">create their own narratives in some</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">fundamental sense but i think the link</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.559" end="01:00:57.200" style="s2">in fact like the imminent</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">um link or maybe like the where i at</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.200" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:01.280" style="s2">feel i can where my hope let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">grounds</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.280" end="01:01:04.559" style="s2">where my hope is grounded is again back</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.559" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">relationship and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.280" end="01:01:27.359" style="s2">almost there</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.400" end="01:01:28.319" style="s2">hmm it&#39;s it&#39;s part of this issue we have</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.359" end="01:01:32.280" style="s2">is trust</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.319" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">you know is his trust in the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.280" end="01:01:36.720" style="s2">relationality that is the very essence</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:38.480" style="s2">of the commons</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.720" end="01:01:40.160" style="s2">right we&#39;ve spoken about the market and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.480" end="01:01:41.760" style="s2">we can talk about the state and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.160" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">in fact in a conversation i heard john</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.760" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">viveki have with jordan hall and greg</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:48.480" style="s2">henriquez which i really recommend um</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">people check out um i can include a link</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.480" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">to that as well</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">jordan sort of offered a formal</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">articulation of the relationship between</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">the commons the market and the state and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:03.359" style="s2">was sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:05.599" style="s2">speaking about how to reinvigorate</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.359" end="01:02:07.119" style="s2">the commons which has in fact broken</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.599" end="01:02:08.000" style="s2">down we might look at it as a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.119" end="01:02:10.960" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.000" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">um fellowship or kinship fundamentally a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.960" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:17.920" style="s2">communal friendship right mediated by</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">an effective and vital let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.920" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">collective imaginary to use some of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">language we&#39;ve been speaking about so</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:23.599" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of and of course the</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.599" end="01:02:29.520" style="s2">collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s is itself such a comma</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.520" end="01:02:35.359" style="s2">yes itself such such a</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">a common and if we do it and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.359" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">take care of</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.960" end="01:02:43.520" style="s2">of it as a common then then we will uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">perhaps have the tragedy of the common</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.520" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">yeah beautiful okay so so they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">effectively they&#39;re playing the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">role here</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.119" style="s2">we can sort of substitute one one for</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:54.720" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.119" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">so to um so so how then</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.720" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">fundamentally like this is this is one</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:02.400" style="s2">of the problems we have to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">we have to um address on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.400" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">basis</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:10.319" style="s2">how can we open interactions</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.799" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">how can we extend invitations how can we</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.319" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">participate with each other</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">when the turbulence of the difference</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:21.760" style="s2">in shared sense of collective imaginary</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:23.599" style="s2">is present and my proposition would be</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.760" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.599" end="01:03:27.599" style="s2">we mentioned in a development we</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:28.240" style="s2">mentioned self-authoring and what have</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.599" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.240" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">but this metaphor of the holding hands</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:33.359" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something in there there</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.359" end="01:03:36.720" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">felt sense it&#39;s almost like on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.720" end="01:03:43.119" style="s2">breath it&#39;s it&#39;s just a fluency of</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">breathing in and out being able to just</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.119" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">slow down and it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">metaphorically for me it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">connecting with the person&#39;s eyes you</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:51.920" style="s2">know it&#39;s just seeing that little bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.640" style="s2">deeper</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.920" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">and all of a sudden the complexity of</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.640" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">our potential</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">right that&#39;s in some sense um</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">transcendent to whatever the collective</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">imaginary is of the time</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:09.839" style="s2">it&#39;s like a source to to draw from</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s this it&#39;s such a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.839" end="01:04:13.680" style="s2">thing that just with</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">almost with the right intention with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.680" end="01:04:17.760" style="s2">with the right feeling</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:18.559" style="s2">with the right extending of the hand you</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.760" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.559" end="01:04:22.160" style="s2">just it&#39;s a little moment and then all</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">of a sudden we can begin to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.160" end="01:04:26.319" style="s2">just get to know each other a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.960" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">some words that comes to my mind here</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.520" end="01:04:33.680" style="s2">are the words of</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:38.839" style="s2">my my friend the african philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.680" end="01:04:42.480" style="s2">bio akumolafe he sometimes says</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.839" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">um my ancestors tell me</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.480" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">we are in an emergency we have to slow</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.640" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">and that is so counterintuitive to our</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.799" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">western</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">mind but i think that is what what you</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">are talking about here that</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:58.640" style="s2">in this turbulence we we might just want</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:01.520" style="s2">to rush in</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.640" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">and do things and try to make meaning</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.520" end="01:05:06.839" style="s2">and solve things but</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">the way we might need to do at least</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.839" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">is to slow down and and to reach deep</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:15.359" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:20.160" style="s2">uh ourselves and and to see</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.359" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">what ways we can contribute and how we</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.160" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">in the best way can be meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">participants</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">in this process because i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:27.280" style="s2">putting the finger on the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.280" end="01:05:30.799" style="s2">that we have to look at this as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:33.280" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.799" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">it&#39;s not one meta-narrative we want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.280" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">reach it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">one of society we want to need</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">technological change is now so so fast</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:44.799" style="s2">society and everything is developing so</p>

<p begin="01:05:44.799" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">that we cannot say what the world will</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.599" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">be like in</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:52.799" style="s2">20 years perhaps not even 10 years but</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">when we cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.799" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">certain about the good outcome of the</p>

<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:00.640" style="s2">then we can&#39;t not just give up and say</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.839" end="01:06:03.760" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.640" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">then let&#39;s just see what happens no then</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.760" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.240" style="s2">focus needs to shift from the outcome to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">the process</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.240" end="01:06:12.000" style="s2">and instead of asking ourselves what is</p>

<p begin="01:06:12.000" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">to ask ourselves just like you did what</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.640" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">is the good</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">process how can we talk about a good</p>

<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.880" style="s2">and how can we all become and</p>

<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">invitations to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.480" end="01:06:51.839" style="s2">involve yourself in just this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:55.039" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.839" end="01:06:58.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a vision a collaborative vision</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.039" end="01:07:00.640" style="s2">developing um i that i at least see</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.480" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">in this metacultural space that looks</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.640" end="01:07:05.280" style="s2">something like a networked group of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:06.240" style="s2">communities there&#39;s movement between and</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.280" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.240" end="01:07:11.920" style="s2">there&#39;s elders and wisdom keepers and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">people who connect at a level of feeling</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.920" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">and people who connect a level of</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">thinking and</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:17.920" style="s2">and in a recognition of the importance</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">of the integration between these</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.920" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">um i talk sometimes about</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:29.200" style="s2">integrating the thinking and the doing</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">and and and the being or the becoming</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.200" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">part so uh yeah so we can&#39;t just be in</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">our heads but we need</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:39.920" style="s2">theory and we need we need understanding</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">um and then we need</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.920" end="01:07:43.599" style="s2">entrepreneurship we need people who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:46.960" style="s2">actually doing things</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.599" end="01:07:47.839" style="s2">in this field experimenting in this</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.960" end="01:07:50.880" style="s2">field</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.839" end="01:07:52.559" style="s2">building bridges into this fog foggy</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.880" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">future that we don&#39;t know where it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.559" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">but we</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">still need to do things experiment</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:00.960" style="s2">and then what i tend to forget the most</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:03.520" style="s2">being mostly in the thinking and doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.960" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">side but we we need the being and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.520" end="01:08:08.720" style="s2">need the becoming</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.119" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">and and we need to slow down and</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.720" end="01:08:15.440" style="s2">to to reach deep into our being and</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">becoming to see how we can best</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.440" end="01:08:20.719" style="s2">contribute in this process</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:21.120" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s beautiful thomas um yeah</p>

<p begin="01:08:39.600" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">the book but in</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:46.239" style="s2">what what&#39;s what&#39;s on the cusp for you</p>

<p begin="01:08:49.520" end="01:08:56.239" style="s2">future at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.199" end="01:08:59.679" style="s2">i just came back from a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.239" end="01:08:59.679" style="s2">experiment at um</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.000" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">my foundations island outside stockholm</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.799" end="01:09:06.400" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">the oak island ear credit where we had</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.400" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:12.560" style="s2">gathered a few um</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:15.199" style="s2">uh people who from the crowd that we</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.560" end="01:09:17.199" style="s2">gathered at the emerge gathering in kiev</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.199" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">last year and we were experimenting</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.199" end="01:09:22.400" style="s2">there a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">with collective sense making</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.400" end="01:09:29.920" style="s2">so we gather a small group of</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">european facilitators people with</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.920" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">decades of experience of facilitating</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:35.920" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:36.480" style="s2">processes and and to see whether whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.920" end="01:09:40.080" style="s2">we could</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.480" end="01:09:41.839" style="s2">tap deeper into this being or deeper</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.080" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">into this becoming</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.839" end="01:09:48.319" style="s2">in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">harvest the collective uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.319" end="01:09:54.719" style="s2">intelligence in this group</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:57.840" style="s2">and to see how such of a facilitation</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.719" end="01:10:00.400" style="s2">is is is possible</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.840" end="01:10:02.320" style="s2">and we did some interesting uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.400" end="01:10:04.320" style="s2">experimentation in this direction at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.320" end="01:10:07.760" style="s2">emerge gathering in kiev last year</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.320" end="01:10:09.760" style="s2">and we came even even further here uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.760" end="01:10:10.800" style="s2">during this in this small group at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.760" end="01:10:14.320" style="s2">exhaust</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.800" end="01:10:17.920" style="s2">so i&#39;m very interested to see</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.320" end="01:10:20.960" style="s2">can we as humanity learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">or relearn to</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.960" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">connect together in a deeper</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:33.120" style="s2">personal connection in a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:37.920" style="s2">and then try to understand</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.120" end="01:10:41.920" style="s2">and communicate and together make sense</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.920" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">from that greater whole that emerges</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.920" end="01:10:48.560" style="s2">between us and this is still</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:50.800" style="s2">just very very uh uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.560" end="01:10:52.480" style="s2">early stages but i think it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.800" end="01:10:55.040" style="s2">in that direction we</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.480" end="01:10:55.840" style="s2">we we need to go we we need in this</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.040" end="01:10:58.880" style="s2">transition</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.840" end="01:11:01.840" style="s2">to find</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.880" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">not just new perspectives not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.840" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">develop ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">and mature as individuals but we also</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:10.880" style="s2">need to find</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">new ways of making sense and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.880" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">there of course john verwege is talking</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:17.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:20.320" style="s2">various psycho technologies and</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.760" end="01:11:20.960" style="s2">those psycho technologies needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.960" end="01:11:25.120" style="s2">in a collective sense making so</p>
