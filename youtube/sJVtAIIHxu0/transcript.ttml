<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:05.569" style="s2">and I want to tell you the story today</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.300" end="00:00:09.809" style="s2">that&#39;s at the foundation of Western</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.569" end="00:00:11.790" style="s2">civilization or one of the stories that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.809" end="00:00:13.880" style="s2">the foundation of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.790" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">because I think the Egyptian story</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.880" end="00:00:19.220" style="s2">qualifies and I think the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">story qualifies and so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.220" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">judeo-christian Genesis story which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">think is as it&#39;s a staggering story if</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:35.910" style="s2">you look at the structure of the Old</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.800" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">Testament what what happens first near</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.910" end="00:00:40.950" style="s2">the first is that there&#39;s there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:43.140" style="s2">things that constitute what I think are</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.950" end="00:00:46.620" style="s2">a radical split between different forms</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.140" end="00:00:49.559" style="s2">of time and so one of them is Noah&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.620" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">Flood where all the chaos comes washing</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.559" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">back and the world is remade so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:57.930" style="s2">that like the time before the flood now</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:59.690" style="s2">in more traditional Christian societies</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.930" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">so say a hundred and fifty years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.690" end="00:01:06.240" style="s2">that was definitely considered a special</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">kind of time before the flood compared</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.240" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">after the flood and I think that the Old</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:13.470" style="s2">Testament is set up that way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:15.210" style="s2">also the Tower of Babel so this story of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.470" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">the Tower of Babel where people build a</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.210" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">tower that&#39;s going to reach to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">and God basically stops them by making</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:25.530" style="s2">it unable to communicate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:27.930" style="s2">and then they dispersed around the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.530" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">that&#39;s also a kind of chaos story so</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.930" end="00:01:32.850" style="s2">there&#39;s the Tower of Babel and the story</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:34.590" style="s2">of Noah and then after that then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.850" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">the story of Abraham and what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">that the stories in the Old Testament</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">start to become quasi historical you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:42.329" style="s2">know they&#39;re like they&#39;re like tribal</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.979" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">history in a sense like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.329" end="00:01:46.860" style="s2">mythologized tribal history so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">more than just tribal history but but</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.860" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">before that I think what they are is</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">they&#39;re almost there almost pure</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">archetype and we have no idea how old</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:58.530" style="s2">the stories are so we know that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.610" style="s2">story of creation in Genesis at the at</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.530" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">the beginning of Genesis there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.610" end="00:02:04.110" style="s2">actually two creation stories there and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:07.099" style="s2">they&#39;re timelines don&#39;t exactly match up</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.110" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">and the hypothesis basically is is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.099" end="00:02:13.010" style="s2">one tribal group or or group of tribes</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.010" end="00:02:17.950" style="s2">one creation story and another tribal</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:20.689" style="s2">group or group of tribes had another</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.950" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">tribal creation story and they came</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.689" end="00:02:26.000" style="s2">together and they didn&#39;t really know how</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:27.829" style="s2">to sort out their damn creation stories</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:29.510" style="s2">because they both held them as sacred</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.829" end="00:02:32.390" style="s2">and so what seemed to have happened over</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.510" end="00:02:34.250" style="s2">time was that those stories were told</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.390" end="00:02:37.610" style="s2">and then when they were written down an</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.250" end="00:02:39.500" style="s2">editor they called the redactor tried to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.610" end="00:02:42.950" style="s2">sequence them so they made some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.500" end="00:02:46.690" style="s2">sense and a lot of a lot of the Bible is</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.950" end="00:02:52.430" style="s2">actually the attempt to take diverse</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.690" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">archaic archetypal and quasi historical</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.430" end="00:02:58.359" style="s2">stories and to organize them in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:03:00.650" style="s2">narrative manner while simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.359" end="00:03:02.510" style="s2">minimizing the internal contradictions</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.650" end="00:03:04.609" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very very difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.510" end="00:03:05.900" style="s2">do and it&#39;s not like only one person did</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.609" end="00:03:08.470" style="s2">it thousands of people have participated</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.900" end="00:03:13.340" style="s2">in doing it over huge stretches of time</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.470" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">so the historical element of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.340" end="00:03:21.590" style="s2">is probably roughly in the same of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:24.139" style="s2">same age as the Mesopotamian stories so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.590" end="00:03:26.120" style="s2">you know you can stretch written history</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.139" end="00:03:27.379" style="s2">back about 5,000 years something like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.120" end="00:03:29.269" style="s2">that maybe a little bit farther than</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.379" end="00:03:31.010" style="s2">that so that&#39;s all we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.269" end="00:03:33.290" style="s2">with regards to written history and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.010" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">know people think of 5000 years ago as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.290" end="00:03:39.829" style="s2">long time but it&#39;s not a long time you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">know that&#39;s only 50 100 year old men so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.829" end="00:03:43.160" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting way to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:46.690" style="s2">about it you know that&#39;s that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.160" end="00:03:49.780" style="s2">very long long period of time the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.690" end="00:03:54.230" style="s2">stories before the flood I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.780" end="00:03:56.510" style="s2">there in determinately ancient I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.230" end="00:03:59.000" style="s2">they have their roots in like very very</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.510" end="00:04:01.459" style="s2">early shamanic practices and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.000" end="00:04:02.870" style="s2">associated with ways of thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.459" end="00:04:05.389" style="s2">have characterized people ever since</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.870" end="00:04:08.269" style="s2">they became people everything since they</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.389" end="00:04:11.329" style="s2">became whatever we are there have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.269" end="00:04:12.979" style="s2">human beings like us anatomically</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.329" end="00:04:15.979" style="s2">speaking for about a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.979" end="00:04:19.459" style="s2">thousand years and we&#39;re also a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.979" end="00:04:21.799" style="s2">bit Neanderthal about five percent two</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.459" end="00:04:26.820" style="s2">to five percent something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.799" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">but are anatomically similar ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.820" end="00:04:32.070" style="s2">being around for about 150,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">looks like we discovered fire about two</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.070" end="00:04:36.660" style="s2">million years ago so and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:40.500" style="s2">cooking for two million years</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.660" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">so anyways it kind of gives you a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.500" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">a time frame now the first part of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">there&#39;s basically in the Genesis story</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a story about the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:54.660" style="s2">being and then there&#39;s two stories</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.100" end="00:04:57.480" style="s2">actually and then there&#39;s a story about</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.660" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">the creation of human beings and so the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.480" end="00:05:00.810" style="s2">first part of this story I&#39;m doing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:04.920" style="s2">gonna read this to you because I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.810" end="00:05:11.010" style="s2">it&#39;s too complicated for me to just spin</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.920" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">out spontaneously there are two</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.010" end="00:05:16.440" style="s2">structural elements described in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:18.570" style="s2">first chapter in Genesis chaos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.440" end="00:05:20.910" style="s2">one and heavens and the earth okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.570" end="00:05:25.110" style="s2">there&#39;s two structural elements one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.910" end="00:05:27.480" style="s2">process creation and one actor God or</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.110" end="00:05:29.610" style="s2">the Word of God who&#39;s engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.480" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">process the first structural element</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.610" end="00:05:36.270" style="s2">chaos is signified by a word called this</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:40.350" style="s2">is a Hebrew word tail and that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.270" end="00:05:43.170" style="s2">chaos by Tohu for waste or for matter</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.350" end="00:05:45.780" style="s2">without substance and by the bohu for</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.170" end="00:05:49.590" style="s2">emptiness or confusion so the chaos out</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.780" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">of which God extracts order has those</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.590" end="00:05:57.630" style="s2">elements it&#39;s chaos waste matter without</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">substance and emptiness and confusion so</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.630" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">the interesting there&#39;s a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:04.290" style="s2">element there too right so I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:06.720" style="s2">in in some sense it&#39;s equivalent to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.290" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">chaos that you fall into when everything</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.720" end="00:06:11.310" style="s2">falls apart around you and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:13.410" style="s2">associated with the shamanic idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.310" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">during the shamanic transformation the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.410" end="00:06:17.670" style="s2">shaman goes back to the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:19.740" style="s2">time roughly speaking into the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.670" end="00:06:21.630" style="s2">that precedes the emergence of order and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.740" end="00:06:24.750" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.630" end="00:06:27.510" style="s2">transformation ritual so the chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.750" end="00:06:30.330" style="s2">the chaos that&#39;s conceptualized as the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.510" end="00:06:32.460" style="s2">ground of being is is partly the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.330" end="00:06:34.500" style="s2">potential out of which matter arises but</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.460" end="00:06:36.300" style="s2">it&#39;s also partly the state of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.500" end="00:06:38.669" style="s2">that you&#39;re in when everything when</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.300" end="00:06:39.960" style="s2">order falls apart around you and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.669" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">makes sense if you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.960" end="00:06:41.879" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:44.129" style="s2">the order that&#39;s being described in</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.879" end="00:06:46.469" style="s2">Genesis is the order that makes up being</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.129" end="00:06:48.360" style="s2">and so it makes sense when the order</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.469" end="00:06:50.249" style="s2">that makes up your being collapses that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.360" end="00:06:52.379" style="s2">you&#39;re going to fall into something</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.249" end="00:06:54.719" style="s2">that&#39;s equivalent to the original chaos</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.379" end="00:06:56.279" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.719" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">about it I don&#39;t think it&#39;s metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.279" end="00:07:01.830" style="s2">by the way it&#39;s not metaphorical it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:04.460" style="s2">different way of describing reality so</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.830" end="00:07:06.930" style="s2">it&#39;s like not like a metaphor for matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.460" end="00:07:08.909" style="s2">it&#39;s different than that it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.930" end="00:07:10.710" style="s2">analysis of the structural components of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.909" end="00:07:13.289" style="s2">being and basically what you have is</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.710" end="00:07:14.729" style="s2">chaos order and the thing that mediates</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.289" end="00:07:16.879" style="s2">between them and we&#39;ve talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.729" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">already as being the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.879" end="00:07:24.119" style="s2">tripartite constituents of reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:25.709" style="s2">itself there has to be potential there</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.119" end="00:07:26.999" style="s2">has to be something to interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.709" end="00:07:28.529" style="s2">potential and then there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.999" end="00:07:34.229" style="s2">something to mediate between the two</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.529" end="00:07:36.059" style="s2">things so these three words Tejon Tohu</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.229" end="00:07:38.099" style="s2">and bohu are very interesting for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.059" end="00:07:40.619" style="s2">variety of reasons and profitably bear</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.099" end="00:07:43.139" style="s2">further investigation the canadian rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.619" end="00:07:45.360" style="s2">itzhak marmar stein who has begun to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.139" end="00:07:48.509" style="s2">explain the torah one word at a time</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.360" end="00:07:51.930" style="s2">describes tale by the way tale and</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.509" end="00:07:53.729" style="s2">timeout are the same word okay so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.930" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">worth knowing and that&#39;s I got that from</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.729" end="00:07:58.949" style="s2">Northrop Frye so the tale is a is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:01.319" style="s2">the first syllable of the word timeout</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.949" end="00:08:03.419" style="s2">and so we know that the mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.319" end="00:08:05.370" style="s2">crew some people think the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.419" end="00:08:08.279" style="s2">creation story preceded the creation</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.370" end="00:08:10.139" style="s2">story that&#39;s in the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.279" end="00:08:13.110" style="s2">account but no one really knows there</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.139" end="00:08:15.300" style="s2">was like a slew of creation stories with</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.110" end="00:08:16.979" style="s2">roughly similar sub structures in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.300" end="00:08:19.080" style="s2">Middle East at that time and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.979" end="00:08:21.209" style="s2">Mesopotamian stories a manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.080" end="00:08:23.879" style="s2">it so does the judeo-christian story and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.209" end="00:08:26.430" style="s2">they their temporal order I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.879" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">is actually even calculable because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.430" end="00:08:31.110" style="s2">think they both disappear into</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:32.909" style="s2">prehistory fundamentally so but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.110" end="00:08:35.219" style="s2">very interesting to know that the tale</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.909" end="00:08:36.779" style="s2">Miz associated with the idea of time map</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.219" end="00:08:38.639" style="s2">because it also gives you some idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.779" end="00:08:40.769" style="s2">the because you don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.639" end="00:08:42.389" style="s2">ancient Hebrew words mean right well how</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.769" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">do you know that you&#39;re not there</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.389" end="00:08:46.500" style="s2">anymore and so it&#39;s interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">the association Network so you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.500" end="00:08:51.209" style="s2">understand the concepts and so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:53.820" style="s2">the tale ms which is this pre-existent</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.209" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">chaos is sort of like Tiamat who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.820" end="00:08:58.410" style="s2">terrible thing that raises up her head</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">when chaos is coming back it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.410" end="00:09:03.090" style="s2">thing that that Marduk has to confront</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:05.340" style="s2">with his eyes open and that Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.090" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">figure is very much like the Word of God</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.340" end="00:09:11.070" style="s2">in the judeo-christian story because the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">Word of God is the thing that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.070" end="00:09:14.910" style="s2">it&#39;s exploratory and communicative and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that right that raises</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.910" end="00:09:20.220" style="s2">order out of chaos so I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:22.290" style="s2">you can understand that without</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.220" end="00:09:24.360" style="s2">understanding or I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.290" end="00:09:26.910" style="s2">understanding the Mesopotamian story and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.360" end="00:09:29.280" style="s2">the role of Marduk in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.910" end="00:09:31.350" style="s2">time outs sheds a substantial amount of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.280" end="00:09:33.090" style="s2">light on the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.350" end="00:09:36.420" style="s2">Word of God and the initial chaos</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.090" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">they&#39;re parallel ideas so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.420" end="00:09:39.390" style="s2">things that I should tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">Christianity which is which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.390" end="00:09:46.350" style="s2">incomprehensible to me I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:48.510" style="s2">understand it is that so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.350" end="00:09:51.540" style="s2">representations of the Word of God that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.510" end="00:09:53.700" style="s2">extracts order out of chaos is logos and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.540" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">that&#39;s partly the root word of logic but</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.700" end="00:09:57.180" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot more than that logos</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">basically means something like it means</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.180" end="00:10:01.830" style="s2">something like heroic confrontation with</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:04.020" style="s2">the unknown and the communication of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.830" end="00:10:06.750" style="s2">results thereof it&#39;s it means roughly</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.020" end="00:10:10.020" style="s2">that and one of the things that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.750" end="00:10:11.910" style="s2">Christians did was assimilate Christ to</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.020" end="00:10:14.220" style="s2">the logos that existed at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.910" end="00:10:17.520" style="s2">of time it&#39;s a very very strange idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.220" end="00:10:20.310" style="s2">and it&#39;s a kind of mystical or artistic</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.520" end="00:10:21.840" style="s2">insight that&#39;s difficult to - it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.310" end="00:10:25.020" style="s2">difficult to understand how that idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.840" end="00:10:27.060" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even happen and so so in some</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.020" end="00:10:29.220" style="s2">sense what the Christians did with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:31.710" style="s2">idea of logos by associating that with</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.220" end="00:10:34.680" style="s2">Christ was to make Christ who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.710" end="00:10:36.570" style="s2">redeemer figure into the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.680" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">generated order out of chaos at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.570" end="00:10:42.090" style="s2">beginning of time and so that part kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:44.430" style="s2">of puts them in the same conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.090" end="00:10:47.550" style="s2">class as Horus and in the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.430" end="00:10:49.320" style="s2">conceptual class as Marduk and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.550" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">you later that it also puts them in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.320" end="00:10:54.750" style="s2">same conceptual class as Buddha but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:57.090" style="s2">get to that story later so so also what</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.750" end="00:10:59.820" style="s2">that means is that there&#39;s an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.090" end="00:11:04.860" style="s2">that lurks latent lis in Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.820" end="00:11:06.750" style="s2">that the ideal person is a and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.860" end="00:11:07.710" style="s2">partly the person who accepts the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.750" end="00:11:09.540" style="s2">necessity of death</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.710" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">and rebirth as part of the redemptive</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.540" end="00:11:13.650" style="s2">process is identical to the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:16.020" style="s2">at the beginning of time called order</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.650" end="00:11:18.330" style="s2">out of chaos it&#39;s a phenomenal</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.020" end="00:11:19.950" style="s2">conception and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.330" end="00:11:23.610" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to argue in a paper that no</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.950" end="00:11:26.040" style="s2">one&#39;s ever read is that the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.610" end="00:11:27.810" style="s2">Western culture is predicated on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.040" end="00:11:30.210" style="s2">idea that human beings have an</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.810" end="00:11:31.860" style="s2">unalterable divinity which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.210" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">the source of their natural rights is</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.860" end="00:11:36.840" style="s2">because it&#39;s predicated on the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:38.790" style="s2">the individual consciousness partakes of</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.840" end="00:11:41.550" style="s2">the process that&#39;s capable of pulling</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.790" end="00:11:43.350" style="s2">order out of chaos or capable of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.550" end="00:11:44.490" style="s2">mediating between the two and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.350" end="00:11:47.670" style="s2">there&#39;s something that&#39;s literally</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.490" end="00:11:50.340" style="s2">divine about that and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.670" end="00:11:53.580" style="s2">that i also promote in this paper is</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.340" end="00:11:55.950" style="s2">that you all believe that because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.580" end="00:11:57.930" style="s2">act on it like you accept the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.950" end="00:11:59.430" style="s2">that there are natural rights and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.930" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">people have individual rights and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.430" end="00:12:04.410" style="s2">they have intrinsic value you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.940" style="s2">why and you don&#39;t know what that idea is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.410" end="00:12:08.940" style="s2">predicated on from a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.940" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">perspective but you do accept it and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.940" end="00:12:12.720" style="s2">do act it out and so to me what that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.970" style="s2">means is you believe it whether you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.720" end="00:12:17.250" style="s2">it or not now you can argue about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.970" end="00:12:19.560" style="s2">because you could argue about what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.250" end="00:12:21.660" style="s2">means to believe something but I tend to</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.560" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">think that belief exists in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.660" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">to action rather than into what in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:27.840" style="s2">relationship to objective</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:29.700" style="s2">conceptualization and so the idea and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.840" end="00:12:31.830" style="s2">then there&#39;s a very interesting little</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.700" end="00:12:34.590" style="s2">twist in the Genesis story because what</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.830" end="00:12:37.530" style="s2">happens when God makes man and woman and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.590" end="00:12:40.290" style="s2">this is a very bizarre thing is that he</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.530" end="00:12:43.110" style="s2">basically says that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.290" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">made in the image of God now God in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.110" end="00:12:46.890" style="s2">particular story is plural but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:49.140" style="s2">not really relevant to our to our</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.890" end="00:12:50.820" style="s2">concerns and I think that&#39;s remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.140" end="00:12:52.140" style="s2">in a variety of ways because number one</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.820" end="00:12:55.050" style="s2">well we don&#39;t exactly know what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.140" end="00:12:57.090" style="s2">image of God means but we can place that</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.090" end="00:13:01.740" style="s2">the Word of God that that extracted</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.730" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">order out of chaos and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.740" end="00:13:08.580" style="s2">seems to intimate is that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:11.130" style="s2">capacity of the human being to extract</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.580" end="00:13:14.670" style="s2">order from chaos that&#39;s equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.130" end="00:13:17.010" style="s2">divinity perhaps in a reduced form and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.670" end="00:13:19.770" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a I think we believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.010" end="00:13:20.860" style="s2">that I think that we believe that and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.770" end="00:13:23.529" style="s2">think it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.860" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">even worse than that and then the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.529" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">thing that so damn bizarre about that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not just men it&#39;s women too and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:32.620" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:36.959" style="s2">have a very difficult time accounting</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.620" end="00:13:39.700" style="s2">for because I don&#39;t understand why a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.959" end="00:13:43.120" style="s2">society that was as deeply patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.700" end="00:13:44.829" style="s2">as say the H Jewish Society why in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.120" end="00:13:47.110" style="s2">world that that would also be attributed</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.829" end="00:13:49.240" style="s2">to women but it is anyway so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:51.730" style="s2">matter so there you know that the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.240" end="00:13:53.399" style="s2">the identity with God is equally</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.730" end="00:13:56.040" style="s2">distributed between men and women so</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.399" end="00:13:59.579" style="s2">that&#39;s quite cool so anyways back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.040" end="00:14:04.019" style="s2">Rabbi it&#39;s Jack marmar Stein</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.579" end="00:14:06.370" style="s2">he describes tale as the unfathomable</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.019" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">undifferentiated womb out of which</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.370" end="00:14:12.970" style="s2">existence as we experience it emerges</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">all potential exists in this primordial</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:19.690" style="s2">energy or state so it&#39;s potential so in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:21.490" style="s2">some sense that&#39;s what the chaos is</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.690" end="00:14:23.019" style="s2">potential and so I&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.490" end="00:14:24.670" style="s2">about that for a long time too because</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.019" end="00:14:27.610" style="s2">it seems to me that what people actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.670" end="00:14:29.200" style="s2">interact with is potential you know we</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.610" end="00:14:31.089" style="s2">think we interact with matter but I</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.200" end="00:14:32.890" style="s2">don&#39;t think we do I think we interact</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.089" end="00:14:35.560" style="s2">with all the various possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.890" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">matter might manifest and that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.560" end="00:14:40.180" style="s2">same thing so that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:42.339" style="s2">interfacing with your existence what</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.180" end="00:14:44.890" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is taking a very large</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.339" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">number of potential futures which are</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.890" end="00:14:50.920" style="s2">basically laid out in front of you and</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:53.350" style="s2">actualizing one or the other as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.920" end="00:14:55.870" style="s2">of your choice and so I think the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.350" end="00:14:58.089" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with isn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.870" end="00:15:00.820" style="s2">it&#39;s the multiple potential states that</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.089" end="00:15:02.500" style="s2">matter could manifest itself in and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.820" end="00:15:04.510" style="s2">think that&#39;s what we call potential and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.500" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">consciousness seems to collapse that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.510" end="00:15:12.250" style="s2">into an action into into actuality so</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:14.709" style="s2">all potential exists in this primordial</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.250" end="00:15:16.870" style="s2">energy or state metaphorically it is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.709" end="00:15:19.510" style="s2">confused seething mass the abyss the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.870" end="00:15:23.949" style="s2">deep and the surging bellowing of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.510" end="00:15:26.019" style="s2">waves Tohu similarly is a chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.949" end="00:15:27.850" style="s2">condition so that&#39;s interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.019" end="00:15:32.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a psychological element there or</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.850" end="00:15:34.170" style="s2">a place without color or form or more</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.529" end="00:15:36.630" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.170" end="00:15:40.890" style="s2">something that seems to for a moment to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.630" end="00:15:43.950" style="s2">have form but when looked at again loses</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.890" end="00:15:47.130" style="s2">that form toh who is the subjective</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.950" end="00:15:49.230" style="s2">effect of chaos the force that confounds</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.130" end="00:15:51.240" style="s2">people and that causes them to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.230" end="00:15:53.100" style="s2">misleading visions so it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.240" end="00:15:55.529" style="s2">psychological in nature that that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.100" end="00:15:57.390" style="s2">particular concept and then verbo who</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.529" end="00:15:59.880" style="s2">finally is related to toh who I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.390" end="00:16:02.190" style="s2">I&#39;m pronouncing those wrong but means</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.880" end="00:16:05.850" style="s2">more specifically the indistinct</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.190" end="00:16:08.100" style="s2">entangled confused mass that all forms</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.850" end="00:16:11.329" style="s2">once were prior to their division into</p>

<p begin="00:16:19.720" end="00:16:28.330" style="s2">so the heavens and the earth so those</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.730" end="00:16:30.340" style="s2">are the next elements so apart from the</p>

<p begin="00:19:16.390" end="00:19:20.740" style="s2">the reasons I started to explore this</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.040" end="00:19:23.380" style="s2">was because you know I was very obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.740" end="00:19:26.110" style="s2">as you all know with the dynamic</p>

<p begin="00:19:36.750" end="00:19:42.310" style="s2">predicated themselves on arbitrary axiom</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.940" end="00:19:44.020" style="s2">so arbitrary descriptions of right and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.310" end="00:19:45.760" style="s2">wrong and that basically what was</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.020" end="00:19:47.530" style="s2">happening was that there was a war to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.760" end="00:19:50.350" style="s2">see which of those arbitrary systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.530" end="00:19:52.330" style="s2">would dominate but I thought well if</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.330" end="00:19:55.960" style="s2">we&#39;re really in trouble because the only</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.370" end="00:20:05.080" style="s2">the only way that could be possibly</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.720" end="00:20:06.910" style="s2">settled is by brute force so then I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.080" end="00:20:08.560" style="s2">thought well what if I look into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.910" end="00:20:10.300" style="s2">origins of the ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.560" end="00:20:11.860" style="s2">characteristic of the West we know where</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.300" end="00:20:13.540" style="s2">the bloody communist ideas came from</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.860" end="00:20:16.180" style="s2">because they were written down by Marx</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.540" end="00:20:18.100" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty obvious but the ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.180" end="00:20:19.960" style="s2">things like natural rights and in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.100" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">West they&#39;re very peculiar ideas they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.960" end="00:20:24.400" style="s2">obviously metaphysical ideas and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">you might ask yourself well are those</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.400" end="00:20:30.760" style="s2">mere arbitrary statements or is there</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:32.410" style="s2">something deeper underneath them and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.760" end="00:20:34.030" style="s2">that&#39;s partly what led me back to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.410" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">analysis of these texts for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.030" end="00:20:38.050" style="s2">because the ideas emerged out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:40.470" style="s2">text it&#39;s not like somebody just sat</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.050" end="00:20:43.180" style="s2">around and thought the damn things up</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.470" end="00:20:45.070" style="s2">there are very very old ideas and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.180" end="00:20:47.049" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look to me like the matrix that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.070" end="00:20:48.460" style="s2">they emerged out of was actually a made</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.049" end="00:20:50.799" style="s2">tricks of ideas it was more like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.460" end="00:20:53.529" style="s2">matrix of behavior and it&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.799" end="00:20:56.249" style="s2">thousands and thousands of years and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.529" end="00:20:58.899" style="s2">that&#39;s when I started to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.249" end="00:21:01.299" style="s2">the conception of the individual in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.899" end="00:21:03.820" style="s2">West is something like that which</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.299" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">mediates between order and chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.820" end="00:21:10.259" style="s2">that that&#39;s not merely uh that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:12.129" style="s2">ontological statement rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.259" end="00:21:13.690" style="s2">theoretical statement it&#39;s a statement</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.129" end="00:21:17.830" style="s2">about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.690" end="00:21:19.149" style="s2">not about models so to speak and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.830" end="00:21:20.559" style="s2">know I would add to that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.149" end="00:21:22.149" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand a damn thing about</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.559" end="00:21:24.759" style="s2">consciousness except that it clearly</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.149" end="00:21:26.980" style="s2">exists and that it also seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.759" end="00:21:29.169" style="s2">be phenomenally logically accurate I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.980" end="00:21:30.909" style="s2">mean when you guys are you&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.169" end="00:21:33.999" style="s2">this situation right now and probably</p>

<p begin="00:21:36.039" end="00:21:42.100" style="s2">front of you is a huge field of on map</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.649" end="00:21:44.139" style="s2">potential and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.100" end="00:21:46.299" style="s2">there&#39;s no other way of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.139" end="00:21:48.039" style="s2">that&#39;s more accurate so we could just</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.299" end="00:21:49.989" style="s2">assume that that is what confronts you</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.039" end="00:21:52.869" style="s2">and then what you&#39;re doing as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.989" end="00:21:55.029" style="s2">navigate your way through it in one form</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.869" end="00:21:57.999" style="s2">or another is actualizing that potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.029" end="00:22:00.789" style="s2">into some into some reality that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.999" end="00:22:02.409" style="s2">inhabit that is hopefully operating in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.789" end="00:22:04.600" style="s2">accordance with what you both need and</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.409" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2">want but you certainly view yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.600" end="00:22:09.789" style="s2">at least to some degree as a being that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:11.889" style="s2">is capable of doing that it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.789" end="00:22:13.239" style="s2">I mean you assume that you can choose</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.889" end="00:22:14.679" style="s2">what you&#39;re going to do after you go to</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.239" end="00:22:18.639" style="s2">university like you don&#39;t have infinite</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.679" end="00:22:20.679" style="s2">choice and it seems perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.639" end="00:22:22.869" style="s2">to presume that that&#39;s anxiety-provoking</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.679" end="00:22:25.389" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t it be we also know from the</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.159" end="00:22:43.539" style="s2">all right the fundamental story of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.859" end="00:22:45.129" style="s2">first part of Genesis is predicated on</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.539" end="00:22:47.559" style="s2">the assumption that chaos can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.129" end="00:22:49.600" style="s2">conceptualized as a matrix as something</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.559" end="00:22:52.509" style="s2">with a metaphorically female aspect a</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.600" end="00:22:55.090" style="s2">matrix by the way that&#39;s a matrix is</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.509" end="00:22:57.700" style="s2">something out of which matter arises</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.090" end="00:23:00.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the same word matrix matter mother</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.700" end="00:23:01.720" style="s2">those are all the same words and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.220" end="00:23:03.820" style="s2">the things that&#39;s very interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.720" end="00:23:05.980" style="s2">the word matter is that we use it in two</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.820" end="00:23:09.700" style="s2">ways right and I think it&#39;s a reflection</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.980" end="00:23:11.860" style="s2">of the touhou boohoo divide one thing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.700" end="00:23:13.480" style="s2">things are made out of matter and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.860" end="00:23:16.710" style="s2">the other thing is that things matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.480" end="00:23:18.730" style="s2">and part of the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.710" end="00:23:21.610" style="s2">conceptualization of matter is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.730" end="00:23:25.929" style="s2">partly matter and partly what matters</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.610" end="00:23:28.419" style="s2">and part of the old testament</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.929" end="00:23:31.150" style="s2">conceptually conceptualization of matter</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.419" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">is that the world is made out of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.150" end="00:23:38.169" style="s2">matters so and i again i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:39.970" style="s2">that&#39;s a metaphor i think your nerve I</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.169" end="00:23:42.940" style="s2">think your nervous system is actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.970" end="00:23:45.580" style="s2">set up in that manner because the way</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.940" end="00:23:49.059" style="s2">your brain reacts to the world is as if</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.580" end="00:23:50.590" style="s2">it matters and since your brain evolved</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.059" end="00:23:53.020" style="s2">and since we don&#39;t know any other way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.590" end="00:23:56.230" style="s2">producing an entity that can adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.020" end="00:23:58.330" style="s2">reality without evolution then the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.230" end="00:24:00.370" style="s2">that your brain evolved to treat the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.330" end="00:24:02.440" style="s2">world as if it matters would indicate</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.370" end="00:24:05.140" style="s2">that the reason for that is because it</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.440" end="00:24:08.770" style="s2">matters and I don&#39;t see any way out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.140" end="00:24:10.360" style="s2">that argument so that because the normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.770" end="00:24:13.020" style="s2">argument is the physical substrate is</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.360" end="00:24:14.980" style="s2">primary and anything that matters is</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.020" end="00:24:18.549" style="s2">epiphenomena right that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.980" end="00:24:20.140" style="s2">subjective or qualia but I don&#39;t see any</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.549" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">evidence whatsoever that that&#39;s how your</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.140" end="00:24:23.980" style="s2">brain is organized I think all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.480" style="s2">evidence suggests the opposite and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.980" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">what you&#39;re first attracted to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.480" end="00:24:31.720" style="s2">matters and then you parse it out into</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:33.610" style="s2">the world so so good you try untangling</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.720" end="00:24:36.600" style="s2">that but I haven&#39;t been able to untangle</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.610" end="00:24:36.600" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.230" end="00:25:02.710" style="s2">right right well you know yeah but that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.970" end="00:25:05.770" style="s2">is hard a girl&#39;s point is that that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.710" end="00:25:07.690" style="s2">meaning manifests itself that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.770" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">why he&#39;s a phenomenologist because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.690" end="00:25:11.620" style="s2">root word of phenomenology is famous</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">thigh which means to shine forth and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.620" end="00:25:18.100" style="s2">it&#39;s the a priori state right and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.100" end="00:25:21.850" style="s2">know I think that you can assimilate</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.100" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">those theories to ideas like the root</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.850" end="00:25:25.840" style="s2">the ground of existence is something</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">like information rather than something</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.840" end="00:25:29.470" style="s2">like matter it&#39;s actually not like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:30.790" style="s2">matter because what&#39;s ever at the ground</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.470" end="00:25:32.110" style="s2">of the world we have no idea about</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.790" end="00:25:35.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even act like matter</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.110" end="00:25:37.990" style="s2">it&#39;s very strange stuff but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.770" end="00:25:41.070" style="s2">acts at least as much like information</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.990" end="00:25:41.070" style="s2">as it does like matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.650" end="00:26:31.460" style="s2">right right well that yes that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.750" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">reflection of the idea that limited</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.460" end="00:26:36.200" style="s2">limitation has utility you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.840" style="s2">that or that even that limitation is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.200" end="00:26:40.730" style="s2">precondition for meaning or or more I</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.840" end="00:26:43.670" style="s2">think limitation is a precondition for</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.730" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">being so one of the things that that led</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.670" end="00:26:50.000" style="s2">me to conclude is that there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:52.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a logic in that if</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.000" end="00:26:58.880" style="s2">there can&#39;t be being without limitation</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.580" end="00:27:01.760" style="s2">and limitation produces tragedy then how</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.880" end="00:27:04.910" style="s2">is it possible to have being that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.760" end="00:27:06.830" style="s2">acceptable and I think the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.910" end="00:27:09.950" style="s2">that is well that&#39;s what the redemptive</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.830" end="00:27:12.410" style="s2">question is the the root of morality</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.950" end="00:27:14.540" style="s2">that the essence of morality is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.410" end="00:27:19.340" style="s2">determine how to live so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.540" end="00:27:21.830" style="s2">have being with with tragedy held in</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.340" end="00:27:24.920" style="s2">abeyance sufficiently so that the being</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.830" end="00:27:27.080" style="s2">is worth having it&#39;s a very tricky thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.920" end="00:27:29.450" style="s2">to do because the tragedy is built into</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.080" end="00:27:33.340" style="s2">the being and I think that what</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.450" end="00:27:36.800" style="s2">redemptive systems attempt to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.340" end="00:27:41.000" style="s2">portray they&#39;re a form of discovery is</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.800" end="00:27:43.130" style="s2">how that human being could what its</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.000" end="00:27:45.590" style="s2">structure is and part of it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.130" end="00:27:48.560" style="s2">have to do with truth you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.590" end="00:27:50.810" style="s2">confront the thing that&#39;s tragic because</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.560" end="00:27:53.360" style="s2">otherwise you can&#39;t deal with it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.810" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">a big that&#39;s a huge part of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.360" end="00:27:57.500" style="s2">you have to communicate the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:27:58.310" style="s2">of that to others that&#39;s not all of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.500" end="00:28:00.290" style="s2">but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.310" end="00:28:03.250" style="s2">big part of it that&#39;s the logos part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.290" end="00:28:11.090" style="s2">it you know you have to embody the logos</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.250" end="00:28:13.810" style="s2">fundamentally so okay so now I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.090" end="00:28:16.850" style="s2">move from the initial part which is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.810" end="00:28:20.930" style="s2">the creation of something out of nothing</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:22.910" style="s2">the origins of order itself I want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.930" end="00:28:24.860" style="s2">concentrate on the story of Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.910" end="00:28:27.350" style="s2">and the reason I want to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.860" end="00:28:29.330" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s an unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.350" end="00:28:31.100" style="s2">illuminating story in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.330" end="00:28:33.260" style="s2">the Mesopotamian story is illuminating</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.100" end="00:28:35.630" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s staggering the degree</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.260" end="00:28:37.940" style="s2">to which the information in it has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.630" end="00:28:41.630" style="s2">compressed now I think what happens it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.940" end="00:28:43.280" style="s2">something like this people are always</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.630" end="00:28:46.100" style="s2">telling stories about one thing or</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.280" end="00:28:48.650" style="s2">another and they tell stories down the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.100" end="00:28:50.750" style="s2">generations and I think what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.650" end="00:28:54.020" style="s2">that as stories are handed down across</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.750" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">the generations all that remains of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.020" end="00:28:59.330" style="s2">stories is those elements that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:29:01.160" style="s2">forgotten and so what that means is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.330" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">there&#39;s something centrally meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.160" end="00:29:04.310" style="s2">about those elements because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:05.750" style="s2">you remember you remember what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.310" end="00:29:08.510" style="s2">meaningful you get rid of what isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.750" end="00:29:10.460" style="s2">right so if I tell you the story of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.510" end="00:29:12.050" style="s2">I did today and you go off to someone</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.460" end="00:29:14.210" style="s2">else and you retell the story you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.050" end="00:29:16.280" style="s2">gonna compress it down to just a few</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.210" end="00:29:18.140" style="s2">lines and those are the few lines that</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.280" end="00:29:20.390" style="s2">in some sense seem to sum up the entire</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.140" end="00:29:22.910" style="s2">story and that&#39;s the part you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.390" end="00:29:24.740" style="s2">forget so then you might ask if if a</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.910" end="00:29:27.650" style="s2">thousand people tell a story for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.740" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">thousand years what&#39;s left of the story</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.650" end="00:29:31.040" style="s2">and the straightforward answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:33.200" style="s2">seems to be well it&#39;s the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.040" end="00:29:34.310" style="s2">story that nobody can forget and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.200" end="00:29:37.280" style="s2">would be the part of the story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.310" end="00:29:39.170" style="s2">most richly meaningful now why precisely</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.280" end="00:29:40.430" style="s2">it would be richly meaningful I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.170" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole different question I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.430" end="00:29:44.210" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how to answer that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:46.640" style="s2">think to some degree it echoes in people</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.210" end="00:29:48.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.640" end="00:29:50.090" style="s2">understand that exactly you know when</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.230" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">you go to a movie and the movie will</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.090" end="00:29:53.300" style="s2">reach a climax and all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:54.770" style="s2">little it&#39;ll produce an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.300" end="00:29:56.510" style="s2">release in you you know maybe you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.770" end="00:29:59.420" style="s2">start to cry it doesn&#39;t mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:30:01.250" style="s2">exactly why it&#39;s something in you is</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.420" end="00:30:03.320" style="s2">responding to it so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.250" end="00:30:05.510" style="s2">echoing in you in some sense so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.320" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">might even say that the structure of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.510" end="00:30:11.570" style="s2">story comes to match the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:13.909" style="s2">your caring it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.570" end="00:30:35.869" style="s2">so it&#39;s a mirror of your psyche and in</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.909" end="00:30:38.570" style="s2">some way is well partly we there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.869" end="00:30:41.929" style="s2">actual ways we do know that because</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.570" end="00:30:46.309" style="s2">there are first of all what tends to</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.929" end="00:30:48.889" style="s2">happen in the historical story is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.309" end="00:30:52.549" style="s2">it isn&#39;t changed that&#39;s the rule its its</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.889" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">permanence so for example grizzly bears</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.549" end="00:30:57.349" style="s2">now and grizzly bears 150 thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:30:59.299" style="s2">ago they&#39;re the same and roughly</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.349" end="00:31:01.489" style="s2">speaking the farther you go back in time</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.299" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">the more people are the same from one</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.489" end="00:31:05.359" style="s2">generation to another</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:07.399" style="s2">they don&#39;t change at all so for example</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.359" end="00:31:09.649" style="s2">among the Australian Aborigines before</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.399" end="00:31:11.450" style="s2">the Europeans came there&#39;s not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.649" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">evidence of cultural transformation over</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.450" end="00:31:15.289" style="s2">a twenty five thousand year period and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.659" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think we really understand</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.289" end="00:31:20.269" style="s2">the degree to which a static culture is</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.659" end="00:31:22.009" style="s2">actually static the same thing just</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.269" end="00:31:24.499" style="s2">happens over and over and the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.009" end="00:31:26.239" style="s2">stories are told and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.499" end="00:31:29.210" style="s2">they&#39;re told in exactly the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.239" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">the as the the the story or the game</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.210" end="00:31:33.409" style="s2">that you&#39;re describing because first of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:36.889" style="s2">all the knowledge is distributed to some</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.409" end="00:31:38.389" style="s2">degree in everyone so even if you told a</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.889" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">part of the story and you told it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.389" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">then someone else is going to correct</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">you so the story is actually distributed</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:47.899" style="s2">throughout the entire society so so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:51.769" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s nearly as fragile as</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.899" end="00:31:53.720" style="s2">people assume now I don&#39;t obviously</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.769" end="00:31:55.609" style="s2">there are times in history where those</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.720" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">things start to transform quite rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.609" end="00:32:01.299" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s what happens when the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:03.409" style="s2">population starts to grow and diverse</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.299" end="00:32:05.570" style="s2">separated communities start to come back</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.409" end="00:32:07.340" style="s2">together and then the stories start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.570" end="00:32:11.299" style="s2">transform but other than that I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.340" end="00:32:13.729" style="s2">the the a priori condition is stability</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.299" end="00:32:16.309" style="s2">not transformation now we do know for</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.729" end="00:32:19.429" style="s2">example there&#39;s a group of people on in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.309" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">northern Japan called the a new and God</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.429" end="00:32:24.200" style="s2">only knows where they came from there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">all sorts of theories about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.200" end="00:32:27.110" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:29.179" style="s2">about the a new is that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.110" end="00:32:31.970" style="s2">ceremony that involves the worship of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.179" end="00:32:35.029" style="s2">bears that seems to have exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.970" end="00:32:36.590" style="s2">same structure as the structures of bear</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.029" end="00:32:40.070" style="s2">worship that have been found in</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.590" end="00:32:41.720" style="s2">Neolithic caves in Western Europe so the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.070" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">way the Bears skull is set up on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.720" end="00:32:46.250" style="s2">altar and so forth is the same as the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:47.659" style="s2">caves that were discovered in Western</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.250" end="00:32:50.380" style="s2">Europe even though there&#39;s a gap of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.659" end="00:32:53.330" style="s2">approximately twenty five thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.380" end="00:32:55.429" style="s2">so so I don&#39;t think that broken</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.330" end="00:32:59.000" style="s2">telephone analogy is quite right because</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.429" end="00:33:02.389" style="s2">that&#39;s only its sentence-level first</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.000" end="00:33:04.519" style="s2">usually and the only person who knows</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.389" end="00:33:06.440" style="s2">the message to begin with is one person</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.519" end="00:33:10.340" style="s2">and there&#39;s no context for the message</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.440" end="00:33:12.049" style="s2">so it&#39;s an interesting analogy and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.340" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">also think some of its useful because I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.049" end="00:33:16.820" style="s2">do think stories transform themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:18.529" style="s2">across time to some degree even with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.820" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">retelling because the language is going</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.529" end="00:33:23.179" style="s2">to shift and move and so forth but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:25.669" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.179" end="00:33:30.159" style="s2">default position is noise I think we</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.669" end="00:33:33.399" style="s2">should assume that it&#39;s signal so okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.159" end="00:33:33.399" style="s2">Adam and Eve</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.260" end="00:33:43.460" style="s2">the first thing that happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.080" end="00:33:45.850" style="s2">they were both naked the man and his</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.460" end="00:33:48.920" style="s2">wife and were not ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.850" end="00:33:51.020" style="s2">so the first thing you might ask is well</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.920" end="00:33:54.370" style="s2">what is meant by naked and what is meant</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.020" end="00:33:57.140" style="s2">by ashamed and so then you think well</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.370" end="00:33:58.700" style="s2">there&#39;s a number of things about people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.140" end="00:34:02.450" style="s2">that are quite peculiar and one is that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.700" end="00:34:04.910" style="s2">we&#39;re clothed and although there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.450" end="00:34:07.550" style="s2">some people who go about naked it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.910" end="00:34:14.900" style="s2">the standard human position in the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.550" end="00:34:19.970" style="s2">in fact you can actually trace the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.900" end="00:34:23.210" style="s2">origin of cloth using the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.970" end="00:34:24.800" style="s2">structure of lice because there are some</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.210" end="00:34:27.560" style="s2">lights who have evolved to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.800" end="00:34:30.830" style="s2">cloth and not hair and they&#39;ve tracked</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.560" end="00:34:32.660" style="s2">the DNA development the genetic</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.830" end="00:34:35.150" style="s2">development of those lights back more</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.660" end="00:34:38.210" style="s2">than twenty five thousand years so</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.150" end="00:34:39.950" style="s2">people use cloth and they use it well</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.210" end="00:34:41.390" style="s2">they use it obviously for protection but</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.950" end="00:34:43.190" style="s2">they also use it for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.390" end="00:34:44.990" style="s2">symbolic routines but the point is is</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.190" end="00:34:47.120" style="s2">that there it does seem to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.990" end="00:34:49.640" style="s2">particularly human relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.120" end="00:34:54.530" style="s2">idea of nakedness now you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.640" end="00:34:57.170" style="s2">yourself why and what does it mean that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.530" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">that the original people might have been</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.170" end="00:35:01.460" style="s2">naked and not ashamed and why would that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.540" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">be a surprise to the readers because</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.460" end="00:35:05.570" style="s2">obviously one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:07.490" style="s2">sentence presumes is that the reader is</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.570" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">going to assume that the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.490" end="00:35:11.210" style="s2">men and women who were naked were not</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:15.410" style="s2">ashamed is actually a deviation from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.210" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">norm so here&#39;s what I&#39;ve made of it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.410" end="00:35:24.950" style="s2">you can tell me what you think first of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:26.750" style="s2">all they weren&#39;t self-conscious now you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.950" end="00:35:28.820" style="s2">might ask well what would that have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.750" end="00:35:30.680" style="s2">do with nakedness and I would say well a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.820" end="00:35:31.850" style="s2">huge chunk of white people don&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.680" end="00:35:34.430" style="s2">around naked is because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.850" end="00:35:37.730" style="s2">self-conscious and there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.430" end="00:35:40.130" style="s2">reasons for that is that well human</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.730" end="00:35:41.840" style="s2">beings are standing up first of all like</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.130" end="00:35:44.060" style="s2">unlike other animals and so the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.840" end="00:35:45.590" style="s2">vulnerable parts of us are exposed not</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.060" end="00:35:47.900" style="s2">only to the world but directly to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.590" end="00:35:49.850" style="s2">view of other people and so most animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.900" end="00:35:51.390" style="s2">run around on all four and that means</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.850" end="00:35:54.029" style="s2">they basically have armor</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.390" end="00:35:57.210" style="s2">roxrite they&#39;re vulnerable parts are not</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.029" end="00:36:00.690" style="s2">full center in front for everyone to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.210" end="00:36:02.609" style="s2">so human beings also mate face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.690" end="00:36:10.010" style="s2">although they don&#39;t have to and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.609" end="00:36:13.069" style="s2">also heightened self-consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.010" end="00:36:16.260" style="s2">then in relationship to shame</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.069" end="00:36:18.059" style="s2">shame is actually a emotion that seems</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.260" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">to be manifested under conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.059" end="00:36:22.619" style="s2">judgment and so you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:27.299" style="s2">people are often afraid of public</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.619" end="00:36:32.010" style="s2">speaking why you guys are afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.299" end="00:36:33.089" style="s2">public spirit of public speaking okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:34.890" style="s2">how many of you are completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.089" end="00:36:36.809" style="s2">comfortable with public speaking oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.890" end="00:36:40.049" style="s2">that&#39;s good that&#39;s quite that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.809" end="00:36:46.019" style="s2">amazing so okay so why might people be</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.049" end="00:36:49.460" style="s2">afraid of public speaking you bet that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.019" end="00:36:51.390" style="s2">a lot of eyes looking at you right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.460" end="00:36:53.130" style="s2">often people who are afraid of public</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.390" end="00:36:55.109" style="s2">speaking won&#39;t meet the eyes they look</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.130" end="00:36:56.700" style="s2">down and what that basically means is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.109" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">they&#39;re reacting to the crowd as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.700" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">a predator</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:01.259" style="s2">the best way to overcome that is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:02.789" style="s2">start looking at people and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.259" end="00:37:04.589" style="s2">look at the crowd because there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.789" end="00:37:06.450" style="s2">crowd you look at individuals within the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.589" end="00:37:08.309" style="s2">crowd and then that&#39;s no problem because</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.450" end="00:37:10.799" style="s2">you know how to do that it&#39;s a great way</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.309" end="00:37:15.539" style="s2">to decrease your fear of public speaking</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.799" end="00:37:18.450" style="s2">okay so how about speaking in front of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.539" end="00:37:20.460" style="s2">crowd naked that&#39;s a common nightmare by</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.450" end="00:37:21.380" style="s2">the way so what do you think about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.460" end="00:37:27.000" style="s2">sounds like fun</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.380" end="00:37:37.740" style="s2">no why why right and so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.000" end="00:37:39.660" style="s2">problem with the scrutiny why why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.740" end="00:37:41.670" style="s2">right you have a lot of flaws and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.660" end="00:37:42.630" style="s2">bloody well aware of them you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.670" end="00:37:45.329" style="s2">it&#39;s bad enough to have your</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.630" end="00:37:47.250" style="s2">intellectual flaws revealed but to add</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.329" end="00:37:48.450" style="s2">to that your physical flaws you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.250" end="00:37:50.640" style="s2">when you can think about that as your</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.450" end="00:37:52.710" style="s2">deviation from an implicit ideal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.640" end="00:37:55.440" style="s2">something like that right people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.710" end="00:37:57.630" style="s2">like that that&#39;s why you never except</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.440" end="00:37:59.190" style="s2">for The Naked News you never see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.630" end="00:38:00.299" style="s2">happening or you virtually never see</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.190" end="00:38:03.900" style="s2">that happening except under very</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.299" end="00:38:05.130" style="s2">specific conditions so part of the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.900" end="00:38:07.740" style="s2">issue with being</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.130" end="00:38:10.859" style="s2">naked and ashamed is that the nakedness</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.740" end="00:38:13.380" style="s2">has to do with flaws so you might say</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.859" end="00:38:15.329" style="s2">well what does it mean to see yourself</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.380" end="00:38:16.500" style="s2">as naked well I think what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.329" end="00:38:18.720" style="s2">to see yourself with all your</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.500" end="00:38:20.700" style="s2">vulnerabilities and that&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.720" end="00:38:22.559" style="s2">local vulnerabilities which just happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.700" end="00:38:24.900" style="s2">to be how hideous you are as a physical</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.559" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">entity but then there&#39;s even worse which</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.900" end="00:38:29.039" style="s2">is if you&#39;re really self conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:30.900" style="s2">aware of what it means to be vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.039" end="00:38:33.000" style="s2">because let&#39;s say that&#39;s what&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.900" end="00:38:37.559" style="s2">core of nakedness is you also realize</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.000" end="00:38:40.170" style="s2">you&#39;re flawed and mortal nature across</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.559" end="00:38:42.059" style="s2">time so that&#39;s partly the burden of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.170" end="00:38:44.339" style="s2">fact that you&#39;re physically imperfect in</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.059" end="00:38:45.990" style="s2">degenerating all at the same time and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.339" end="00:38:47.420" style="s2">that&#39;s something that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.990" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">understand and that no other animal</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.420" end="00:38:52.380" style="s2">understands that&#39;s a big deal so I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">partly the reason that we put on clothes</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.380" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">is so we don&#39;t freeze to death when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:59.329" style="s2">cold but part of it also is this to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:01.230" style="s2">separate ourselves from continual</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.329" end="00:39:03.480" style="s2">scrutiny a lot of that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.230" end="00:39:05.339" style="s2">sexual scrutiny - and evaluation we</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.480" end="00:39:07.710" style="s2">shield ourselves from that so that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.339" end="00:39:10.140" style="s2">can do some other things now and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.710" end="00:39:12.900" style="s2">so the original people didn&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:14.519" style="s2">problem so I think they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.900" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">self-conscious that&#39;s the first thing to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.519" end="00:39:23.069" style="s2">notice so ok the next thing that happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:24.450" style="s2">is that the atom is complaining about</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.069" end="00:39:28.200" style="s2">the fact that he doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.450" end="00:39:29.849" style="s2">company right so God does this the Lord</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.200" end="00:39:31.829" style="s2">God caused a deep sleep to fall upon</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.849" end="00:39:33.710" style="s2">Adam and he slept and he took one of his</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.829" end="00:39:36.599" style="s2">ribs and closed up the flesh instead</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.710" end="00:39:39.000" style="s2">thereof and the rib which the Lord God</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.599" end="00:39:41.130" style="s2">had taken from man made he a woman and</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.000" end="00:39:42.930" style="s2">brought her unto the man and Adam said</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.130" end="00:39:45.089" style="s2">this is now bone of my bones and flesh</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.930" end="00:39:47.670" style="s2">of my flesh she shall be called woman</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.089" end="00:39:49.109" style="s2">because she was taken out of man so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.670" end="00:39:51.390" style="s2">want to read you something about this</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.109" end="00:39:53.309" style="s2">because one of the interpretations of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.390" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">that especially feminist interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.309" end="00:39:57.750" style="s2">of the that story is that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.640" style="s2">women subordinate to men and it also</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.750" end="00:40:01.380" style="s2">inverts the natural order because</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.640" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">obviously men come from women rather</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.380" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">than women coming from men and so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">idea there is that that&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:11.099" style="s2">a patriarchal presumption that overthrew</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:13.799" style="s2">the original matriarchal order which</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.099" end="00:40:16.349" style="s2">there was none of by the way that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.799" end="00:40:18.780" style="s2">faulty arc anthropological theory there</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.349" end="00:40:23.370" style="s2">was never a pre patriarchal matriarch</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.780" end="00:40:26.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a misplace myth</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.370" end="00:40:28.890" style="s2">that&#39;s historicize because you know in</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.100" end="00:40:32.550" style="s2">in the scheme that I showed you the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.890" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">feminine is underneath the masculine so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.550" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">to speak right so in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:38.430" style="s2">feminine nature is out of that out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:39.780" style="s2">which culture Springs but that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.430" end="00:40:55.380" style="s2">psychological truth not an</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.780" end="00:40:58.260" style="s2">anthropological truth so it is it is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.380" end="00:41:00.480" style="s2">is yes and but I&#39;m gonna read you why</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.260" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">that is but yes it is exactly that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.480" end="00:41:05.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.650" end="00:41:08.490" style="s2">and it has to do it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.130" end="00:41:12.300" style="s2">idea that the central element of human</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.300" end="00:41:17.190" style="s2">it&#39;s man or woman now logos is are also</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.990" end="00:41:18.960" style="s2">symbolically masculine because it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.970" end="00:41:26.670" style="s2">again it&#39;s too complicated for me to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.770" end="00:41:28.620" style="s2">conjure up on the fly so it is of course</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.670" end="00:41:31.110" style="s2">contrary to the entire scheme of nature</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.620" end="00:41:32.460" style="s2">that woman be derived from man and it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.110" end="00:41:33.900" style="s2">very tempting to read a simple</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.460" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">patriarchal prejudice into that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.900" end="00:41:37.950" style="s2">derivation I think it is more</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:39.930" style="s2">appropriate to give these ancient and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.950" end="00:41:41.670" style="s2">incomprehensible stories the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.930" end="00:41:44.520" style="s2">the doubt and to search for something</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.670" end="00:41:46.380" style="s2">more profound logos is symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.520" end="00:41:48.420" style="s2">masculine and that would be partly</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.380" end="00:41:51.180" style="s2">because of the idea of mardik against</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.420" end="00:41:53.130" style="s2">time at for example there are diverse</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.180" end="00:41:54.990" style="s2">reasons for this that have little to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.130" end="00:41:58.020" style="s2">with simple ideological prejudice or</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.990" end="00:42:00.450" style="s2">with gender per se the profound implicit</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.020" end="00:42:03.390" style="s2">idea put forth in this creation sequence</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.450" end="00:42:06.090" style="s2">woman from man is that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.390" end="00:42:08.730" style="s2">woman rather than the mere female is a</p>

<p begin="00:42:12.270" end="00:42:17.220" style="s2">nature thus the story does not denigrate</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.220" end="00:42:21.690" style="s2">but elevates human being itself man and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.740" end="00:42:24.150" style="s2">woman above it&#39;s simply material and</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.690" end="00:42:27.060" style="s2">symbolically feminine substrate now</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.150" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there was some there</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.060" end="00:42:31.660" style="s2">was a whole series of ancient writings</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:34.060" style="s2">that were uncovered in in</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.660" end="00:42:37.330" style="s2">in the late 1950s that are now called</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.060" end="00:42:41.140" style="s2">the Gnostic Gospels and hypothetically</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.330" end="00:42:45.310" style="s2">their New Testament Gospels of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.140" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">variety of sorts that were that were</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.310" end="00:42:49.120" style="s2">defined as non canonical by what became</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:51.340" style="s2">the Christian Church and so they were</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.120" end="00:42:53.740" style="s2">they all emerged in the late 1950s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.340" end="00:42:55.810" style="s2">a fascinating story because the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.740" end="00:42:57.430" style="s2">who discovered them if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.810" end="00:43:00.220" style="s2">correctly it&#39;s been a long time since I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.430" end="00:43:02.170" style="s2">read this their father had been killed</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.220" end="00:43:04.390" style="s2">by someone and so they went out to find</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.170" end="00:43:06.280" style="s2">the guy who killed him and killed him</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.390" end="00:43:08.290" style="s2">and then they went to a cave Tiberium</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.280" end="00:43:10.480" style="s2">and when they dug in the cave they found</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.290" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">all these amphora that had been buried</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.480" end="00:43:15.310" style="s2">for thousands of years and then they</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:17.020" style="s2">took them home and their mother used a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.310" end="00:43:19.210" style="s2">bunch of the papers that were inside</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.020" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">them to light fires with so the family</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.210" end="00:43:23.260" style="s2">could cook but an antiquities dealer</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:26.290" style="s2">came along and recognized them for what</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.260" end="00:43:28.390" style="s2">they were and squirreled them away now</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.290" end="00:43:30.310" style="s2">weirdly enough and I don&#39;t remember how</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.390" end="00:43:33.340" style="s2">this happened either is that one of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.310" end="00:43:36.700" style="s2">one of these manuscripts called the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.340" end="00:43:38.500" style="s2">Gospel of Thomas made its way to Karl</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.700" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">Yune and he was the only person in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.500" end="00:43:42.130" style="s2">entire world who had access to any of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:43.900" style="s2">the Gnostic Gospels until probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.130" end="00:43:45.490" style="s2">twenty-five years ago when they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.900" end="00:43:47.230" style="s2">finally more or less released to</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:50.440" style="s2">scholars so that&#39;s also extremely</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.230" end="00:43:52.120" style="s2">bizarre so anyways there&#39;s a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.440" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">the Gospel yeah it&#39;s very very bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.120" end="00:43:55.990" style="s2">it&#39;s a very amazing story</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">so anyways there&#39;s all these Gospels and</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.990" end="00:44:00.580" style="s2">now they&#39;ve been translated in various</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.530" style="s2">ways and you can buy them as the Gnostic</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.580" end="00:44:03.840" style="s2">Gospels and the Gnostics were a group of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.530" end="00:44:06.310" style="s2">early Christians who believed that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.840" end="00:44:09.850" style="s2">Redemption could be attained through</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.310" end="00:44:11.380" style="s2">knowledge as much as Redemption could be</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.850" end="00:44:13.750" style="s2">attained through faith and that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.380" end="00:44:16.660" style="s2">basically crushed by the developing</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.750" end="00:44:19.180" style="s2">Christian Church so anyways Young is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.660" end="00:44:20.410" style="s2">often regarded as a kind of Gnostic but</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.180" end="00:44:22.270" style="s2">it&#39;s still it&#39;s really quite remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.410" end="00:44:23.800" style="s2">that he ended up with the Gospel of</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.270" end="00:44:27.010" style="s2">Thomas I think that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.800" end="00:44:29.530" style="s2">incomprehensible fundamentally so a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.010" end="00:44:31.630" style="s2">similar idea this the individual woman</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.530" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">rather than the mere female is a product</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.630" end="00:44:36.850" style="s2">of logos and so there&#39;s an idea in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:38.680" style="s2">Gospel of Thomas and similar ideas put</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.850" end="00:44:42.550" style="s2">forth in the Gospel of Thomas in more</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.680" end="00:44:43.980" style="s2">thoroughly elaborated form Simon Peter</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.550" end="00:44:45.660" style="s2">said to them</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.980" end="00:44:48.420" style="s2">make merry leave us so he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.660" end="00:44:50.970" style="s2">about the disciples and Mary Magdalene</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.420" end="00:44:52.980" style="s2">is in amongst the disciples and so Simon</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.970" end="00:44:55.530" style="s2">Peter says to all the disciples make</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.980" end="00:45:00.150" style="s2">merry leave us for females do not</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.530" end="00:45:02.970" style="s2">deserve everlasting life jesus said look</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.150" end="00:45:04.980" style="s2">I will guide her to make her male so</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.970" end="00:45:07.770" style="s2">that she too may become a living spirit</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.980" end="00:45:09.570" style="s2">resembling you males for every female</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.770" end="00:45:11.700" style="s2">who makes herself male will enter the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.570" end="00:45:13.050" style="s2">kingdom of heaven so the question is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.700" end="00:45:16.290" style="s2">what exactly does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.050" end="00:45:18.840" style="s2">well I would say you know you can think</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.290" end="00:45:20.310" style="s2">about it what do you think&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.840" end="00:45:23.640" style="s2">since women discovered the birth control</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.310" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">pill you know it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.640" end="00:45:28.920" style="s2">fundamentally that what&#39;s happened is</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:30.750" style="s2">that women have taken on the attributes</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.920" end="00:45:32.820" style="s2">of masculinity that&#39;s what they want</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.750" end="00:45:36.390" style="s2">because that&#39;s associated with freedom</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.820" end="00:45:39.000" style="s2">and exploration and and and the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.390" end="00:45:41.160" style="s2">creativity that&#39;s associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.000" end="00:45:43.260" style="s2">mind rather than I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.160" end="00:45:45.869" style="s2">mere biological creativity because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.260" end="00:45:49.350" style="s2">not mere it&#39;s important but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.869" end="00:45:51.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not of the essence of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.350" end="00:45:55.230" style="s2">they say or it&#39;s not of the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.090" end="00:45:56.820" style="s2">spirit and so I don&#39;t think that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.230" end="00:45:58.950" style="s2">birth control pill could have even come</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.820" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">about as a possibility if there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.950" end="00:46:04.580" style="s2">the lingering idea in Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:06.990" style="s2">that attributing to women the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.580" end="00:46:09.060" style="s2">spiritual phenomenology that are</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.990" end="00:46:11.460" style="s2">abilities that characterized men wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.060" end="00:46:15.300" style="s2">the possibility right because you might</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.460" end="00:46:17.760" style="s2">say women were emancipated because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.300" end="00:46:19.350" style="s2">the pill but then you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.760" end="00:46:21.270" style="s2">what were the preconditions that would</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.350" end="00:46:24.390" style="s2">allow a society to do something as</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.270" end="00:46:26.520" style="s2">radical as to invent the pill now</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.390" end="00:46:28.470" style="s2">obviously one of the preconditions was</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.520" end="00:46:30.510" style="s2">that there was enough of an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.470" end="00:46:33.510" style="s2">implicit agreement among the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.510" end="00:46:35.340" style="s2">community that the idea of allowing</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.510" end="00:46:37.380" style="s2">women voluntary control over their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.340" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">reproductive status wasn&#39;t the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.380" end="00:46:43.200" style="s2">heresy that should have been punished by</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:44.580" style="s2">like instant death and even even even</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.200" end="00:46:47.240" style="s2">though that idea was there there was</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.580" end="00:46:50.190" style="s2">still a huge battle and still is between</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.240" end="00:46:52.200" style="s2">Catholicism roughly speaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.190" end="00:46:53.850" style="s2">Western world and the idea of birth</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.200" end="00:46:55.410" style="s2">control because it&#39;s still part of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.850" end="00:46:57.210" style="s2">Catholic dogma that if you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.410" end="00:46:58.080" style="s2">Catholic you don&#39;t do that and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.210" end="00:47:01.580" style="s2">know if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.080" end="00:47:03.840" style="s2">oh this or not but you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.580" end="00:47:06.570" style="s2">generally women women have a menstrual</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.840" end="00:47:08.820" style="s2">period about once every 28 days well you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.570" end="00:47:10.860" style="s2">know that&#39;s built in that was built into</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.820" end="00:47:12.270" style="s2">almost all formulations of the birth</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.860" end="00:47:14.820" style="s2">control pill even though it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.270" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">necessary so the guy who invented the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.820" end="00:47:19.170" style="s2">pill decided that it would be three</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:21.000" style="s2">weeks on and one week off so that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.170" end="00:47:22.170" style="s2">menstrual cycle would stay intact so</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.000" end="00:47:24.540" style="s2">that it wouldn&#39;t look as much like a</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.540" end="00:47:29.100" style="s2">those people who are opposed to birth</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.640" end="00:47:30.450" style="s2">control when the simple matter is is you</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.100" end="00:47:32.010" style="s2">can take birth control all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.450" end="00:47:33.990" style="s2">never have a menstrual period and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.010" end="00:47:35.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t a problem or it&#39;s you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.990" end="00:47:37.050" style="s2">it has to happen now and then but it</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.610" end="00:47:41.820" style="s2">certainly doesn&#39;t happen have to happen</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.050" end="00:47:44.730" style="s2">on a weekly basis so Jung believed in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.820" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">the 1950s he there&#39;s this phenomena that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.730" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">occurred in Catholicism again which I</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:50.610" style="s2">don&#39;t understand very well but part of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:53.070" style="s2">the idea that was that there was a shift</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.610" end="00:47:55.410" style="s2">in Catholic dogma in the mid 50&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.070" end="00:47:58.230" style="s2">because there was a tremendous movement</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.410" end="00:48:00.930" style="s2">in the Catholic world to to to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.230" end="00:48:03.480" style="s2">appreciate Mary as a deity roughly</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.930" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">speaking along with Christ and and God</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.480" end="00:48:08.730" style="s2">and the Holy Ghost so it was as if Mary</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:12.060" style="s2">was being added as the fourth part of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.730" end="00:48:15.300" style="s2">the Trinity and it wasn&#39;t a movement it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.060" end="00:48:17.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t an idea that the aristocracy of</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.300" end="00:48:19.410" style="s2">the church imposed on the masses it was</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.460" end="00:48:22.500" style="s2">exactly the other way around the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.410" end="00:48:24.660" style="s2">that Mary was to be uplifted into heaven</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.500" end="00:48:26.850" style="s2">roughly speaking so she would be beside</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:28.560" style="s2">God in Christ was an idea that was</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.850" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">really popular in the Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.560" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">countries and also in Central and South</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:35.280" style="s2">America where where Mary worship is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:37.080" style="s2">huge element of Christianity and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.280" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">happened was because of that popular</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.080" end="00:48:42.540" style="s2">pressure the Catholic aristocracy</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.260" end="00:48:44.280" style="s2">announced Mary&#39;s and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.540" end="00:48:46.500" style="s2">haven&#39;t got the terminology exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.280" end="00:48:51.330" style="s2">right her ascension into heaven in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.500" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">mid 1950s and you believe that that idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.330" end="00:48:55.070" style="s2">was movement in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:59.100" style="s2">unconscious and the movement was that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.070" end="00:49:00.990" style="s2">the imagination of the Western world had</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.100" end="00:49:03.510" style="s2">progressed to the point where it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.990" end="00:49:05.190" style="s2">self-evident that there was that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.510" end="00:49:07.470" style="s2">feminine element of being was</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.190" end="00:49:09.060" style="s2">underrepresented in the idea of deity</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.470" end="00:49:11.820" style="s2">and that it needed to be elaborated up</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.060" end="00:49:14.030" style="s2">with all of the other mostly masculine</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.820" end="00:49:16.620" style="s2">and then he would have read that as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.030" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">precursor to the possibility that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.620" end="00:49:21.540" style="s2">pill could have even become a an idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:23.040" style="s2">like the underlying imagination had to</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.540" end="00:49:25.230" style="s2">be arranged to allow that to be a</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.040" end="00:49:27.450" style="s2">possibility before any of that research</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.230" end="00:49:30.720" style="s2">could have even been conducted much less</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.450" end="00:49:33.570" style="s2">the product be sold you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.720" end="00:49:35.670" style="s2">have to you got to think how bloody much</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.570" end="00:49:39.360" style="s2">preparation does it take for a culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.670" end="00:49:42.930" style="s2">to allow a birth control device to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.360" end="00:49:44.730" style="s2">sold for general use it&#39;s not like that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.930" end="00:49:48.770" style="s2">happens just because it&#39;s invented I</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.730" end="00:49:51.390" style="s2">mean forget that you know it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.770" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">people have by no means yet come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.390" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">terms with that so I&#39;ll tell you the</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">last the next part of this story and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:12.540" style="s2">then we&#39;ll stop until next week so and</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.160" end="00:50:14.460" style="s2">the Lord God took the man and put him</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.540" end="00:50:16.650" style="s2">into the Garden of Eden to dress it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.460" end="00:50:19.080" style="s2">keep it okay so that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.650" end="00:50:21.210" style="s2">idea I think because so what it&#39;s now</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.080" end="00:50:23.400" style="s2">now what the story is proposing is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.210" end="00:50:26.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a universal habitation for</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.400" end="00:50:29.340" style="s2">mankind and the universal habitation is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.010" end="00:50:33.090" style="s2">the idea of the garden now Eden means</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.340" end="00:50:35.730" style="s2">well watered place and paradise means</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.090" end="00:50:38.970" style="s2">it&#39;s from Paradiso means a walled</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.730" end="00:50:41.280" style="s2">enclosure so that the original garden is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.970" end="00:50:43.170" style="s2">a walled enclosure that&#39;s well watered</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:46.050" style="s2">then you think well what exactly is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.170" end="00:50:47.790" style="s2">garden and it seems to me that a garden</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.050" end="00:50:50.340" style="s2">is a productive union of nature and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.790" end="00:50:52.800" style="s2">culture so it&#39;s another order and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.340" end="00:50:55.860" style="s2">union right so a perfect garden is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.800" end="00:50:58.260" style="s2">beautiful because it&#39;s natural but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.860" end="00:51:00.420" style="s2">also beautiful because it&#39;s attended to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.260" end="00:51:02.190" style="s2">and paid attention to and a garden is</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.420" end="00:51:04.560" style="s2">also something that&#39;s productive right</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.190" end="00:51:06.930" style="s2">it&#39;s not just chaotic wilderness it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.560" end="00:51:08.700" style="s2">place where you can live so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.930" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">that human beings have to live inside</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.700" end="00:51:14.460" style="s2">walled gardens and so there&#39;s a physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.710" style="s2">element to that which is just true and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.460" end="00:51:19.860" style="s2">then there&#39;s a metaphysical element to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.710" end="00:51:22.080" style="s2">it which is that the the environment of</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.860" end="00:51:25.650" style="s2">a human being is the proper admixture of</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.080" end="00:51:28.470" style="s2">chaos and order and it has to be bounded</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.650" end="00:51:30.359" style="s2">so and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.470" end="00:51:32.249" style="s2">interesting corollary to that which i</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.359" end="00:51:34.670" style="s2">think is tremendously interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.249" end="00:51:38.130" style="s2">that there&#39;s a snake in the garden and</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:39.660" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting thing because part</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.130" end="00:51:42.329" style="s2">of that is the recognition that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.660" end="00:51:44.369" style="s2">can&#39;t have a place of bounded chaos in</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.329" end="00:51:46.920" style="s2">order that&#39;s productive without having</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.369" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">something in it that&#39;s it&#39;s disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.920" end="00:51:51.779" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of getting the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:54.359" style="s2">disruptiveness out and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.779" end="00:51:57.240" style="s2">imagine here&#39;s the problem and this has</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.359" end="00:51:59.009" style="s2">been discussed intensely in Christian</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.240" end="00:52:00.749" style="s2">theology because there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.009" end="00:52:03.900" style="s2">between the snake and Satan which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.749" end="00:52:05.789" style="s2">something we&#39;ll talk about later but if</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.900" end="00:52:07.950" style="s2">you if you&#39;re surrounded by infinite</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.789" end="00:52:10.980" style="s2">potential in some sense and that&#39;s chaos</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.950" end="00:52:13.380" style="s2">and you try to wall off part of it you</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.980" end="00:52:16.049" style="s2">can&#39;t keep the chaos out you can only</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.380" end="00:52:17.759" style="s2">keep it out partially in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.049" end="00:52:20.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s gonna come sneaking back in</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.759" end="00:52:22.470" style="s2">because you can&#39;t erect a wall that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.190" end="00:52:26.700" style="s2">going to keep out all the potential from</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.470" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">a designated safe place and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.700" end="00:52:30.569" style="s2">have to live in a garden you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:32.130" style="s2">encounter snakes and there&#39;s and not</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.569" end="00:52:34.700" style="s2">even God Himself can keep the damn</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.130" end="00:52:37.470" style="s2">snakes out of the garden because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.700" end="00:52:39.690" style="s2">inevitable consequence of walling off a</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.470" end="00:52:43.049" style="s2">small section from the from the from the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.690" end="00:52:50.369" style="s2">Hall so let me see if I can give you an</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.049" end="00:52:52.859" style="s2">example well I can think of a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.369" end="00:52:54.420" style="s2">metaphysical example which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.859" end="00:52:56.460" style="s2">you&#39;re going to inhabit one of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.420" end="00:52:58.559" style="s2">conceptual structures an attempt to keep</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.460" end="00:53:01.589" style="s2">that matched with the world that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.559" end="00:53:03.089" style="s2">a walled space you&#39;re saying these are</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.589" end="00:53:05.609" style="s2">the relevant things this is the place</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.089" end="00:53:08.730" style="s2">that I can inhabit but the fact of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.609" end="00:53:11.160" style="s2">matter is is that as you&#39;re walling off</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.730" end="00:53:13.910" style="s2">that little enclosure for you to inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.160" end="00:53:16.230" style="s2">there&#39;s dynamism all around you and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.910" end="00:53:17.910" style="s2">dynamism is going to affect the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">structure of this limited place that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.910" end="00:53:21.329" style="s2">you&#39;re attempting to inhabit and at some</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:23.849" style="s2">point it&#39;s going to poke its head</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.329" end="00:53:25.890" style="s2">through you just can&#39;t seal something</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.849" end="00:53:27.960" style="s2">off from everything the thing is going</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.890" end="00:53:29.640" style="s2">to come back in now one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.960" end="00:53:33.180" style="s2">that happens in the Genesis story is</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.640" end="00:53:36.180" style="s2">that the snake is actually something to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.180" end="00:53:37.650" style="s2">which Adam and Eve cannot not attend</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.180" end="00:53:39.099" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.650" end="00:53:40.660" style="s2">interesting so this</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.099" end="00:53:42.970" style="s2">snake pops up in what&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.660" end="00:53:45.130" style="s2">paradise and human-beings attention as</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.970" end="00:53:46.930" style="s2">he immediately drawn to it and i would</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.130" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">also say that&#39;s what human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.930" end="00:53:51.549" style="s2">like you know if we walled off something</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:54.009" style="s2">and attempted to make it perfect and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.549" end="00:53:55.989" style="s2">secure and something pops up inside</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.009" end="00:53:57.700" style="s2">that&#39;s unexpected and predatory and</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.989" end="00:54:00.099" style="s2">attractive the first thing we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.700" end="00:54:02.200" style="s2">to do is be automatically drawn to it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.099" end="00:54:03.670" style="s2">and then if we interact with it what</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.200" end="00:54:06.759" style="s2">it&#39;s going to do is to increase our</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.670" end="00:54:08.589" style="s2">consciousness and that is what happened</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.759" end="00:54:09.999" style="s2">as human beings evolved because one of</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.589" end="00:54:11.220" style="s2">the things we know is that we call</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.999" end="00:54:14.970" style="s2">evolved with snakes</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.220" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">we co-evolved with predatory snakes and</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.970" end="00:54:20.319" style="s2">lynn Isbell has demonstrated that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:22.839" style="s2">acuity of primate vision among a very</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.319" end="00:54:24.549" style="s2">large and diverse range of primates is</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.839" end="00:54:26.259" style="s2">correlated quite highly with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.549" end="00:54:30.609" style="s2">prevalence of predatory snakes in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.259" end="00:54:32.589" style="s2">environment and so the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.609" end="00:54:35.200" style="s2">Genesis story draws this tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.589" end="00:54:37.720" style="s2">complicated analogy and one analogy is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.200" end="00:54:39.970" style="s2">snakes give people vision and the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.720" end="00:54:41.829" style="s2">analogy is the snake is actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.970" end="00:54:44.380" style="s2">representative of the chaos that</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.829" end="00:54:47.140" style="s2">surrounds every bounded order and so it</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.380" end="00:54:48.809" style="s2">tells the story of psychological</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.140" end="00:54:51.700" style="s2">abstraction so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.809" end="00:54:54.910" style="s2">consciousness versus the unknown and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.700" end="00:54:57.849" style="s2">overlays that on primate snake and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.910" end="00:55:00.759" style="s2">because it&#39;s the same it&#39;s the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.849" end="00:55:02.650" style="s2">at two levels of abstraction so you have</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.759" end="00:55:05.229" style="s2">the same reaction to unexpected things</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.650" end="00:55:07.630" style="s2">that occur in your pristine environment</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.229" end="00:55:09.249" style="s2">as your distant ancestors would have had</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.630" end="00:55:11.289" style="s2">to the appearance of a snake in a place</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.249" end="00:55:13.690" style="s2">that they regarded as secure and used</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.289" end="00:55:16.210" style="s2">the same dam circuits it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.690" end="00:55:18.579" style="s2">thing and one of the major claims in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.210" end="00:55:21.729" style="s2">story of Genesis is no gardens without</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.579" end="00:55:23.410" style="s2">snakes and so it you know the story is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.729" end="00:55:26.140" style="s2">set up so that God tells us men and</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.410" end="00:55:27.549" style="s2">women to ignore the damn snake and not</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.140" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">to pay any attention with it not to</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.549" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">interact with it and also not to eat the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">fruit of the tree of the knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:34.869" style="s2">good and evil which we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:37.329" style="s2">later but human beings don&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.869" end="00:55:40.239" style="s2">they they interact with the snake and</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.329" end="00:55:42.039" style="s2">they become self conscious which is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.239" end="00:55:44.440" style="s2">catastrophe and that&#39;s how it&#39;s shown in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.039" end="00:55:46.380" style="s2">the in the story as well so as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.440" end="00:55:49.630" style="s2">human beings become self conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.380" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">get thrown out of paradise so you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.630" end="00:55:54.420" style="s2">read it this way</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:56.040" style="s2">we got so smart by paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.420" end="00:55:59.640" style="s2">the damn snakes that we figured out we</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.040" end="00:56:01.410" style="s2">were mortal they drove cortical</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.640" end="00:56:03.060" style="s2">evolution especially the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.410" end="00:56:04.560" style="s2">the visual system now I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.060" end="00:56:06.570" style="s2">reduce it to a unit dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.560" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">phenomena but the point is once you get</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.570" end="00:56:10.500" style="s2">cortically elaborated enough at some</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:14.070" style="s2">point you&#39;re going to discover time</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.500" end="00:56:15.660" style="s2">which we have discovered and once you</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.070" end="00:56:17.490" style="s2">discover time you&#39;re going to discover</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.660" end="00:56:19.230" style="s2">one of your boundaries and one of your</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.490" end="00:56:21.240" style="s2">boundaries is temporal boundary and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.230" end="00:56:22.740" style="s2">means that you die and that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.240" end="00:56:24.780" style="s2">like the ultimate manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.740" end="00:56:26.550" style="s2">self-consciousness and then as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.780" end="00:56:28.110" style="s2">you know that you&#39;re going to die while</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.550" end="00:56:28.890" style="s2">you&#39;re not in paradise anymore that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.110" end="00:56:30.900" style="s2">for sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.890" end="00:56:33.000" style="s2">and then you have to start taking you</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.900" end="00:56:35.670" style="s2">have to start preparing for the future</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.000" end="00:56:37.170" style="s2">in a self-conscious manner and one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.670" end="00:56:38.970" style="s2">the things that happens to Adam what</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.170" end="00:56:40.470" style="s2">once God catches a master he&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.970" end="00:56:41.940" style="s2">self conscious this God says to him</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.470" end="00:56:44.970" style="s2">straightforwardly well now you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.940" end="00:56:46.230" style="s2">it you know you&#39;ve become self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.970" end="00:56:47.730" style="s2">and now we&#39;ll all your going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.230" end="00:56:50.250" style="s2">to do for the rest of history is work</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.730" end="00:56:52.860" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be condemned to work and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.250" end="00:56:56.010" style="s2">you might say well what&#39;s the definition</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.860" end="00:56:57.840" style="s2">of work and that&#39;s easy it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.010" end="00:57:00.330" style="s2">sacrifice of the present for the future</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.840" end="00:57:01.980" style="s2">and you won&#39;t do that unless you&#39;re self</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.330" end="00:57:04.350" style="s2">conscious because why the hell would you</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.980" end="00:57:06.690" style="s2">prepare for the future unless you knew</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.350" end="00:57:09.720" style="s2">that it might consist of nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.690" end="00:57:11.640" style="s2">trouble and you know Genesis portrays</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.720" end="00:57:14.190" style="s2">that discovery as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.640" end="00:57:16.650" style="s2">absolutely fundamental to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.190" end="00:57:18.990" style="s2">ground of human existence it&#39;s only part</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.650" end="00:57:21.930" style="s2">of what it portrays and so we&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.990" end="00:57:24.150" style="s2">about some of the other details when we</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.930" end="00:57:26.119" style="s2">get together next week now what I want</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.150" end="00:57:29.070" style="s2">to do is I want to tell you this story I</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.119" end="00:57:30.900" style="s2">want to show you how it relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.070" end="00:57:33.119" style="s2">emergence of self-consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.900" end="00:57:35.700" style="s2">that&#39;s the collapse of paradox and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.119" end="00:57:37.890" style="s2">it&#39;s the same idea as the descent into</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.700" end="00:57:39.390" style="s2">the underworld so the Bible in some</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.890" end="00:57:42.060" style="s2">sense is a descent into the underworld</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.390" end="00:57:44.720" style="s2">and then a sentient story it&#39;s precisely</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.060" end="00:57:47.340" style="s2">that because it&#39;s a redemptive story</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.720" end="00:57:50.580" style="s2">history starts when people descend into</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.340" end="00:57:53.490" style="s2">chaos and the entire historical element</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.580" end="00:57:55.800" style="s2">of the Bible is part of the attempt of</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.490" end="00:57:57.720" style="s2">human beings to lift themselves out of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.800" end="00:58:00.240" style="s2">the painful self-consciousness that</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.720" end="00:58:02.450" style="s2">they&#39;ve fallen into as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.240" end="00:58:05.450" style="s2">interacting with the snake and the fruit</p>
