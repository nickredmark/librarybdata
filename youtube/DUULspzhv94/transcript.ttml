<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:05.920" style="s2">so yesterday i sat through a friend&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.679" end="00:00:07.600" style="s2">doterra essential oil pitch and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.920" end="00:00:08.240" style="s2">gonna be sending her an own message by</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.600" end="00:00:10.000" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.240" end="00:00:11.840" style="s2">but i want to talk about the financial</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.000" end="00:00:13.360" style="s2">compensation plan of doterra</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.840" end="00:00:14.960" style="s2">of which i watched a youtube video i</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.360" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">will link in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.960" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">so this woman&#39;s talking about of course</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:19.760" style="s2">how you can build your business and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:20.320" style="s2">so easy and it&#39;s just about the power of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.760" end="00:00:21.760" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:23.119" style="s2">i will also link to the timestamp she</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.760" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">goes over the first three kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.119" end="00:00:25.279" style="s2">compensation which have problems in and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.279" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">but this is the big one this is why</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:32.800" style="s2">people get involved in it so</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">all you have to do is recruit</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.800" end="00:00:40.160" style="s2">three friends who recruit</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">three friends who recruit three friends</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.160" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">right down the line so this line the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.200" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">three</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">you get two percent of everything they</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">sell they sell</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.680" end="00:00:51.920" style="s2">the next line down you get three percent</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.920" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">and then five percent and then five</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:59.120" style="s2">and then six percent and then six</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.120" end="00:01:05.280" style="s2">and then seven percent</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">this is already broken because this</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.280" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">means everything that is sold</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">has a 34 commission on it 34</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:15.360" style="s2">that isn&#39;t going into making the product</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:16.159" style="s2">better it isn&#39;t going the way they can</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.360" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">afford this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.159" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">all of this free labor so</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.040" style="s2">34 is what you have to sell your</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:24.400" style="s2">customers you&#39;re not selling a product</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.040" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">you&#39;re selling a business</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">so they have to be convinced that they</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">can also make this some mlms have this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">flipped</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">so that you have the biggest amount up</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">here they are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:36.079" style="s2">better mlms still predatory still a</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.079" end="00:01:40.159" style="s2">but they can&#39;t convince you of what she</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:42.560" style="s2">says next with this compensation plan</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.159" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">everybody&#39;s spending their 150 pv</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.560" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">basically 150</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:50.479" style="s2">a month on product</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">you get 32 000</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.479" end="00:01:59.680" style="s2">per month but what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">this line here is 2 1887 people</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.680" end="00:02:02.560" style="s2">you have to convince three people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">convince three people to convince three</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.560" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:06.960" style="s2">you have to dupe three people to duke</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:10.160" style="s2">three people to duke three people</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.960" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">so that the total all seven lines down</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.160" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">is thirty two hundred and eighty people</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">involved selling a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">dollars a month of essential oils to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">or loved ones that they&#39;re gonna dupe</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">into this because nobody needs 150</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">of essential oils a month month after</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">month that is how you get the 32 000</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:28.959" style="s2">which means the vast majority of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:32.599" style="s2">income if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.959" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">could do this comes from this line</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.599" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">2187 people spending 150</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">a month and you get seven percent of</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">that that number is 23 000</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.239" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">so most of that money comes from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:49.040" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.000" style="s2">even if it&#39;s reversed the math is broken</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.040" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">but these people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.000" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">the 3 280 people can&#39;t also build</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:58.560" style="s2">3 280 people and even if they can</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">because you&#39;re not out of you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.560" end="00:03:03.280" style="s2">you&#39;re still actually kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">realm of possibility at that point but</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.280" end="00:03:06.400" style="s2">even if they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.560" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">you definitely can&#39;t get more than two</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:12.640" style="s2">these thirty two hundred and eighty</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.040" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">people becoming the first person and</p>
