<p begin="00:00:19.750" end="00:00:24.310" style="s2">join together an unlikely group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.820" end="00:00:26.560" style="s2">intellectuals and alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.310" end="00:00:28.869" style="s2">personalities all the way from</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.790" end="00:00:39.220" style="s2">political spectrum but all supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.220" end="00:00:42.340" style="s2">united by their willingness to have open</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.220" end="00:00:45.340" style="s2">and difficult conversations the name</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.340" end="00:00:46.510" style="s2">stuck interest in the phenomenon quickly</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.340" end="00:00:48.610" style="s2">spread far and wide</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.510" end="00:00:52.740" style="s2">with many thousands joining the</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.610" end="00:00:56.560" style="s2">conversation online welcomed by some</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.740" end="00:00:59.350" style="s2">ridiculed by others and even questioned</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.560" end="00:01:03.940" style="s2">by some in the group it&#39;s like a herd of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.350" end="00:01:07.450" style="s2">cats right because so I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.940" end="00:01:08.920" style="s2">well what what what unites us to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.450" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">degree that there&#39;s an us because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.920" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">not so self-evident there&#39;s enough of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.409" end="00:01:17.499" style="s2">us so that the name emerged and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:19.509" style="s2">stuck so so there&#39;s something in common</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.499" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">because otherwise the name wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.509" end="00:01:24.939" style="s2">stuck right you can&#39;t name nothing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:28.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work so what is the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.939" end="00:01:31.990" style="s2">dark web people in the group tend to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.090" end="00:01:34.869" style="s2">reject orthodoxy tend to reject ideology</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.990" end="00:01:38.380" style="s2">tend to be interested in first</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.869" end="00:01:41.979" style="s2">principles thinking meaning that if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.380" end="00:01:45.369" style="s2">you don&#39;t take something on faith it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.979" end="00:01:47.829" style="s2">very smart concept to try to corral a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.369" end="00:01:53.740" style="s2">very difficult group of very disparate</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.829" end="00:01:55.689" style="s2">people into one orbit I think everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.740" end="00:01:58.689" style="s2">who&#39;s being described as a member that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.689" end="00:02:00.340" style="s2">the IDW probably has among other things</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.689" end="00:02:03.880" style="s2">one thing in common which is they all</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.340" end="00:02:06.520" style="s2">are used to being held at for saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.880" end="00:02:08.890" style="s2">things that are self-evident how old</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.520" end="00:02:10.270" style="s2">that in public only to then discover</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.890" end="00:02:12.040" style="s2">that the public come up to them in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.270" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">private and say thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.040" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:17.790" style="s2">I would say it is actually the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.170" end="00:02:19.800" style="s2">manifestation of the process of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.790" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">that&#39;s more important than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.800" end="00:02:23.310" style="s2">conclusions that are generated you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:24.959" style="s2">a group of people who are willing to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.310" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">hey you know you made a better point I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.959" end="00:02:29.209" style="s2">changed my mind and I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">something that I didn&#39;t think about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.209" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">that kind of integrity in a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">is what characterizes a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:41.370" style="s2">internal IDW discussion to me it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:43.319" style="s2">people agree not on their positions they</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.370" end="00:02:45.269" style="s2">may not even agree as to what the facts</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.319" end="00:02:47.459" style="s2">are but they usually agree as to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.269" end="00:02:49.290" style="s2">constitutes conversation the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.459" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">intellectual darkweb seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.290" end="00:02:55.440" style="s2">something Eric Weinstein came up with on</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:58.230" style="s2">the spur of the moment but it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:01.890" style="s2">had been years in the making part of me</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.230" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">wants to work quietly and part of me</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.890" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">realizes that we have to work in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">public facing capacity and I personally</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:15.470" style="s2">have found it much more comfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:18.690" style="s2">have a private life to not have</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.470" end="00:03:20.940" style="s2">everything that I&#39;m thinking broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.690" end="00:03:24.180" style="s2">to a large audience but I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.940" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">run out of time and so I think some of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.180" end="00:03:30.150" style="s2">us are somewhat reluctantly choosing to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">make a different call now I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.150" end="00:03:36.019" style="s2">with the current administration and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:38.100" style="s2">White House you&#39;re seeing a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.019" end="00:03:39.570" style="s2">discontinuity with the past and it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.100" end="00:03:41.940" style="s2">wasn&#39;t the discontinuity that I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.570" end="00:03:44.070" style="s2">hoping for we had to break with the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.940" end="00:03:45.660" style="s2">and I think that the way in which we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.070" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">now breaking with the past is so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">destructive nobody knows what to believe</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.420" end="00:03:53.730" style="s2">nobody quite knows what&#39;s true nobody</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:55.950" style="s2">knows where to turn this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.730" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">tenable situation and so either we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.950" end="00:04:00.780" style="s2">going to descend into some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:02.850" style="s2">permanent chaos or there is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.780" end="00:04:05.220" style="s2">have to be something that we reboot from</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.850" end="00:04:07.410" style="s2">and that thing cannot be simply left or</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.220" end="00:04:11.130" style="s2">simply right and that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.410" end="00:04:14.310" style="s2">reasons the IDW is hopeful to me this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.130" end="00:04:16.579" style="s2">the origin story of the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.310" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.579" end="00:04:22.919" style="s2">what started off this path that I find</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:25.500" style="s2">myself on is that I was curious about</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.919" end="00:04:27.410" style="s2">certain things curious about the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.500" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">and I wanted to ask a bunch of questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.410" end="00:04:32.940" style="s2">about well really pretty much everything</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:36.509" style="s2">and I find that if you keep asking why</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:38.430" style="s2">questions you eventually either a get</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.509" end="00:04:42.690" style="s2">tired or B become a theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.430" end="00:04:45.570" style="s2">physicist or mathematician and so many</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.690" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">of the deepest questions led to a kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.570" end="00:04:52.050" style="s2">of disciplined way of thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">world where we see all of the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.050" end="00:04:58.070" style="s2">in the world around us as being built up</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:05:01.949" style="s2">from very simple and beautiful patterns</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.070" end="00:05:05.610" style="s2">and I think was my desire to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.949" end="00:05:09.000" style="s2">to that story in particular with</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.610" end="00:05:12.690" style="s2">theoretical physics that began my path</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.000" end="00:05:15.539" style="s2">but at the time that I really emerged as</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.690" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">an adult theoretical physics was in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.539" end="00:05:22.110" style="s2">great deal of difficulty in trouble and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.740" end="00:05:24.900" style="s2">I think as I came to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.110" end="00:05:26.789" style="s2">there was a big story that was going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.900" end="00:05:28.229" style="s2">affect everything that I cared about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.789" end="00:05:30.659" style="s2">was gonna affect the markets it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.229" end="00:05:32.789" style="s2">gonna affect our families our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.659" end="00:05:35.789" style="s2">ourselves our security and that story is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.789" end="00:05:38.610" style="s2">the story of what happens when humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.789" end="00:05:41.250" style="s2">get addicted to high levels of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.610" end="00:05:43.800" style="s2">distributed stable technology let growth</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.250" end="00:05:46.020" style="s2">and then are denied the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.800" end="00:05:48.389" style="s2">continue on that path that means that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.020" end="00:05:54.060" style="s2">you&#39;re set up potentially for war for</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.389" end="00:05:56.310" style="s2">civil unrest for communism if people try</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.060" end="00:05:58.710" style="s2">to grab what their neighbor has or</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.310" end="00:06:01.080" style="s2">fascism if people try to maintain order</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.710" end="00:06:03.539" style="s2">at all costs I define this thing called</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.080" end="00:06:05.699" style="s2">an ego or an increment embedded growth</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.539" end="00:06:08.250" style="s2">obligation and an embedded growth</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.699" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">obligation is how fast the structure has</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.250" end="00:06:15.060" style="s2">to grow in order to maintain its honest</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">positions so if you have a situation in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.060" end="00:06:22.950" style="s2">which you have trial lawyers and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.620" end="00:06:24.570" style="s2">supported by various associates and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.950" end="00:06:27.470" style="s2">associates all want to become partners</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.570" end="00:06:29.570" style="s2">and trial lawyers themselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.470" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">what you have is you have a situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.570" end="00:06:34.310" style="s2">where the law firm has to grow at a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:37.220" style="s2">fast clip if all those people are going</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.310" end="00:06:40.130" style="s2">to be satisfied with their job decisions</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.220" end="00:06:42.440" style="s2">well very quickly that ability to grow</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.130" end="00:06:44.330" style="s2">runs out and then people want to know</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.440" end="00:06:44.810" style="s2">why am i stuck in a position going</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.330" end="00:06:46.040" style="s2">nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.810" end="00:06:47.570" style="s2">well the same thing was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.040" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">theoretical physics examining in</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.570" end="00:06:51.290" style="s2">mathematics it was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">pension funds it was happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.290" end="00:06:56.150" style="s2">absolutely everywhere except for a small</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:58.460" style="s2">number of places like startups and hedge</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.150" end="00:07:01.850" style="s2">funds which were a period of time were</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.460" end="00:07:03.920" style="s2">able to buck that trend and as I came to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.850" end="00:07:08.810" style="s2">understand that we were in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.920" end="00:07:14.030" style="s2">society-wide Ponzi scheme since the late</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:30.220" style="s2">sounds like a very counterintuitive or a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.180" end="00:09:36.660" style="s2">very odd thing to be declaring war on</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.220" end="00:09:38.889" style="s2">well yeah so it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.660" end="00:09:40.420" style="s2">excellence in and of itself isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.889" end="00:09:43.509" style="s2">problem the problem is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.420" end="00:09:50.019" style="s2">realize that excellence is a modality</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.509" end="00:09:53.889" style="s2">that is expensive when we pursue</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.149" end="00:10:12.550" style="s2">well those low variance behaviors are at</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.579" end="00:10:15.189" style="s2">the cost of high variance behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.550" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">most of what I think actually ends up</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.189" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">moving the dial in human history is high</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:25.660" style="s2">variance human activity so what is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">that allows somebody who&#39;s as unreliable</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.660" end="00:10:34.110" style="s2">as Jim Watson of double-helix fame to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:36.430" style="s2">repeatedly deliver outstanding</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.110" end="00:10:39.490" style="s2">discoveries so you you have a guy who</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.490" end="00:10:47.220" style="s2">other hand a giant chunk of modern</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.170" end="00:10:51.209" style="s2">molecular biology is due to him and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.220" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">biology so you have very high variance</p>

<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:58.980" style="s2">difficult they&#39;re unpleasant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.589" end="00:11:00.899" style="s2">time-consuming but they&#39;re able to play</p>

<p begin="00:11:00.899" end="00:11:08.279" style="s2">and bring us unbelievable wonders so a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.819" end="00:11:12.149" style="s2">famous example for me is Bill Shockley</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.279" end="00:11:15.449" style="s2">who was a eugenicist kind of a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.149" end="00:11:18.540" style="s2">nutcase with respect to certain ideas</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.449" end="00:11:20.430" style="s2">too many on the other hand you know he</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.540" end="00:11:22.379" style="s2">was one of the prime reasons that we got</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.430" end="00:11:24.600" style="s2">the semiconductor and built an industry</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.379" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">around it and if you think about all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.600" end="00:11:28.769" style="s2">the things that are done with</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:31.230" style="s2">transistors you know a lot of them go</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.769" end="00:11:34.649" style="s2">back to Bill Shockley okay well are we</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.230" end="00:11:37.800" style="s2">willing to give up our semiconductors in</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.649" end="00:11:42.689" style="s2">order to protest Shockley&#39;s excesses in</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.800" end="00:11:44.879" style="s2">the field of eugenics I in general and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.689" end="00:11:47.040" style="s2">not I&#39;m willing to tolerate a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.879" end="00:11:49.500" style="s2">eccentricity and difficult behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.040" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">unpleasant people and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.500" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">absolutely imperative that we realize</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:57.059" style="s2">that as a society we are standing on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:12:03.720" style="s2">shoulders not only of giants but of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.059" end="00:12:05.360" style="s2">jerks of unseemly people very marginal</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.720" end="00:12:08.309" style="s2">individuals who have nevertheless</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.360" end="00:12:11.550" style="s2">contributed much of the genius that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.309" end="00:12:13.589" style="s2">undergirds our modern productive society</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.550" end="00:12:15.899" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.589" end="00:12:18.209" style="s2">that we don&#39;t even know our own history</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.899" end="00:12:21.089" style="s2">to know this uncomfortable relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.209" end="00:12:24.180" style="s2">and how important it is to allow in high</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.089" end="00:12:27.029" style="s2">variance individuals into a world which</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.180" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">now attempts to shut them out by</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.029" end="00:12:31.949" style="s2">claiming that we need excellence at all</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">costs and highly agreeable people with</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.949" end="00:12:37.949" style="s2">very small variants this is a a one-way</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.280" end="00:23:38.120" style="s2">many of us are very disturbed by our</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.890" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">ability to see incentives pushing people</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.120" end="00:23:46.400" style="s2">to hold certain conclusions so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:48.470" style="s2">think that that structure is enforced by</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.400" end="00:23:50.840" style="s2">taking anyone who&#39;s outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.470" end="00:23:53.450" style="s2">consensus and attaching concepts to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.840" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">their name so one of the experiments I</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.450" end="00:23:59.270" style="s2">tried was controversial professor Paul</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">Krugman versus controversial professor</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.270" end="00:24:05.179" style="s2">or Jordan Peterson Paul Krugman has been</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:07.580" style="s2">a controversial professor professor for</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.179" end="00:24:09.250" style="s2">decades but there wasn&#39;t a single hit on</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.580" end="00:24:12.050" style="s2">all of Google for the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.250" end="00:24:13.760" style="s2">controversial professor Paul Krugman</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.050" end="00:24:15.350" style="s2">because this is one of the tricks inside</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.760" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">of what I called the gut gated</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.350" end="00:24:20.660" style="s2">institutional narrative or the Djinn so</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.080" end="00:24:25.730" style="s2">in the Djinn the way it works is that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.660" end="00:24:29.960" style="s2">you have these set phrases could be you</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.730" end="00:24:32.900" style="s2">know controversial strong man Bashar</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.960" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">al-assad okay well what is that telling</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.900" end="00:24:37.400" style="s2">us it&#39;s the news media opining that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:39.980" style="s2">should be picking aside and that he</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.400" end="00:24:42.200" style="s2">should be on the opposite side so when</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.980" end="00:24:45.050" style="s2">you have a situation where the news</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.200" end="00:24:47.240" style="s2">media wants to promote somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.050" end="00:24:49.130" style="s2">Paul Krugman they don&#39;t call him</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.240" end="00:24:51.410" style="s2">controversial professor Paul Krugman</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.130" end="00:24:54.650" style="s2">they call him New York Times columnist</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.410" end="00:24:56.600" style="s2">or Nobel laureate Paul Krugman but if</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.650" end="00:24:58.370" style="s2">it&#39;s Jordan Peterson and Jordan hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.600" end="00:25:00.590" style="s2">signed up for some sort of consensus</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.370" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">position he has to be controversial</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.590" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">professor Jordan Peterson now it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.710" style="s2">that he&#39;s a controversial professor but</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:09.530" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the gated institutional</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.710" end="00:25:11.330" style="s2">narrative special language for telling</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.530" end="00:25:13.100" style="s2">the audience who the good guys and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.330" end="00:25:15.110" style="s2">bad guys are and if you go back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.100" end="00:25:18.169" style="s2">professional wrestling this would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.110" end="00:25:20.120" style="s2">called heels and baby faces or faces and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.169" end="00:25:22.100" style="s2">so the idea is that Paul Krugman would</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.120" end="00:25:24.770" style="s2">be a face and Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.100" end="00:25:26.660" style="s2">would be a heel but instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.770" end="00:25:32.210" style="s2">open about the fact that wrestling is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.660" end="00:25:34.309" style="s2">simulated performance sport in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.210" end="00:25:35.929" style="s2">journalistic endeavor we pretend the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.309" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">journalism is actually a search for</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.929" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">truth which I find hysterically</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.920" end="00:25:46.780" style="s2">and you&#39;ve described this as kayfabe in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:48.070" style="s2">the past right Lou</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.780" end="00:25:50.380" style="s2">can you explain what that is to people</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.070" end="00:25:51.820" style="s2">who maybe not heard that sure I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.380" end="00:25:53.860" style="s2">one of the problems is that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.820" end="00:25:56.140" style="s2">have good language for dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.860" end="00:25:57.670" style="s2">multi-layered deception and the two</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.140" end="00:25:59.020" style="s2">places that I thought had pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.670" end="00:26:02.380" style="s2">language where the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.020" end="00:26:04.630" style="s2">community and professional wrestling so</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.380" end="00:26:06.760" style="s2">a professional wrestling was the easier</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.630" end="00:26:09.160" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to get spooks to give up their</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.760" end="00:26:11.880" style="s2">secrets so what I did is I started to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.160" end="00:26:15.280" style="s2">look into professional wrestling and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.880" end="00:26:18.160" style="s2">what our order all of the terms that</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.280" end="00:26:19.960" style="s2">they have to maintain to keep track what</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.160" end="00:26:22.180" style="s2">the actual storylines are with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.960" end="00:26:25.630" style="s2">simulated storyline sometimes you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.180" end="00:26:28.300" style="s2">simulated storyline that apparently</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.630" end="00:26:29.800" style="s2">breaks into actual reality or like</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.300" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">you&#39;re breaking the fourth wall but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.800" end="00:26:35.740" style="s2">actually a controlled structure where</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:38.740" style="s2">you&#39;re still in a fake story so they</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.740" end="00:26:43.270" style="s2">call things that are fake works and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.740" end="00:26:47.320" style="s2">call things that are real shoots so a a</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.270" end="00:26:50.800" style="s2">worked shoot is actually something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.320" end="00:26:53.020" style="s2">is set inside of a fake storyline is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:55.660" style="s2">apparently real and breaks the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.020" end="00:26:57.580" style="s2">wall but is in fact fake so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.660" end="00:26:59.560" style="s2">talking about tertiary and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.580" end="00:27:01.360" style="s2">quaternary levels of deception I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.560" end="00:27:05.230" style="s2">think the human mind can do much more</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.360" end="00:27:07.630" style="s2">than four layers of lie but kayfabe is</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.230" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">the organized structure of lies that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.630" end="00:27:12.700" style="s2">undergirds professional wrestling and is</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:16.930" style="s2">kept it as a simulated sport for about a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.700" end="00:27:20.110" style="s2">century all sorts of human activity vir</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.930" end="00:27:22.000" style="s2">between utter terror and boredom and why</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.110" end="00:27:24.700" style="s2">is that well because if something is</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.000" end="00:27:27.730" style="s2">actually an unbounded negative potential</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.700" end="00:27:29.910" style="s2">experience people are very hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.730" end="00:27:32.380" style="s2">engage so if two wrestlers</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.910" end="00:27:33.970" style="s2">can really do damage to each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.380" end="00:27:37.150" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna circle each other for a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.970" end="00:27:39.040" style="s2">very long time before engaging because</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.150" end="00:27:40.810" style="s2">they don&#39;t want to risk anything that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.040" end="00:27:42.370" style="s2">they don&#39;t have to so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.810" end="00:27:44.970" style="s2">bouts that would go on for four or five</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.370" end="00:27:47.650" style="s2">hours and basically nothing happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.970" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">well this is true in all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.650" end="00:27:51.970" style="s2">endeavors people in the know and finance</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.230" style="s2">don&#39;t really want to risk their money</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.970" end="00:27:54.879" style="s2">so they come up with all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.230" end="00:27:56.940" style="s2">elaborate ways to make sure that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.879" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2">going to be okay no matter what happens</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.940" end="00:28:02.500" style="s2">in politics the same is true nobody</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.860" end="00:28:03.340" style="s2">wants to simply find that they&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.500" end="00:28:05.500" style="s2">a job</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.340" end="00:28:10.230" style="s2">because they lost an election so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.500" end="00:28:12.879" style="s2">an elaborate revolving door between</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.870" end="00:29:21.940" style="s2">very similar to what I see happening in</p>

<p begin="00:30:08.150" end="00:30:12.950" style="s2">there&#39;s the New York Times article that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.400" end="00:30:14.990" style="s2">came out and kind of named the IDW is</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.950" end="00:30:17.870" style="s2">there a kind of paradox in it&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="00:30:24.470" end="00:30:32.030" style="s2">that thing is the institutional media</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.520" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">and the main platforms be they academic</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.030" end="00:30:38.420" style="s2">or governmental so if you will I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">that the mainstream media has pretended</p>

<p begin="00:30:45.110" end="00:30:50.530" style="s2">think that you know what&#39;s really going</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.820" end="00:30:54.170" style="s2">on is that there&#39;s been a monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.530" end="00:30:57.890" style="s2">effectively on narrative held by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.170" end="00:31:02.690" style="s2">collection of major institutional voices</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.690" end="00:31:07.490" style="s2">broader than people have been led to</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.050" end="00:31:10.430" style="s2">believe and I think that&#39;s where the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.490" end="00:31:12.680" style="s2">comes in that we are it&#39;s not that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:12.680" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">of the points we&#39;re making really aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:31:22.160" end="00:31:25.730" style="s2">talking about are simply commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.680" end="00:31:28.060" style="s2">observations did you have any doubts</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.730" end="00:31:32.420" style="s2">about about New York Times article I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.060" end="00:31:34.250" style="s2">mean I had I had an infinite number of</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.250" end="00:31:40.070" style="s2">part of me wants to work quietly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:45.170" style="s2">part of me realizes that we have to work</p>

<p begin="00:31:45.170" end="00:31:51.140" style="s2">personally have found it much more</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.940" end="00:31:54.370" style="s2">comfortable to have a private life to</p>

<p begin="00:31:57.290" end="00:32:01.610" style="s2">think we&#39;ve run out of time and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.200" end="00:32:05.720" style="s2">think some of us are somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.610" end="00:32:08.090" style="s2">reluctantly choosing to make a different</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.410" end="00:32:13.010" style="s2">have a different way of thinking is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.300" end="00:32:16.190" style="s2">what characterizes the members of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.010" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">IDW it&#39;s hard to say I mean I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.190" end="00:32:21.000" style="s2">that everybody in the IDW is fairly</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:24.390" style="s2">disagreeable in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.000" end="00:32:26.130" style="s2">the Big Five personality inventory so</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.390" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">can you hold a position when you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.130" end="00:32:30.270" style="s2">only person in a room that believes that</p>

<p begin="00:32:30.270" end="00:32:37.020" style="s2">people I would say almost everybody in</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.940" end="00:32:38.730" style="s2">the core of the IDW is capable of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.020" end="00:32:40.380" style="s2">holding a position where everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.730" end="00:32:41.760" style="s2">against you and I think that that trait</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.380" end="00:32:44.159" style="s2">is extremely rare</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.760" end="00:32:47.669" style="s2">do you see the IDW is primarily a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.159" end="00:32:52.110" style="s2">political project no I don&#39;t I see it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.669" end="00:32:56.760" style="s2">primarily as a precursor to anything</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.110" end="00:32:58.710" style="s2">decent it&#39;s what has to succeed for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.760" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">to have a political conversation I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.710" end="00:33:03.510" style="s2">think we&#39;re having a political</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:05.549" style="s2">conversation either internationally or</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.510" end="00:33:07.409" style="s2">nationally I think we have people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.549" end="00:33:09.179" style="s2">are talking about nonsense positions we</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.409" end="00:33:10.409" style="s2">just went back to the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.179" end="00:33:13.350" style="s2">position there are only two positions</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.409" end="00:33:14.820" style="s2">unconvinced aren&#39;t political one is open</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.350" end="00:33:16.440" style="s2">borders which is never going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.820" end="00:33:18.450" style="s2">and the other one is closed borders</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.440" end="00:33:20.730" style="s2">which is never going to happen and yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.450" end="00:33:24.600" style="s2">you very often encounter people who are</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.730" end="00:33:27.150" style="s2">talking in these terms as if these are</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.600" end="00:33:28.169" style="s2">the actual positions so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.150" end="00:33:29.549" style="s2">that we&#39;re having a political</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.169" end="00:33:31.770" style="s2">conversation I think that what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.549" end="00:33:34.860" style="s2">going on is is that the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.770" end="00:33:36.690" style="s2">has been playing keep-away ball right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.860" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">this game where you&#39;re throwing the ball</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.690" end="00:33:39.780" style="s2">over somebody who&#39;s trying to catch it</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:41.820" style="s2">now the public has been trying to get in</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.780" end="00:33:44.370" style="s2">on this conversation but what keeps</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.820" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">happening is is that our fake left and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.370" end="00:33:48.539" style="s2">our fake right are engaged in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:51.090" style="s2">completely fake conversation about fake</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.539" end="00:33:53.309" style="s2">items including fake news which they</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.090" end="00:33:55.380" style="s2">themselves are pushing out and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.309" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">claiming to fight fake news so the whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.380" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">thing is so saturated in falsehood that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:03.299" style="s2">people are waking up to the idea oh I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">forgotten what it sound sounded like for</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.299" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">people to actually have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:09.419" style="s2">about a topic and how much time it takes</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:12.750" style="s2">you know in general it can&#39;t be done</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:14.339" style="s2">with four or five voices on a panel in</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.750" end="00:34:16.349" style="s2">10 minutes with a few commercial</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.339" end="00:34:18.119" style="s2">interruptions they&#39;re just almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.349" end="00:34:19.859" style="s2">nothing can be discussed that way and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.119" end="00:34:21.599" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s worse is that the very</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.859" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">people who would be best able to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.599" end="00:34:25.500" style="s2">it are never going to be invited on to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:27.270" style="s2">those programs in a way the people in</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.500" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">the IDW have been selected for like a</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.270" end="00:34:31.759" style="s2">lot of them have had quite high-profile</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.669" end="00:34:34.229" style="s2">encounters you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.759" end="00:34:39.599" style="s2">Sam Harris with Ben Affleck or you look</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.229" end="00:34:41.759" style="s2">at Brett Weinstein and there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.599" end="00:34:43.589" style="s2">that they&#39;ve in some way had to live out</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.759" end="00:34:44.819" style="s2">their ideas there&#39;s a sense of bravery</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.589" end="00:34:45.449" style="s2">that they&#39;ve had to stick up for</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.819" end="00:34:47.279" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.449" end="00:34:49.379" style="s2">Jordan Peterson and C 16 I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.279" end="00:34:51.269" style="s2">could you can list a lot of times where</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.379" end="00:34:52.739" style="s2">as you said they had to be that one</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.269" end="00:34:54.509" style="s2">person who was thinking of certain thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.739" end="00:34:57.239" style="s2">no I mean I think I made the point</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.509" end="00:35:00.689" style="s2">probably on the Rubin report that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.239" end="00:35:03.689" style="s2">going on is that when you ask any large</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.689" end="00:35:05.519" style="s2">collection of people to salute a</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.689" end="00:35:09.089" style="s2">nonsensical flag and pledge allegiance</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.519" end="00:35:10.229" style="s2">to it and more or less everyone makes</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.089" end="00:35:12.089" style="s2">the calculation</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.229" end="00:35:14.640" style="s2">I guess if this is going to get me</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.089" end="00:35:16.680" style="s2">through my day I&#39;ll salute any flag and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.640" end="00:35:19.799" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the one gal or one guy who</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.680" end="00:35:21.719" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to well my observation is</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.799" end="00:35:24.089" style="s2">that that person is usually sitting on</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.719" end="00:35:26.609" style="s2">an entire mountain of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.089" end="00:35:28.999" style="s2">thoughts that they don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.609" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">freedom to simply make a convenience</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.999" end="00:35:35.239" style="s2">readjustment and so from that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:37.979" style="s2">perspective yeah in general if you ask a</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.769" end="00:36:59.829" style="s2">writing for movies allowed for real</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.569" end="00:37:13.930" style="s2">the the greatest writers are now writing</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.789" end="00:37:17.019" style="s2">for TV the important thing to understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.930" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">is is that it&#39;s not just the advent of</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:27.369" style="s2">having the courage to say something</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.289" end="00:37:36.490" style="s2">anybody and the only reason that the IDW</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.740" end="00:37:39.849" style="s2">is behaving in a different fashion is</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.490" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">that it&#39;s Merritt marrying the content</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.849" end="00:37:46.450" style="s2">that brave people are starved for with</p>

<p begin="00:37:58.420" end="00:38:04.029" style="s2">of the aisle has gone so completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.220" end="00:38:06.460" style="s2">insane that people are starved for</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.749" end="00:38:17.769" style="s2">you have an underground network if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.059" end="00:38:20.829" style="s2">will that is supplying that need for</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.829" end="00:38:25.809" style="s2">underground is because the mainstream is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.039" end="00:38:27.579" style="s2">pretending for the most part not to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.809" end="00:38:29.410" style="s2">notice that this phenomena is existing</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.579" end="00:38:31.329" style="s2">which is fascinating and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.410" end="00:38:34.089" style="s2">described this as a civil war within the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.329" end="00:38:38.619" style="s2">left could you can you explain what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.089" end="00:38:41.769" style="s2">mean by that sure the left that I relate</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.619" end="00:38:44.859" style="s2">to is the left that realizes that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.769" end="00:38:46.839" style="s2">past cannot supply the answers and that</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.859" end="00:38:51.099" style="s2">we have to actually progress because we</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.839" end="00:38:53.289" style="s2">can&#39;t stay here it is not the left that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.099" end="00:38:55.869" style="s2">believes we can wish ourselves into a</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.289" end="00:38:57.590" style="s2">beautiful future by pretending that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.869" end="00:39:00.140" style="s2">read that the world is different</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.590" end="00:39:02.450" style="s2">it actually is so I think that the key</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.140" end="00:39:05.240" style="s2">thing that it is an agreement between</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.450" end="00:39:07.940" style="s2">these two groups is that we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.240" end="00:39:10.330" style="s2">to some sort of better place and that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.940" end="00:39:13.670" style="s2">that the progressive in progressivism</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.330" end="00:39:15.050" style="s2">where we are deeply divided and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.670" end="00:39:16.910" style="s2">again these are the divisions that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.050" end="00:39:22.730" style="s2">is much worse than between left and</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.910" end="00:39:25.730" style="s2">right how these absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.730" end="00:39:28.760" style="s2">imbecilic figures believe that you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.730" end="00:39:30.290" style="s2">just wish yourself into paradise that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.760" end="00:39:32.600" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to worry about markets</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.290" end="00:39:35.060" style="s2">that you can just say you know three</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.600" end="00:39:37.430" style="s2">good things for everybody well it just</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.060" end="00:39:39.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make a whit of sense or you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.430" end="00:39:42.740" style="s2">you&#39;re going to wish human beings to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.410" end="00:39:44.990" style="s2">both simultaneously non-diverse so that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.740" end="00:39:47.810" style="s2">you can argue that any difference in</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.990" end="00:39:50.750" style="s2">pro-rata shares of a group in any</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.810" end="00:39:52.400" style="s2">occupation is evidence of oppression and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.750" end="00:39:53.420" style="s2">then you&#39;re going to turn around and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:54.980" style="s2">argue that people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.420" end="00:39:57.820" style="s2">incredibly different because we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.980" end="00:40:01.810" style="s2">get a huge benefit from diversity I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.820" end="00:40:04.060" style="s2">this is not even self consistent this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.810" end="00:40:06.590" style="s2">this would be offensive to an</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.060" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">intelligent five-year-old so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.590" end="00:40:11.690" style="s2">really believe that these progressives</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:14.750" style="s2">as they call themselves and regressives</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.690" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">as some of us call them are even making</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.750" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">serious intellectual points they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:24.050" style="s2">of trolling by pretending to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:26.090" style="s2">all things that just gum up the works</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.050" end="00:40:28.570" style="s2">and so it&#39;s very important to me that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.090" end="00:40:31.910" style="s2">not only do we not really spend time</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.570" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">debating people who are not serious in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.910" end="00:40:36.620" style="s2">their intellectualism but that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:40.010" style="s2">realize that it is important to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.620" end="00:40:45.430" style="s2">diversity of mature and important ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.010" end="00:40:48.650" style="s2">that we not spend undue effort engaging</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.430" end="00:40:50.750" style="s2">ideas that are functioning very</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.650" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">differently from regular conversation it</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.750" end="00:40:58.210" style="s2">is as if somebody asks should we have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:41:00.530" style="s2">diverse dinner tonight well we could</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.210" end="00:41:02.930" style="s2">invite somebody from this position from</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.530" end="00:41:04.490" style="s2">that country from this gender and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.930" end="00:41:05.090" style="s2">should we should we invite a suicide</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.490" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">bomber</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.090" end="00:41:09.710" style="s2">well if you&#39;re a suicide bomber you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:11.869" style="s2">that bit of diversity is going to take</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.710" end="00:41:13.599" style="s2">down the entire conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.869" end="00:41:15.859" style="s2">as well as all the people at the table</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.599" end="00:41:18.769" style="s2">right well these are like suicide</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.859" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">bombers in terms of their ideas they are</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.769" end="00:41:22.369" style="s2">attaching themselves to real</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:24.619" style="s2">conversations and blowing up the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.369" end="00:41:28.069" style="s2">conversation so that you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.619" end="00:41:30.799" style="s2">speak and I think what we need is we</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.069" end="00:41:35.480" style="s2">need to realize that the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.799" end="00:41:38.210" style="s2">ideas that have to be explored hinges</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.480" end="00:41:40.519" style="s2">are not allowing in bad diversity that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.210" end="00:41:42.380" style="s2">is you don&#39;t want a single person at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.519" end="00:41:45.259" style="s2">table who wants to scuttle the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.380" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">conversation and that&#39;s not something</p>

<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:52.630" style="s2">left the modern left is very often</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.999" end="00:41:56.059" style="s2">focused on scuttling any realistic</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.630" end="00:41:58.819" style="s2">conversation so that it can continue to</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.559" end="00:42:08.359" style="s2">you think it&#39;s become like this well I</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.829" end="00:42:10.940" style="s2">think my wife probably has the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.359" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">explanation which is that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.940" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">actually dependent on labor for your</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:18.619" style="s2">voter base labor has economic issues so</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">this is the great search for something</p>
