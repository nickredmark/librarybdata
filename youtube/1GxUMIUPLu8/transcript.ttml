<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:06.710" style="s2">more of an in-person interaction so</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.780" end="00:01:08.600" style="s2">there will be less talking but to begin</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.710" end="00:01:11.960" style="s2">again some housekeeping please turn on</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.250" end="00:01:20.570" style="s2">vulnerable and don&#39;t have to worry about</p>

<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:43.670" style="s2">like how can we use accountability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:45.260" style="s2">maintain sovereignty and respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.670" end="00:01:46.810" style="s2">medic crisis and I&#39;m gonna try to sum up</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.260" end="00:01:52.970" style="s2">everything we talked about last week in</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.810" end="00:01:55.340" style="s2">this singular slide so this is where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.970" end="00:01:58.430" style="s2">want to go right there&#39;s a crisis right</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.340" end="00:01:59.990" style="s2">now and it&#39;s unclear what each</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.430" end="00:02:00.650" style="s2">individual is supposed to do in response</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.990" end="00:02:03.500" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.650" end="00:02:05.420" style="s2">last week we talked about how the</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.500" end="00:02:07.190" style="s2">quality of a response to this crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.420" end="00:02:09.979" style="s2">going to be a product of our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.190" end="00:02:12.019" style="s2">make good choices and our ability to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.979" end="00:02:14.390" style="s2">make sense of what&#39;s going on to know up</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.019" end="00:02:15.730" style="s2">from down and all of that rests on</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.390" end="00:02:19.010" style="s2">something called personal sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.730" end="00:02:20.840" style="s2">which I defined as your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.010" end="00:02:22.819" style="s2">respond to something as opposed to react</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.840" end="00:02:23.689" style="s2">to it the opposite of personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.819" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">sovereignty would be when you get</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.689" end="00:02:27.630" style="s2">emotionally activated by something</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">and from there it gets a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.630" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">abstract we talked about how personal</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">sovereignty is really the product of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.520" style="s2">managing your physiology and managing</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:37.560" style="s2">your addictions in the camp of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.520" end="00:02:39.600" style="s2">physiology we talked about how sleep</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.560" end="00:02:42.060" style="s2">nutrition exercise and meditation are</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:43.709" style="s2">the fundamentals and to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.060" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">we are practicing these things we are up</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.709" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">regulating our sovereignty and we talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">about managing our addictions and how we</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:53.010" style="s2">live in an environment full of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:55.290" style="s2">supernormal stimuli all these dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.010" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">activating vehicles that continually</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.290" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">draw our attention away from what</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">matters most so some examples being</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">social media news pornography and video</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:05.820" style="s2">games and so managing your addictions is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:08.160" style="s2">another fundamental step for personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.820" end="00:03:11.250" style="s2">sovereignty and all of this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.160" end="00:03:13.459" style="s2">be upregulated through accountability</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.250" end="00:03:15.959" style="s2">and this is what I&#39;m referring to as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.459" end="00:03:19.830" style="s2">metagame mastermind or these digital</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.959" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">gangs in summary to manage your</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.830" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">physiology last week we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:25.830" style="s2">life practices so maybe waking up early</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">is an example for managing your</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.830" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">addictions we talked about negation so</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">deleting your Netflix account would be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.220" end="00:03:34.380" style="s2">negation and in the third category that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:36.570" style="s2">we started to get into but is admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.380" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">the most challenging of the three was</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.570" end="00:03:40.380" style="s2">giving your best gifts for the current</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:44.220" style="s2">moment and that all throw in the camp of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.380" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">a response to the meta crisis so these</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.220" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">mastermind groups that were prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:50.519" style="s2">this digital gang is going to be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">service of these three and tonight I</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.519" end="00:03:54.600" style="s2">want to go specifically into this one</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:56.880" style="s2">what does it mean to give your best gift</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">how can we take a first pass at</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.880" end="00:04:03.239" style="s2">discovering what that is and this first</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.010" style="s2">pass idea I am framing it as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.239" end="00:04:06.840" style="s2">provisional purpose what&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.010" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">something provisional something for a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.840" end="00:04:10.470" style="s2">period of time that you can perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:12.900" style="s2">commit to with a group of people that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.470" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">you can think of as a shitty first draft</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.900" end="00:04:16.350" style="s2">of your best gifts for the current</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.609" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">moment last week I got some really</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.350" end="00:04:21.450" style="s2">interesting feedback about how when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:23.820" style="s2">say best gift it&#39;s kind of daunting it</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.450" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">makes you think of something that might</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.820" end="00:04:27.600" style="s2">take you years to discover and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:29.820" style="s2">tonight we&#39;re going to compress that as</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.600" end="00:04:34.229" style="s2">much as possible and see if we can get a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.820" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">clue as to what that gift might be here</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.229" end="00:04:37.740" style="s2">are some clues about gifts so I took</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:39.639" style="s2">this from this really great article</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.740" end="00:04:42.460" style="s2">which I&#39;ll share at the end</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.639" end="00:04:44.110" style="s2">Danish Mountain burger on how to inquire</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.460" end="00:04:45.699" style="s2">into what your purpose could be and he</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.110" end="00:04:48.009" style="s2">broke it down into these three</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.699" end="00:04:51.039" style="s2">categories your capacities values and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.009" end="00:04:52.840" style="s2">propensity capacities refer to what is</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.840" end="00:04:58.120" style="s2">values have to do with what you think is</p>

<p begin="00:04:58.120" end="00:05:07.029" style="s2">you drawn to maybe your your talents are</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:09.069" style="s2">also in this category so we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.029" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">into a breakout session but before I do</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.069" end="00:05:12.340" style="s2">that I just want to share this quote</p>

<p begin="00:05:18.069" end="00:05:21.189" style="s2">everyone&#39;s been talking about the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.449" end="00:05:23.139" style="s2">crisis we&#39;re talking about how Kovach 19</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.139" end="00:05:26.740" style="s2">bigger and something much more</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.029" end="00:05:28.360" style="s2">complicated and there have been many</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.740" end="00:05:30.639" style="s2">different ways of framing what this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.360" end="00:05:33.400" style="s2">bigger more complicated thing is and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.639" end="00:05:35.529" style="s2">found this recently I&#39;m just gonna read</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.400" end="00:05:38.259" style="s2">it to you I believe that the core of</p>
