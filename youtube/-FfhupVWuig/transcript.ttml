<p begin="00:00:04.310" end="00:00:09.240" style="s2">this update to our sense-making series</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.410" end="00:00:12.300" style="s2">which started about a month ago with</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.240" end="00:00:13.799" style="s2">what the fuck is going on and in that</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.300" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">film i talked about the crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.799" end="00:00:18.119" style="s2">journalism especially the crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">American journalism American media and</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.119" end="00:00:22.740" style="s2">so much has happened even in the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:25.500" style="s2">few weeks and few days but I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.740" end="00:00:28.019" style="s2">worth doing an update and I think why</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.500" end="00:00:30.060" style="s2">this is so significant is that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.019" end="00:00:32.660" style="s2">crisis with an American journalism but</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">by extension it&#39;s a crisis within</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.660" end="00:00:37.980" style="s2">truth-seeking within sense-making and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">this has huge consequences for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.980" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">in the rest of the world I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:44.219" style="s2">the things that may be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">unexpected consequences of the big tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.219" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">platforms kind of domination the fact</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:50.160" style="s2">that almost all of us get most of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:52.590" style="s2">media through the tech platforms is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.160" end="00:00:55.350" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of globalized the American</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.590" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">culture war to the rest of the world so</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.350" end="00:01:00.629" style="s2">we&#39;re all influenced by it whether or</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">not we want to be and just on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.629" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">there&#39;s another film coming up in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">next couple of days with Tristan Harris</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">who&#39;s been described as the conscience</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">of Silicon Valley who&#39;s made it his</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">mission to look at how the big tech</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">platforms are boosting polarization</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.520" style="s2">boosting division and what we might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:19.470" style="s2">able to do about it to get attention</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.520" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">within that debt sphere I have to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.470" end="00:01:23.369" style="s2">outrage so both sides the left and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">right are using outrage to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.369" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">get to get people&#39;s attention and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">that just further Cleaves the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:30.390" style="s2">divide so just in the last few days</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">they&#39;ve been a few really major events</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.390" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">in American media Barry Weiss the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:36.540" style="s2">opinion editor at The New York Times who</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:38.850" style="s2">wrote the original intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.540" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">piece and has been a sort of champion of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.850" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">heterodox opinion within the New York</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">Times has left with a really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:49.799" style="s2">biting and quite detailed resignation</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">letter and also Andrew Sullivan who was</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.799" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">one of the few conservative columnist</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">sat the New York Magazine has also left</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">so I think the overall frame for Barry</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:00.740" style="s2">Weiss in the New York Times just</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">something she talks about in a letter is</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.740" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">that the election of Trump in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:07.500" style="s2">should have been a time for people on</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">the more liberal side to stop and think</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.500" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">about why people were voting for Trump</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:13.390" style="s2">what it was about kind of the way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:15.490" style="s2">liberalism was showing up</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.390" end="00:02:17.650" style="s2">the increased kind of intolerance with</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.490" end="00:02:19.180" style="s2">other views that was making people or</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.650" end="00:02:21.100" style="s2">pushing people towards Trump and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.180" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">actually the opposite seems to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.100" end="00:02:25.569" style="s2">happened so she says in her resignation</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:27.430" style="s2">letter the lessons that ought to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.569" end="00:02:28.810" style="s2">followed the election lessons about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.430" end="00:02:31.270" style="s2">importance of understanding other</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.810" end="00:02:33.130" style="s2">Americans the necessity of resisting</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.270" end="00:02:35.350" style="s2">tribalism the centrality of the free</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.130" end="00:02:38.440" style="s2">exchange of ideas to a Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.350" end="00:02:40.360" style="s2">Society have not been learned instead a</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.440" end="00:02:43.630" style="s2">new consensus has emerged in the press</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.360" end="00:02:45.550" style="s2">but perhaps especially at this paper the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.630" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">truth isn&#39;t a process of collective</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.550" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">discovery but an orthodoxy already known</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:53.380" style="s2">to an enlightened few whose job is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.910" style="s2">inform everyone else but the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.380" end="00:02:56.440" style="s2">I wanted to talk about was the Harper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.910" end="00:02:58.450" style="s2">letter there was a letter that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.440" end="00:03:00.370" style="s2">originally conceived of by Thomas</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.450" end="00:03:03.250" style="s2">Chatterton Williams who we had on</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.370" end="00:03:04.989" style="s2">recently on this channel and it brought</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.250" end="00:03:07.690" style="s2">together the attempt was to draw a line</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.989" end="00:03:10.150" style="s2">in the sand so three paragraphs of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.690" end="00:03:12.160" style="s2">fairly mild defenses of free speech and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.150" end="00:03:14.530" style="s2">calling out the attacks on free speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.160" end="00:03:17.320" style="s2">on both the right and the left that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.530" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">then signed by a host of people from</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.320" end="00:03:22.079" style="s2">academia from the literary world</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:25.720" style="s2">including people like Salman Rushdie</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.079" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">Margaret Atwood Noam Chomsky Malcolm</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.720" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">Gladwell and JK Rowling but it caused a</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:33.250" style="s2">huge backlash so to unpack all of this I</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:34.660" style="s2">thought the best person to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:36.280" style="s2">would be Jessie single who we</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.660" end="00:03:38.890" style="s2">interviewed recently for the death of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.280" end="00:03:40.329" style="s2">journalism piece so Jessie&#39;s a freelance</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.890" end="00:03:43.239" style="s2">journalist who&#39;s written for a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.329" end="00:03:45.700" style="s2">these institutions and also has recently</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.239" end="00:03:48.190" style="s2">set up the blocks and reported podcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.700" end="00:03:51.310" style="s2">with Katy Hertzog so it kind of gives</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.190" end="00:03:54.160" style="s2">him a frontside view of everything</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.310" end="00:03:55.930" style="s2">that&#39;s going on but also gives him a</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.160" end="00:03:57.310" style="s2">certain sense of freedom and detachment</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.930" end="00:04:00.370" style="s2">from it now that allow them to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.310" end="00:04:02.920" style="s2">speak his mind we recorded only like</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.370" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">three weeks ago with a piece that I put</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.920" end="00:04:05.890" style="s2">out called the death of journalism which</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:09.459" style="s2">I thought might be a little bit kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.890" end="00:04:13.000" style="s2">click Beatty but it doesn&#39;t appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.459" end="00:04:15.190" style="s2">and like this kind of dumpster fire or I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:17.950" style="s2">think what you called an epistemic break</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.190" end="00:04:20.380" style="s2">in journalism sort of has continued to</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.950" end="00:04:22.870" style="s2">ramp up over the last kind of couple of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.380" end="00:04:25.599" style="s2">weeks since we spoke last I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.870" end="00:04:26.860" style="s2">start by by that frame like you said an</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.599" end="00:04:28.270" style="s2">epistemic break and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.860" end="00:04:30.159" style="s2">felt really right to me like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.270" end="00:04:31.629" style="s2">something in the norms and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.159" end="00:04:34.419" style="s2">things have happened over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.629" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">weeks that seems to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.419" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">something&#39;s really shifted so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.430" end="00:04:39.939" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk about that first and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:41.979" style="s2">talk about what some of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.939" end="00:04:46.419" style="s2">events are for people who maybe aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.979" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">on twitter as much as we are and and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.419" end="00:04:50.259" style="s2">think i did this last time but i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:53.889" style="s2">to first apologize for my Haggard jewish</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.259" end="00:04:55.360" style="s2">caveman look this is a an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.889" end="00:04:56.949" style="s2">during the pandemic I&#39;m usually a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.360" end="00:05:01.689" style="s2">bit more put together than this but um</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.949" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s important to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.689" end="00:05:06.219" style="s2">this stuff in a clear way</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:07.389" style="s2">I think journalism still the majority or</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.219" end="00:05:09.699" style="s2">the vast majority of people in</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.389" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">journalism writing journalism because</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.699" end="00:05:13.779" style="s2">they&#39;re interested in the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:15.550" style="s2">they&#39;re not just in it out of politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.779" end="00:05:17.259" style="s2">they they might have politics like mine</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.550" end="00:05:18.490" style="s2">that are broadly progressive and they</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.259" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">don&#39;t hide that but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.490" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">different from seeing Paul journalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:25.449" style="s2">specifically as like a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:28.120" style="s2">advancing very narrow political claims</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.449" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">and what we&#39;re basically seeing is like</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.120" end="00:05:32.529" style="s2">less and less of a sense that journalism</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:34.210" style="s2">is separate from activism journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.529" end="00:05:37.719" style="s2">just sort of employed as a tool for</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.210" end="00:05:39.000" style="s2">activism and as I wrote about in my in</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.719" end="00:05:41.229" style="s2">my newsletter</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.000" end="00:05:43.180" style="s2">they&#39;ve just been sort of a series of</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.229" end="00:05:44.770" style="s2">alarm bells in recent years about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.180" end="00:05:46.539" style="s2">one of them was was the big covington</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.770" end="00:05:50.460" style="s2">case where a short video seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.539" end="00:05:52.569" style="s2">indicate that a group of mostly white</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.460" end="00:05:54.839" style="s2">kids from the catholic school were</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.569" end="00:05:57.520" style="s2">harassing a Native American activist I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.839" end="00:05:59.319" style="s2">watched as professional journalists even</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.520" end="00:06:01.449" style="s2">when a longer video was revealed that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.319" end="00:06:03.159" style="s2">that really made it seem much more</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.449" end="00:06:04.930" style="s2">complicated in that and much more like</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.159" end="00:06:06.610" style="s2">the activists sort of walked into the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.930" end="00:06:08.860" style="s2">circle of kids who are already chanting</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.610" end="00:06:11.139" style="s2">and cheering then that they had harassed</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.860" end="00:06:12.370" style="s2">him anyway the worst thing you could say</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.139" end="00:06:13.990" style="s2">about some of these kids was that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.370" end="00:06:15.819" style="s2">did the tomahawk chop which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.990" end="00:06:17.289" style="s2">considered offensive by some Native</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.819" end="00:06:18.969" style="s2">Americans but it&#39;s also something tens</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.289" end="00:06:21.370" style="s2">of thousands of American sports fans do</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.969" end="00:06:22.839" style="s2">every day if any of your viewers are</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.370" end="00:06:26.139" style="s2">confused by that you can just google it</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.839" end="00:06:27.939" style="s2">and get an explanation so I what in</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.139" end="00:06:31.210" style="s2">online and offline discussions I watched</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.939" end="00:06:32.740" style="s2">journalists refused to see what was</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.210" end="00:06:34.419" style="s2">before their own eyes like the video</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.740" end="00:06:36.310" style="s2">certain aspects of this were made very</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.419" end="00:06:38.289" style="s2">clear by the video but it seemed like</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.310" end="00:06:40.490" style="s2">this sort of incentives to come out</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.289" end="00:06:42.349" style="s2">against the Covington kids because</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.490" end="00:06:43.580" style="s2">we need it either before or against</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.349" end="00:06:45.349" style="s2">everything and there can never be any</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.580" end="00:06:47.590" style="s2">complexity worse we&#39;re so overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.349" end="00:06:50.449" style="s2">that people just sort of let their own</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.590" end="00:06:52.099" style="s2">values and social incentives override</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.449" end="00:06:54.229" style="s2">what was on a video in front of it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.099" end="00:06:56.240" style="s2">it was very much people of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.229" end="00:06:58.550" style="s2">overuse or well in these situations but</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:07:00.169" style="s2">that whole like how many blinking lights</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.550" end="00:07:02.060" style="s2">are in front of you not being able to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.169" end="00:07:05.690" style="s2">say what the answer is disturb the hell</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.060" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">out of me and Covington was not the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.690" end="00:07:11.960" style="s2">important story by a longshot but but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:13.550" style="s2">just pointed to these trajectories in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.960" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">journalism that just worried the hell</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.550" end="00:07:20.139" style="s2">out of me and and that are bad so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:22.750" style="s2">the long winded under caffeinated answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.139" end="00:07:25.400" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.750" end="00:07:27.380" style="s2">it&#39;s the Asch conformity experiment</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.400" end="00:07:29.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t it where you have the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.380" end="00:07:30.830" style="s2">three people give a wrong answer and all</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.150" end="00:07:33.080" style="s2">of them are in on it and it&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.830" end="00:07:34.460" style="s2">person who goes along or doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.080" end="00:07:37.490" style="s2">along even though what they&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.460" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">front of their eyes is is not and is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.490" end="00:07:43.009" style="s2">true well not only that but I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.120" style="s2">the Asch conformity experiment which i</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.009" end="00:07:45.380" style="s2">think some of the results have been</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.120" end="00:07:46.699" style="s2">overplayed over the years because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.380" end="00:07:48.280" style="s2">of people did not go with the crowd I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.699" end="00:07:50.719" style="s2">forget the exact number either way</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.280" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy Dan kahan at yeah well I</p>

<p begin="00:07:54.740" end="00:07:58.340" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of psychology and he has</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.180" end="00:08:00.380" style="s2">this idea that our views on these issues</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.340" end="00:08:02.210" style="s2">are really determined by our social</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.380" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2">networks and and our religious and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.210" end="00:08:06.229" style="s2">political networks and the Asch</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:08.090" style="s2">conformity experiment showed that even</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.229" end="00:08:10.099" style="s2">in a situation where there&#39;s no moral or</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.090" end="00:08:11.990" style="s2">political valence where the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.099" end="00:08:13.520" style="s2">at stake was you know going against a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.990" end="00:08:15.020" style="s2">group of strangers a fair number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.520" end="00:08:17.419" style="s2">people would give an objectively wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.020" end="00:08:19.190" style="s2">answer to not go against the crowd you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.419" end="00:08:20.719" style="s2">add to that the sense that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.190" end="00:08:24.139" style="s2">something morally or politically wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.719" end="00:08:26.449" style="s2">or that you&#39;re sort of going against the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.139" end="00:08:28.490" style="s2">group or betraying the group and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.449" end="00:08:31.490" style="s2">people just go crazy and then you add</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.490" end="00:08:33.099" style="s2">the social media landscape which is</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.490" end="00:08:35.990" style="s2">brutal where you get instant feedback</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.099" end="00:08:38.029" style="s2">with every opinion you express and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.990" end="00:08:41.209" style="s2">just it&#39;s adding up to something really</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.029" end="00:08:42.620" style="s2">ugly that this is not the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.209" end="00:08:45.529" style="s2">journalism&#39;s problems the cause of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.620" end="00:08:47.329" style="s2">journalism problems are wide-ranging and</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.529" end="00:08:48.040" style="s2">structural and journalism is totally</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.329" end="00:08:50.839" style="s2">screwed</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.040" end="00:08:52.940" style="s2">but journalism is in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.839" end="00:08:54.290" style="s2">furthering its own screwing or</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.940" end="00:08:56.600" style="s2">accelerating it by</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.290" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">by just adopting these really bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.600" end="00:09:01.070" style="s2">standards that the average person</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">understands and can see what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.070" end="00:09:04.820" style="s2">and that it&#39;s increasingly not about</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:07.580" style="s2">truth or journalism</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.820" end="00:09:08.300" style="s2">as so so let&#39;s just recap sort of some</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.580" end="00:09:11.450" style="s2">of the things that have happened</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.300" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">recently there was the the Harper&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.450" end="00:09:16.850" style="s2">letter which was quite a kind of Anna</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:18.980" style="s2">dying fairly vanilla letter which was</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.850" end="00:09:21.020" style="s2">three paragraphs of sort of talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.980" end="00:09:23.630" style="s2">about the value of free expression and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.020" end="00:09:25.610" style="s2">may pains to criticize both sides it</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.630" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">talked about the right as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.610" end="00:09:29.960" style="s2">left but talked about a censorious</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:31.430" style="s2">nasaan the left that was signed by a</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.960" end="00:09:35.210" style="s2">huge number of kind of the great and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.430" end="00:09:38.060" style="s2">good of writers and any poker one sir</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.210" end="00:09:39.830" style="s2">and some mediocre ones to the great ones</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.060" end="00:09:41.990" style="s2">like yourself and Katie and then some</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.830" end="00:09:44.780" style="s2">people no one&#39;s ever heard of like sarin</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.990" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">rush to hassle you know Salman Rushdie</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.780" end="00:09:49.000" style="s2">those many people but then it just</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.580" end="00:09:51.290" style="s2">caused this incredible shit show online</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.000" end="00:09:52.790" style="s2">even while the left it was was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.290" end="00:09:55.010" style="s2">kind of mild and what it was what it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.790" end="00:09:56.930" style="s2">kind of trying to assert mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.010" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">outlets immediately just misrepresented</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.930" end="00:10:01.610" style="s2">the letter and basically crept right up</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:02.900" style="s2">to the line of lying about this because</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.610" end="00:10:04.760" style="s2">that&#39;s if you&#39;re responding to a letter</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.900" end="00:10:05.960" style="s2">by saying this person saying acts when</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.760" end="00:10:09.500" style="s2">they didn&#39;t say X that&#39;s pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.960" end="00:10:11.270" style="s2">a lie or a bad faith reading and tried</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.500" end="00:10:12.910" style="s2">to impugn the motives of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.270" end="00:10:15.140" style="s2">the letter who signed the letter without</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.910" end="00:10:16.700" style="s2">pointing to any evidence they believed</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.140" end="00:10:18.710" style="s2">what you claim they believe there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.700" end="00:10:20.930" style="s2">these sort of bad faith and and since</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.710" end="00:10:22.220" style="s2">aureus maneuvers that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.930" end="00:10:23.900" style="s2">environment we&#39;re in right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.220" end="00:10:25.780" style="s2">not fun and I think what pissed me off</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.900" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">the most of all it was people saying</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.780" end="00:10:30.890" style="s2">there was a counter letter that said</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.070" end="00:10:32.240" style="s2">that look at these powerful people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.890" end="00:10:33.260" style="s2">signed a letter they&#39;re afraid they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:11:57.260" end="00:12:02.990" style="s2">is not good and I&#39;m including myself in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:04.730" style="s2">this yeah I agree I think going into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.990" end="00:12:06.650" style="s2">kind of minutiae I of it is very inside</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.730" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">baseball and seems very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.650" end="00:12:10.070" style="s2">self-indulgent which is why I thought</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:12.620" style="s2">that the main piece was the epistemic</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.070" end="00:12:14.900" style="s2">break like what does it mean if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.620" end="00:12:18.020" style="s2">an organization that is supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.900" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">aligned around truth but actually you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.020" end="00:12:21.470" style="s2">seeing an increasing lack of truth in</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:23.540" style="s2">sort of what&#39;s being reported that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.470" end="00:12:26.240" style="s2">I think the epistemic break piece is</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.540" end="00:12:27.770" style="s2">such a vital point to come back to when</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.240" end="00:12:30.080" style="s2">you&#39;re actually talking about situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.770" end="00:12:31.370" style="s2">and people are misrepresenting or</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.080" end="00:12:32.930" style="s2">ignoring the facts of that situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.370" end="00:12:36.410" style="s2">like that seems to be a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.930" end="00:12:38.060" style="s2">fundamental problem yeah yeah I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.410" end="00:12:39.710" style="s2">mean that that isn&#39;t inside baseball</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.060" end="00:12:41.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the question of how big outlets</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.710" end="00:12:42.770" style="s2">do their job and like you know one of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.240" end="00:12:44.990" style="s2">newsletters is about the epistemic break</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.770" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">I mentioned Cummington another was you</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.990" end="00:12:48.980" style="s2">know Vox purporting to investigate and</p>

<p begin="00:12:57.770" end="00:13:01.220" style="s2">conflict within the times and I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:03.080" style="s2">there are multiple people on the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.220" end="00:13:06.470" style="s2">side of it even I not particularly</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.080" end="00:13:08.270" style="s2">well-connected it&#39;s just these norms</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.470" end="00:13:10.610" style="s2">about how journalism is conducted matter</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.270" end="00:13:12.380" style="s2">a lot and I want to keep that separate</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.610" end="00:13:16.100" style="s2">from the sort of online drama shit show</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.380" end="00:13:17.690" style="s2">that&#39;s raging 24/7 but um yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.100" end="00:13:20.000" style="s2">epistemic breach and and the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.690" end="00:13:21.710" style="s2">collapse of journalistic norms in some</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.000" end="00:13:24.080" style="s2">corners of progressive journalism it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.710" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">big deal it affects what stories you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.080" end="00:13:29.210" style="s2">and how they&#39;re covered and how major</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:31.190" style="s2">issues are approached so as I said the</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.640" end="00:13:53.480" style="s2">preclude the possibility of dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.610" end="00:13:56.290" style="s2">that&#39;s what the idea that there&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.290" end="00:14:01.510" style="s2">convinced is a real problem in today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.810" end="00:14:05.540" style="s2">discourse is this idea of identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.510" end="00:14:07.460" style="s2">epistemology that because I am black I</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:28.460" style="s2">that can&#39;t work that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.200" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">backlash there like we talked in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:39.830" style="s2">short-term power grabs this is partially</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.830" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">but this is partially how we did end up</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.420" end="00:14:46.640" style="s2">with someone like Trump resonating so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:50.120" style="s2">wildly we&#39;re creating a society where</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.640" end="00:14:53.390" style="s2">everybody has an identity that gives</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.560" end="00:15:00.940" style="s2">their identity and it gives them some</p>

<p begin="00:15:00.940" end="00:15:06.110" style="s2">except for one group and that one group</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.890" end="00:15:07.550" style="s2">is the the group that&#39;s historically</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.110" end="00:15:10.760" style="s2">been in power and that is aware that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.550" end="00:15:12.530" style="s2">it&#39;s demographically shrinking so what</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.760" end="00:15:14.390" style="s2">does that set up that sets up a</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.380" end="00:15:38.330" style="s2">back to the blue church which Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.780" end="00:15:40.910" style="s2">Hall talks about as the system that kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.330" end="00:15:42.460" style="s2">of arose after the Second World War and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.910" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">was really based on a kind of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.460" end="00:15:45.649" style="s2">modality and how that was increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">challenged</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.649" end="00:15:52.040" style="s2">by decentralized media the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:53.930" style="s2">emerged in the context of having to</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.040" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">figure out how to navigate all of these</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.930" end="00:15:58.759" style="s2">changes in generate coherence how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">get all of these people with these new</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.759" end="00:16:03.350" style="s2">capacities to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:05.389" style="s2">the world in some fashion that is able</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.350" end="00:16:07.100" style="s2">to then make choices together and to act</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.389" end="00:16:11.689" style="s2">effectively right that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.100" end="00:16:13.579" style="s2">and the blue church developed to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.689" end="00:16:15.170" style="s2">answer that question answer developed</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.579" end="00:16:18.490" style="s2">the ability to say for example use the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.170" end="00:16:22.220" style="s2">education system to establish an</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.490" end="00:16:28.420" style="s2">embodied sense of vertical meritocratic</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.220" end="00:16:31.639" style="s2">hierarchy the idea that some people are</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.420" end="00:16:34.339" style="s2">better at others in knowing certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.639" end="00:16:36.410" style="s2">kinds of things we can find them and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.339" end="00:16:38.509" style="s2">then we empower them to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.410" end="00:16:40.220" style="s2">hierarchical authority in the structure</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.509" end="00:16:42.740" style="s2">that we&#39;re in there is a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.220" end="00:16:44.569" style="s2">between authority and receptor that has</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.740" end="00:16:47.019" style="s2">a broadcast modality so the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.569" end="00:16:49.309" style="s2">is very broadcast across its entire mode</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.019" end="00:16:51.709" style="s2">so what I mean by a broadcast of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.309" end="00:16:55.790" style="s2">is exemplified in television which is to</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.709" end="00:16:59.149" style="s2">say that some small number of people get</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.790" end="00:17:01.009" style="s2">to speak and a very very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.149" end="00:17:03.980" style="s2">people get to listen and is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.009" end="00:17:06.380" style="s2">different and then say but we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.980" end="00:17:07.760" style="s2">right here and this is symmetric well of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.380" end="00:17:08.959" style="s2">course I&#39;m the one speaking in principle</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.760" end="00:17:11.089" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing about this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.959" end="00:17:12.589" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t be perfectly symmetric but</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.089" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">in television and any kind of broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.589" end="00:17:17.240" style="s2">modality it&#39;s structurally that way so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:19.339" style="s2">Walter Cronkite tells the news and</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.240" end="00:17:20.990" style="s2">everybody else watches it and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.339" end="00:17:27.049" style="s2">lot of passivity there like my job is</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.990" end="00:17:30.110" style="s2">not to perceive what&#39;s going on make</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.049" end="00:17:32.929" style="s2">sense of it and then express it in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.929" end="00:17:38.210" style="s2">I&#39;m being told and be able to then</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.299" end="00:17:40.700" style="s2">express that story effectively in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.210" end="00:17:43.399" style="s2">society that I&#39;m in there&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.700" end="00:17:47.090" style="s2">reasons to believe that the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.399" end="00:17:50.210" style="s2">is done meaning that it&#39;s in the</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.090" end="00:17:57.020" style="s2">downhill pretty quickly so I&#39;m expecting</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.460" end="00:17:58.900" style="s2">to see the blue church sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.020" end="00:18:02.500" style="s2">increasingly obvious</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.900" end="00:18:06.650" style="s2">failing and increasingly obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.500" end="00:18:11.030" style="s2">losing the habitual or unconscious or</p>

<p begin="00:18:11.030" end="00:18:15.620" style="s2">and being just reality more and more</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.160" end="00:18:18.410" style="s2">people are going to be going ah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.620" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">thing that&#39;s not the whole thing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.410" end="00:18:21.110" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s kind of doing something</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:23.090" style="s2">and maybe parts of it are still good but</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.110" end="00:18:25.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not the whole thing and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.090" end="00:18:27.380" style="s2">be increasingly fucked up and in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.370" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">meantime looking around going okay now</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.380" end="00:18:32.680" style="s2">what that&#39;s the key I run our in a space</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.230" end="00:18:37.400" style="s2">we&#39;re in that space between 1918 and</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.680" end="00:18:42.070" style="s2">1945 or in the space between 1077 BC and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.400" end="00:18:44.570" style="s2">800 BC where there&#39;s a gap between a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.070" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">coherent collective intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.570" end="00:18:48.500" style="s2">coherent structure of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">respond as a whole to what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.500" end="00:18:52.700" style="s2">and a new it not an old one a nooner and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:54.110" style="s2">as if fading so we&#39;re witnessing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.700" end="00:18:55.400" style="s2">transition we&#39;re in the middle of it and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.110" end="00:18:59.030" style="s2">a lot of the phenomenon that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.400" end="00:19:02.540" style="s2">experiencing over the past what 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.030" end="00:19:08.210" style="s2">or so are of that sort starting around</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.540" end="00:19:09.380" style="s2">2000 ish particularly accelerating you</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.210" end="00:19:10.910" style="s2">can explain a lot of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:13.010" style="s2">happened it seemed very inexplicable</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.910" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">like brexit and Trump using this model</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.010" end="00:19:16.280" style="s2">so I think this is the most helpful</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:18.410" style="s2">frame to understand what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.280" end="00:19:20.050" style="s2">journalism at the moment we have an</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.410" end="00:19:22.400" style="s2">institution that was already</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.050" end="00:19:24.050" style="s2">increasingly fragile because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.400" end="00:19:26.150" style="s2">business model was being challenged by</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.050" end="00:19:28.310" style="s2">decentralized media and so as the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.150" end="00:19:31.130" style="s2">institutions get weaker they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.310" end="00:19:32.450" style="s2">vulnerable and able to be taken over do</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.130" end="00:19:34.820" style="s2">you think that it was sort of structural</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.450" end="00:19:36.680" style="s2">issues in journalism that have that have</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.820" end="00:19:39.140" style="s2">kind of got it to the point where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.680" end="00:19:41.750" style="s2">been taken over by this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.140" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">situation how do you frame it it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:45.950" style="s2">feels a bit like a kind of mirror of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.380" style="s2">of the whole pandemic to me like a week</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.950" end="00:19:51.380" style="s2">a week host being taken over via virus</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.380" end="00:19:52.550" style="s2">in double-quick time yeah we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.380" end="00:19:54.890" style="s2">about this a little too but some people</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.550" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s just like two simple catchphrase</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.890" end="00:19:58.940" style="s2">that particularly people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:01.580" style="s2">use like go won&#39;t go broke as though</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.940" end="00:20:03.170" style="s2">people are these journalists these</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.580" end="00:20:05.330" style="s2">outlets are struggling because of their</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.170" end="00:20:06.590" style="s2">political stances but I think Katie and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.330" end="00:20:08.060" style="s2">I both think the opposite is true is</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.590" end="00:20:10.820" style="s2">that the structural problems with</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.060" end="00:20:12.169" style="s2">journalism go so far beyond ideology</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.820" end="00:20:13.669" style="s2">there&#39;s just an entire</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.169" end="00:20:16.369" style="s2">business model has collapsed a business</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.669" end="00:20:17.989" style="s2">model that 30 years ago was such that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.369" end="00:20:19.549" style="s2">you know the Baltimore Sun and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.989" end="00:20:23.179" style="s2">Boston Globe could have foreign bureaus</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.549" end="00:20:25.100" style="s2">which is unthinkable now I think as an</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.179" end="00:20:27.109" style="s2">institution collapses the culture inside</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.100" end="00:20:29.659" style="s2">is going to get very weird and and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.109" end="00:20:31.399" style="s2">this case what you see basically is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.659" end="00:20:33.679" style="s2">whatever concerns upper-middle class</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.399" end="00:20:35.989" style="s2">graduates of elite universities is more</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.679" end="00:20:38.359" style="s2">and more what they care about and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.989" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">is where woke miss resides so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.359" end="00:20:41.929" style="s2">think I think obviously they feed back</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:43.249" style="s2">into one another because like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.929" end="00:20:44.570" style="s2">people will stop reading certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.249" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">publications as they get less and less</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.570" end="00:20:49.100" style="s2">trustworthy but overall I&#39;m much more in</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">the camp of go broke go woke and vice</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.100" end="00:20:53.179" style="s2">versa</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">yeah the structural stuff ISM is a much</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.179" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">bigger deal and it&#39;s long and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:58.639" style="s2">back decades this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.090" end="00:21:00.350" style="s2">Craigslist and then social media I mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.639" end="00:21:01.789" style="s2">the business models have totally</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.350" end="00:21:04.009" style="s2">collapse I mean just for instance like</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.789" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">the Seattle Times the big sort of daily</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.009" end="00:21:09.350" style="s2">paper here 20 years ago had 5,000</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:11.179" style="s2">staffers today they have sold their</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.350" end="00:21:13.850" style="s2">buildings they exist on two floors in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.179" end="00:21:15.679" style="s2">tiny building it was apparently the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.850" end="00:21:17.809" style="s2">publisher was offered like seven hundred</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.679" end="00:21:20.029" style="s2">and thirty million dollars in the early</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.809" end="00:21:21.889" style="s2">2000s from you know Gannett or some like</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.029" end="00:21:24.769" style="s2">major corporation to buy this paper and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.889" end="00:21:26.090" style="s2">today there&#39;s almost worthless so that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.769" end="00:21:28.460" style="s2">mean that&#39;s really the issue is that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.090" end="00:21:29.869" style="s2">industry is failing and the response the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.460" end="00:21:32.210" style="s2">responsive that has been for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.869" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">sort of go kind of crazy in some ways of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.210" end="00:21:35.840" style="s2">but it is not I think yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:37.940" style="s2">structural issues really precede sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.840" end="00:21:40.039" style="s2">the other things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.940" end="00:21:41.779" style="s2">within and I also think this is also</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.039" end="00:21:43.429" style="s2">part of a brother a broader trend in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.779" end="00:21:44.929" style="s2">culture a lot of which has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.429" end="00:21:47.629" style="s2">sort of backlash against Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.929" end="00:21:50.840" style="s2">and a lot of fear about you know him</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.629" end="00:21:51.980" style="s2">sort of ushering into people think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.840" end="00:21:53.960" style="s2">he&#39;s going to usher and you know do a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.980" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">nude age of fascism or authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.960" end="00:21:58.639" style="s2">and to the into the into the nation and</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:21:59.659" style="s2">so there&#39;s been this sort of Ben Smith</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.639" end="00:22:01.609" style="s2">from the New York Times calls it</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.659" end="00:22:02.600" style="s2">resistance journalism and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.609" end="00:22:04.220" style="s2">there has been a trend over the past</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.600" end="00:22:06.139" style="s2">couple years for journalists to really</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.220" end="00:22:07.369" style="s2">sort of see themselves more or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.139" end="00:22:08.950" style="s2">they still see themselves as journalists</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.369" end="00:22:11.059" style="s2">but they&#39;ve really turned into activists</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.950" end="00:22:12.739" style="s2">and you know and everybody sort of wants</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.059" end="00:22:14.869" style="s2">to be on the right side of history we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.739" end="00:22:17.809" style="s2">in such a weird moment in time that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.869" end="00:22:20.210" style="s2">people are deeply concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.809" end="00:22:22.399" style="s2">country understandably and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.210" end="00:22:23.720" style="s2">sort of do the right thing but do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.399" end="00:22:25.549" style="s2">right thing in this case often means</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.720" end="00:22:27.350" style="s2">sort of shaking off these</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.549" end="00:22:29.629" style="s2">values of journalism motive existed for</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.350" end="00:22:31.100" style="s2">a long time obviously Brett Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.629" end="00:22:32.629" style="s2">has thought about this as much as anyone</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.100" end="00:22:35.539" style="s2">after what happened to an evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.629" end="00:22:37.789" style="s2">college this is from a forthcoming piece</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.539" end="00:22:39.230" style="s2">that I&#39;ve got with him the connection</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.789" end="00:22:40.850" style="s2">between what&#39;s going on in the wider</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.230" end="00:22:43.249" style="s2">world and what took place at Evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.850" end="00:22:45.529" style="s2">is so close that it is unmistakable for</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.249" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">anybody who saw the initial episode</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.529" end="00:22:51.559" style="s2">unfold as closely as we did the reason</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:54.739" style="s2">that this is happening is that there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.559" end="00:22:57.289" style="s2">an epistemology that has existed for</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.739" end="00:23:02.299" style="s2">many years inside of the critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.289" end="00:23:05.090" style="s2">disciplines and it evolved into a method</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.299" end="00:23:08.119" style="s2">and that method had got tested in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.090" end="00:23:11.389" style="s2">microcosm of college environments</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.119" end="00:23:12.919" style="s2">especially evergreen so we experienced</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.389" end="00:23:15.350" style="s2">what it was like we discovered the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.919" end="00:23:17.629" style="s2">various tropes and now what we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.350" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">simply seeing is that as one should have</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.629" end="00:23:23.480" style="s2">predicted those who went to college and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:26.119" style="s2">learned this perspective have now moved</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.480" end="00:23:28.940" style="s2">into positions in society some of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.119" end="00:23:31.190" style="s2">in close proximity to power and they</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.940" end="00:23:33.289" style="s2">have now begun to exert that influence</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.190" end="00:23:35.509" style="s2">in artists when we saying that this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.289" end="00:23:36.950" style="s2">the evergreening of society what was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.509" end="00:23:40.299" style="s2">outcome of Evergreen because on one side</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.950" end="00:23:43.519" style="s2">you could kind of look at it as like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.299" end="00:23:45.019" style="s2">you&#39;ve sort of come out you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.519" end="00:23:46.580" style="s2">started up your own podcast you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.019" end="00:23:48.409" style="s2">actually kind of managed to land on your</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.580" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">feet so I think many people maybe think</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.409" end="00:23:52.820" style="s2">that evergreen ultimately was a success</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:56.149" style="s2">story of pushing back against the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.820" end="00:23:59.989" style="s2">radical there is that what happened yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.149" end="00:24:02.239" style="s2">and no the important thing to realize is</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.989" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">that there is a mapping of what happened</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.239" end="00:24:08.690" style="s2">at Evergreen and it it reflects various</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:10.489" style="s2">different outcomes so there is what</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.690" end="00:24:12.919" style="s2">happened to Evergreen there&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.489" end="00:24:15.830" style="s2">happened to Heather in to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.919" end="00:24:18.700" style="s2">there is what happened to the movement</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.830" end="00:24:20.989" style="s2">inside and if you track these things</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.700" end="00:24:24.019" style="s2">independently and then you map them on</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.989" end="00:24:25.820" style="s2">to civilization you&#39;ll understand where</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.019" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">we&#39;re headed and why I&#39;m so worried</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.820" end="00:24:31.999" style="s2">about it so I did land on my feet but</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:34.730" style="s2">one thing that is important for people</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.999" end="00:24:37.249" style="s2">who are considering their own jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.730" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">to realize is that there was not room in</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.249" end="00:24:41.690" style="s2">the outer world for an indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:44.929" style="s2">a large number of people to play my role</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.690" end="00:24:47.629" style="s2">so that is to say yes a small number of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.929" end="00:24:50.830" style="s2">people may make it out by maneuvering</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.629" end="00:24:52.669" style="s2">maneuvering deftly through the traps and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.830" end="00:24:54.500" style="s2">demonstrating that it is possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.669" end="00:24:57.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a hunger to see that people can</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.500" end="00:25:00.529" style="s2">accomplish that goal and while I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.019" end="00:25:03.049" style="s2">able to preserve my job or Heather&#39;s job</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.529" end="00:25:05.899" style="s2">I was able to carve out a niche in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.049" end="00:25:09.470" style="s2">outer world and I&#39;m doing fine I should</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.899" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">say what Heather and I have lost is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.470" end="00:25:15.049" style="s2">security that our jobs provided we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.970" style="s2">essentially none going forward one bad</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.049" end="00:25:20.769" style="s2">tweet and things could turn around on us</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.970" end="00:25:24.409" style="s2">but in terms of our quality of life we</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.769" end="00:25:26.600" style="s2">we are doing fine and did not we</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.409" end="00:25:28.850" style="s2">suffered briefly but then have recovered</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.600" end="00:25:31.700" style="s2">based on other things we were able to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.850" end="00:25:33.860" style="s2">that the world has some need for but if</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.700" end="00:25:36.019" style="s2">you look at the institution the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.860" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">institution has been utterly crippled by</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.019" end="00:25:40.549" style="s2">what happened the movement took over</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:44.750" style="s2">with the aid of the president because</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.549" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">the president partnered with the mob the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">college was reduced to a laughingstock</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:54.379" style="s2">the plans that were deployed were</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:56.509" style="s2">crippling to the college and the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.379" end="00:26:00.019" style="s2">reputation that came from</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.509" end="00:26:02.690" style="s2">obviously phony ideas becoming paramount</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.019" end="00:26:05.870" style="s2">at the school is one from which nobody</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.690" end="00:26:09.049" style="s2">thinks it will recover so if we now map</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.870" end="00:26:11.029" style="s2">this on to society we have a small</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.049" end="00:26:14.299" style="s2">number of us out here in society who are</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.029" end="00:26:17.299" style="s2">indeed able to make a living by talking</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.299" end="00:26:19.639" style="s2">about what&#39;s gone wrong and what to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.299" end="00:26:22.850" style="s2">think about it but you also have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.639" end="00:26:26.330" style="s2">movement that is advancing incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.850" end="00:26:29.029" style="s2">foolish policy proposals and you have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.330" end="00:26:30.950" style="s2">power structure that is cowing to it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.029" end="00:26:33.110" style="s2">what will be the result it will be just</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.950" end="00:26:34.309" style="s2">like evergreen and increasingly it seems</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.110" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">that the only people who can actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.309" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">speak freely are those outside the</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">institutions and I wanted to come to</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:45.139" style="s2">some we we were talking about before</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">which is on one level I mean both of us</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.139" end="00:26:47.990" style="s2">I think we watch this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:50.389" style="s2">happen and we&#39;ve got this kind of deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.990" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">visceral sense of we&#39;re losing these</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.389" end="00:26:54.690" style="s2">really powerful institutions or these in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:56.370" style="s2">to shion&#39;s are kind of dissolving in</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.690" end="00:26:58.740" style="s2">front of our faces but at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.370" end="00:27:01.259" style="s2">we&#39;ve both been able to make the leap</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.740" end="00:27:02.820" style="s2">into the independent media like in some</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.259" end="00:27:06.419" style="s2">ways this is a kind of really weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:08.009" style="s2">business opportunity to and to be able</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.419" end="00:27:10.980" style="s2">to kind of speak freely because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.009" end="00:27:14.639" style="s2">outside the institutions and it feels</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.980" end="00:27:16.200" style="s2">like a really like how do you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.639" end="00:27:17.700" style="s2">that because I guess you&#39;re watching all</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.200" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">of this stuff any energized by it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.700" end="00:27:21.570" style="s2">also feeling wow I&#39;ve got something new</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">to talk about on the podcast and people</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.570" end="00:27:26.669" style="s2">are going to love it so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:30.179" style="s2">balance those two things yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.669" end="00:27:31.710" style="s2">complicated I mean I I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.179" end="00:27:33.029" style="s2">fortunate and I still have a foot in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.710" end="00:27:35.249" style="s2">mainstream media and that you know I</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.029" end="00:27:36.779" style="s2">have a book coming out I was lucky to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.249" end="00:27:38.490" style="s2">like be able to sign on with a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.779" end="00:27:42.330" style="s2">publisher it&#39;ll be out in April the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.490" end="00:27:45.480" style="s2">quickfix please buy it quick fix is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:47.159" style="s2">name I&#39;m torn on this in a lot of ways I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.480" end="00:27:48.749" style="s2">think Katy and I would both rather have</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.159" end="00:27:51.269" style="s2">it be the case that journalism is</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.749" end="00:27:53.129" style="s2">healthy and thriving and people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.269" end="00:27:54.749" style="s2">I&#39;ve throw money at two assholes on a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.129" end="00:27:57.720" style="s2">podcast talking about internet nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.749" end="00:27:59.730" style="s2">but because mainstream media is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.720" end="00:28:02.220" style="s2">increasingly unable to have normal</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">conversations being had by people all</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.220" end="00:28:07.619" style="s2">over the country will jump in will seize</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:09.450" style="s2">that opportunity and we&#39;ve been so</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.619" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">gratified at the success so far and</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.450" end="00:28:14.519" style="s2">genuinely shocked at how quickly this</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:18.059" style="s2">has become this now supports us more</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.519" end="00:28:19.649" style="s2">than supports us people should maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.059" end="00:28:22.499" style="s2">take some lessons from that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.649" end="00:28:24.119" style="s2">the outlets like The Times and other</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.499" end="00:28:25.710" style="s2">main mainstream outlets that would never</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.119" end="00:28:28.440" style="s2">ever hosts a podcast like this should</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.710" end="00:28:30.169" style="s2">should perhaps consider the money and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.440" end="00:28:32.549" style="s2">the viewers they&#39;re leaving on the table</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.169" end="00:28:34.049" style="s2">most likely outcome is that journalism&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.549" end="00:28:35.580" style="s2">are going to continue to collapse and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.049" end="00:28:39.509" style="s2">the next round of funding or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.580" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">will I think be toward efforts more like</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.509" end="00:28:44.279" style="s2">ours I would rather a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:45.600" style="s2">ProPublica sprout I&#39;d rather have there</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.279" end="00:28:48.210" style="s2">be investigative journal I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.600" end="00:28:49.799" style="s2">there&#39;s like a if the Columbus Ohio</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.210" end="00:28:51.059" style="s2">Police Department hasn&#39;t made your</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.799" end="00:28:52.379" style="s2">scandal who the hell is gonna cover that</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.059" end="00:28:54.450" style="s2">that&#39;s much more important than what</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.379" end="00:28:56.759" style="s2">Katie and I do and and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.450" end="00:28:58.499" style="s2">worried about is that you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.759" end="00:29:00.269" style="s2">a year from now there&#39;s ten blocked and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.499" end="00:29:01.830" style="s2">reported twenty more people can make a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.269" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">living doing that kind of commentary and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.830" end="00:29:05.100" style="s2">and making fun of the demise of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:06.179" style="s2">progressive journalism well being</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.100" end="00:29:09.360" style="s2">progressive themselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.179" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">I just that&#39;s not as important as actual</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:12.360" style="s2">journalism in reporting so in that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">sounds like it whatever qualms I have</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.360" end="00:29:15.179" style="s2">with The Times they still do really good</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">investigative stuff they still have some</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.179" end="00:29:17.610" style="s2">of the most talented reporters in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:18.779" style="s2">country same with the Washington Post</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.610" end="00:29:21.029" style="s2">same with other outlets where</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.779" end="00:29:23.639" style="s2">increasingly can&#39;t read their culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.029" end="00:29:25.830" style="s2">coverage because it&#39;s just I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.639" end="00:29:28.980" style="s2">read the Wesleyan student paper if I</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.830" end="00:29:30.690" style="s2">want those takes so I don&#39;t want these</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.980" end="00:29:33.450" style="s2">outlets to collapse I want in a sense I</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.690" end="00:29:36.840" style="s2">want them to thrive I mean just fun</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.450" end="00:29:39.990" style="s2">journalism it&#39;s a weird situation</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.840" end="00:29:41.639" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want my entire life to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.990" end="00:29:44.700" style="s2">covering and talking about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.639" end="00:29:46.860" style="s2">because it&#39;s exhausting and yeah I&#39;m</p>
