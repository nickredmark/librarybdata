<p begin="00:05:08.919" end="00:05:11.740" style="s2">that you had learned from but how did</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.539" end="00:05:13.569" style="s2">that shape you you know you&#39;re this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.740" end="00:05:16.150" style="s2">young kid you&#39;re in an environment in</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.569" end="00:05:17.710" style="s2">Iowa there&#39;s meditation going on how did</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.150" end="00:05:19.569" style="s2">you pull from that and what did that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.710" end="00:05:22.599" style="s2">mean to what you do now well I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.569" end="00:05:25.000" style="s2">one of the big unique fortunate things</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.599" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">about bringing for me was I was mostly</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.000" end="00:05:30.310" style="s2">homeschooled and I happened to be in one</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:31.509" style="s2">meditation community but was in a number</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.310" end="00:05:34.259" style="s2">of different alternative communities</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.509" end="00:05:37.750" style="s2">that focused on personal development</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.259" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">activism different forms and fields of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.750" end="00:05:41.949" style="s2">science permaculture right my parents</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:43.990" style="s2">were interested in evolutionary topics</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.949" end="00:05:45.699" style="s2">and so we got to live in proximity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.990" end="00:05:47.380" style="s2">different cool thinkers and evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.699" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">topics but the benefit of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.380" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">homeschooling was my parents were</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:53.349" style="s2">wanting to do an experiment the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:55.810" style="s2">educational experiment which was before</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.349" end="00:05:57.460" style="s2">unschooling was the thing the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.810" end="00:06:00.190" style="s2">let&#39;s give them no fixed curriculum at</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.460" end="00:06:01.389" style="s2">all and expose them to as many things as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.190" end="00:06:03.250" style="s2">possible see what their interests are</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.389" end="00:06:06.250" style="s2">and facilitate that and so this was my</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.250" end="00:06:08.469" style="s2">education growing up so I never had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.250" end="00:06:12.070" style="s2">fixed amount of spelling or handwriting</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.469" end="00:06:14.259" style="s2">or you know social studies or so my</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.070" end="00:06:16.630" style="s2">spelling still depends on spell checker</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.259" end="00:06:17.889" style="s2">completely my handwriting depends upon</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.630" end="00:06:19.330" style="s2">the fact that only used computers</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.889" end="00:06:21.190" style="s2">because I you know I never developed</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.330" end="00:06:24.009" style="s2">those things but I did get to dive into</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:25.449" style="s2">the sciences very deeply very early in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.009" end="00:06:27.340" style="s2">way that was untraditional that is a way</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.449" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">that would would be the case for any kid</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.340" end="00:06:32.289" style="s2">if they were facilitated to follow what</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:34.539" style="s2">they were really interested in and so my</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.289" end="00:06:36.550" style="s2">early upbringing was all of the sciences</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.539" end="00:06:38.979" style="s2">all of the different philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.550" end="00:06:40.330" style="s2">traditions and all areas of activism but</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.979" end="00:06:42.819" style="s2">one of the other really neat things was</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.330" end="00:06:46.060" style="s2">because I didn&#39;t learn them in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.819" end="00:06:48.190" style="s2">contexts of subjects right this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.060" end="00:06:50.110" style="s2">social science this is biology this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.190" end="00:06:52.150" style="s2">physics I didn&#39;t even think of them in</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.110" end="00:06:54.750" style="s2">isolated way so I&#39;d be cross applying</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.150" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">principles from thermodynamics to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.750" end="00:06:59.349" style="s2">astrophysics to cell biology to looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:01.389" style="s2">at what is true about how reality works</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.349" end="00:07:03.070" style="s2">across all of these because I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.389" end="00:07:04.089" style="s2">think of them in segmented ways and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.070" end="00:07:05.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t think of them in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.089" end="00:07:07.389" style="s2">discrete laws of a domain</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.740" end="00:07:09.400" style="s2">what age were you when you started to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.389" end="00:07:10.750" style="s2">fascinated about systems and about how</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.400" end="00:07:12.099" style="s2">things work I mean because is there a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.750" end="00:07:14.380" style="s2">time we remember like I know when I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.099" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">a kid I took a part of telephone and my</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.380" end="00:07:18.069" style="s2">curiosity I have this insatiable</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:19.900" style="s2">curiosity and I always wondered how</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.069" end="00:07:21.130" style="s2">things work so I wasn&#39;t satisfied unless</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.900" end="00:07:22.990" style="s2">I took it apart and put it back together</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.130" end="00:07:24.849" style="s2">did you feel like that in your life I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.990" end="00:07:27.220" style="s2">mean how has that serves you I do how</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.849" end="00:07:28.660" style="s2">would you describe your curiosity the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.220" end="00:07:31.060" style="s2">same as yours I&#39;m the same as any other</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.660" end="00:07:34.449" style="s2">kids I maybe just had more facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.060" end="00:07:35.860" style="s2">so it happens with kids usually is they</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.449" end="00:07:37.449" style="s2">want to take apart the telephone they</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.860" end="00:07:38.860" style="s2">want to make lasers they want to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.449" end="00:07:41.650" style="s2">know do all kinds of interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.860" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">boys and particularly those ones but all</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.650" end="00:07:46.180" style="s2">genders whatever they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:48.069" style="s2">is gonna be very deep but but also</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.180" end="00:07:50.229" style="s2">things that are more esoteric like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.069" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">never met a little kid who at 2 3 4</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.229" end="00:07:54.340" style="s2">years old doesn&#39;t ask questions like why</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:55.810" style="s2">is the sky blue and we give them</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.340" end="00:07:59.050" style="s2">nonsense answers but to actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.810" end="00:08:00.310" style="s2">understand how the atmosphere works and</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.050" end="00:08:01.780" style="s2">how diffraction works and how light</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.310" end="00:08:02.919" style="s2">works and how that intersects with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.780" end="00:08:04.509" style="s2">way the rods and the cones and our eye</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.919" end="00:08:07.360" style="s2">work and what the subjective experience</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.509" end="00:08:09.849" style="s2">of blue compared to the actual objective</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.360" end="00:08:10.990" style="s2">experience of light scattering it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.849" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">actually one of the deepest most</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:14.530" style="s2">profound things to answer that well that</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:17.949" style="s2">exposes them to everything from the hard</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.530" end="00:08:19.030" style="s2">problem of neuroscience to atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.949" end="00:08:20.979" style="s2">sciences and where they&#39;re gonna learn</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.030" end="00:08:22.930" style="s2">about climate change and stellar</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.979" end="00:08:24.639" style="s2">formation and physics they ask why is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.930" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">fire hot it&#39;s the same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.639" end="00:08:29.560" style="s2">right like well we can talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:30.849" style="s2">the photon releasing is and how photons</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.560" end="00:08:32.620" style="s2">are exchanging energy in the hand but</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.849" end="00:08:34.779" style="s2">then why are my subjectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.620" end="00:08:37.659" style="s2">experiencing it as hot and so what</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.779" end="00:08:39.909" style="s2">happens is we just don&#39;t know so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.659" end="00:08:41.529" style="s2">don&#39;t answer their questions well and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.909" end="00:08:43.089" style="s2">instead steer them to things that we do</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.529" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">know that are really not interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.089" end="00:08:45.940" style="s2">like how to spell something or what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">capital is something that is and we turn</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.940" end="00:08:49.029" style="s2">them off to schooling we turn them off</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:51.550" style="s2">to learning turn them off to their</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.029" end="00:08:54.250" style="s2">innate fascination of existing so when</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.550" end="00:08:55.899" style="s2">we look at the whole issue of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.250" end="00:08:57.399" style="s2">of welfare model dynamic where we think</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.899" end="00:08:58.870" style="s2">if people are not capitalistic aliy</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.399" end="00:09:02.860" style="s2">motivated they&#39;ll just watch TV all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.870" end="00:09:04.120" style="s2">time kids are so intrinsically motivated</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.860" end="00:09:05.829" style="s2">to learn everything they can and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.120" end="00:09:07.329" style="s2">build stuff and to create and to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.829" end="00:09:09.399" style="s2">want to go to work with mom or dad and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.329" end="00:09:11.589" style="s2">figure out how to do stuff what happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.399" end="00:09:13.690" style="s2">is when we don&#39;t facilitate their</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.589" end="00:09:14.860" style="s2">interests and then we actively force</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.690" end="00:09:16.150" style="s2">them to be interested in that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.860" end="00:09:17.560" style="s2">just not interesting to them because</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.150" end="00:09:18.270" style="s2">there&#39;s more to do with memorization and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.560" end="00:09:20.670" style="s2">getting it right than</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.270" end="00:09:22.950" style="s2">understanding mechanics in or dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.670" end="00:09:24.810" style="s2">and interesting ways we break their</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.950" end="00:09:27.810" style="s2">innate intrinsic interest in life and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.810" end="00:09:29.190" style="s2">make them deferring to extrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.810" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">Authority and then they just want to get</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.190" end="00:09:33.570" style="s2">away from that which ends up looking</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:35.580" style="s2">like play chill out is some form of you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.570" end="00:09:37.710" style="s2">know escape from broken interest in life</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.580" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">so the future of Education has the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.710" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">ability to have polymath be the new</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:52.710" style="s2">the the way that I hear you explain</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.850" end="00:09:54.660" style="s2">things this is something that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.710" end="00:09:55.980" style="s2">endogenous to you I mean do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.660" end="00:09:58.350" style="s2">like your intelligence has blossomed</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.980" end="00:09:59.850" style="s2">from that environment how did you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.350" end="00:10:01.710" style="s2">through these stages of learning without</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.850" end="00:10:03.090" style="s2">going to this traditional schooling and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.710" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">then maybe tell us a little bit about</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.730" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">that I was struck by early is I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.190" end="00:10:17.880" style="s2">studying very fortunate to come across</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.690" style="s2">the work of buck mr. fuller early in</p>

<p begin="00:11:13.260" end="00:11:17.340" style="s2">he had slightly below average</p>

<p begin="00:11:17.340" end="00:11:21.180" style="s2">intelligence that the other kids in</p>

<p begin="00:11:23.370" end="00:11:28.890" style="s2">happen some specific experiences where</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.270" style="s2">he became interested in figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.890" end="00:11:31.379" style="s2">what could a person of normal</p>

<p begin="00:11:38.879" end="00:11:43.109" style="s2">insight like that early on but you see</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.859" end="00:11:45.749" style="s2">then all that he developed as someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.109" end="00:11:47.999" style="s2">who he would say he was utterly</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.749" end="00:11:49.799" style="s2">convinced he had no endogenous no</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.999" end="00:11:51.569" style="s2">capacities that were beyond normal but a</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.799" end="00:11:53.039" style="s2">development process one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.569" end="00:11:54.839" style="s2">that&#39;s so interesting for me then was</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.039" end="00:11:57.419" style="s2">all the people who developed themselves</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.839" end="00:11:58.829" style="s2">to the kind of highest degrees of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.419" end="00:12:02.189" style="s2">comprehensive development said things</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.829" end="00:12:06.569" style="s2">very similar and so it&#39;s clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.189" end="00:12:09.209" style="s2">that and you know then we&#39;ve no very</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.569" end="00:12:11.069" style="s2">deeply into all of the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.209" end="00:12:15.329" style="s2">biology of the topics and educational</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.069" end="00:12:16.829" style="s2">theory that the highest stages of human</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.829" end="00:12:20.699" style="s2">that seems so many standard deviations</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.659" end="00:12:22.259" style="s2">beyond normal can be the new baseline</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:23.970" style="s2">what was the stage where you went</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.259" end="00:12:25.829" style="s2">through where you realized a that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.970" end="00:12:26.999" style="s2">had something that was neurodegenerative</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.829" end="00:12:28.829" style="s2">I think a lot of people deal with</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.999" end="00:12:30.419" style="s2">illness I know I had a lot of health</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.829" end="00:12:32.579" style="s2">issues when I was in my 20s and in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.419" end="00:12:34.529" style="s2">30s and was there a point where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.579" end="00:12:36.509" style="s2">realized eh I have something that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.529" end="00:12:37.829" style="s2">not exactly sure how to fix and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.509" end="00:12:43.259" style="s2">what did that road look like for you to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.829" end="00:12:46.609" style="s2">heal so I was in undergraduate I was 18</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.259" end="00:12:49.079" style="s2">I was rock climbing weightlifting</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.609" end="00:12:52.679" style="s2">healthy and then had symptoms start</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.079" end="00:12:54.869" style="s2">kicking on very rapidly that were kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.679" end="00:12:57.119" style="s2">of neuromuscular joint type things did</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.869" end="00:12:58.979" style="s2">not have a background in by our health</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.119" end="00:13:02.850" style="s2">at that point was studying math and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.979" end="00:13:04.439" style="s2">physics and other topics and so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.850" end="00:13:06.269" style="s2">started studying seeing all of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.439" end="00:13:07.589" style="s2">doctors and Integrative doctors and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.269" end="00:13:09.089" style="s2">various kind of modalities they could</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.589" end="00:13:11.039" style="s2">and ended up figuring out a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.089" end="00:13:13.559" style="s2">underlying phenomena from inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.039" end="00:13:15.989" style="s2">conditions and the underlying causes in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.559" end="00:13:17.729" style="s2">terms of toxicity and pathogenicity and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.989" end="00:13:19.619" style="s2">things were more causing it for myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.729" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">and end up reversing it fairly quickly</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.619" end="00:13:23.549" style="s2">what was the time period where it</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:27.329" style="s2">reversed three months Wow three months</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.549" end="00:13:29.459" style="s2">and the initial diagnosis was rheumatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.329" end="00:13:30.749" style="s2">autoimmune disorder it doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.459" end="00:13:32.489" style="s2">cure</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.749" end="00:13:34.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t traditionally have a cure so</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.489" end="00:13:37.679" style="s2">that was very neat and then I was you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.589" end="00:13:39.630" style="s2">know free of symptom pathology for for</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.679" end="00:13:44.370" style="s2">many years until</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.630" end="00:13:46.650" style="s2">mmm 30 something and again very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.370" end="00:13:47.640" style="s2">had an onset of something and it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.650" end="00:13:49.560" style="s2">probably the same underlying</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.640" end="00:13:51.150" style="s2">susceptibilities they hadn&#39;t been fully</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.560" end="00:13:53.310" style="s2">addressed previously they got read</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.150" end="00:13:55.320" style="s2">triggered by some new phenomena and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.310" end="00:13:57.330" style="s2">it was a much more aggressive onset with</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.320" end="00:13:59.430" style="s2">more complexity involved and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.330" end="00:14:03.090" style="s2">required me doing a much deeper dive</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.430" end="00:14:05.460" style="s2">into modeling it know that this was</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.090" end="00:14:09.150" style="s2">important so we look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.460" end="00:14:10.530" style="s2">MS or rheumatoid arthritis or ALS or any</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.150" end="00:14:12.660" style="s2">any kind of complex disease or</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.530" end="00:14:14.130" style="s2">psychiatric issues ER but say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.660" end="00:14:17.010" style="s2">looking at so we&#39;re looking at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.130" end="00:14:19.890" style="s2">rheumatic condition we will see</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.010" end="00:14:21.690" style="s2">correlation between that romantic</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.890" end="00:14:23.610" style="s2">conditions statistically significant</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.690" end="00:14:25.290" style="s2">correlation and things like a particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:26.670" style="s2">kind of toxin exposure whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.290" end="00:14:28.200" style="s2">heavy metal or whether it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.670" end="00:14:30.360" style="s2">organophosphate or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.200" end="00:14:31.830" style="s2">we don&#39;t see one for one it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.360" end="00:14:33.210" style="s2">everyone who has it has had that</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.830" end="00:14:35.190" style="s2">exposure or everybody&#39;s had that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.210" end="00:14:36.750" style="s2">exposure has that disease but we see</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.190" end="00:14:38.430" style="s2">statistically meaningful correlation</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.750" end="00:14:39.690" style="s2">will see statistically meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.430" end="00:14:42.770" style="s2">correlation with a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.690" end="00:14:45.960" style="s2">forms of U of subclinical infections of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.770" end="00:14:48.900" style="s2">Lyme disease of exposure to mold</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.960" end="00:14:51.420" style="s2">biotoxins of gastrointestinal pathogens</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.900" end="00:14:52.890" style="s2">of you know but this ends up being very</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.420" end="00:14:56.160" style="s2">hard the traditional medical model is</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.890" end="00:14:59.460" style="s2">looking for one disease primarily having</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.160" end="00:15:00.960" style="s2">one pathway that is primarily causing it</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.460" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">and then it&#39;s going to have one chemical</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.960" end="00:15:06.960" style="s2">that addresses that pathway but for our</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">current medical approach is good for</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.960" end="00:15:12.210" style="s2">acute cause issues so this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.020" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">so great for emergency medicine because</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.210" end="00:15:15.930" style="s2">the cause is actually pretty acute it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:17.940" style="s2">pretty clear and you can address it but</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.930" end="00:15:19.620" style="s2">where you have chronic diseases that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.940" end="00:15:21.210" style="s2">developed over some period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.620" end="00:15:22.380" style="s2">often times were multifactorial they</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.210" end="00:15:24.300" style="s2">don&#39;t have one causes they have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.380" end="00:15:25.980" style="s2">different causes it&#39;s not even the same</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.300" end="00:15:28.890" style="s2">multiple set for different people and</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.980" end="00:15:30.180" style="s2">there was delayed causation in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.890" end="00:15:31.250" style="s2">when the first thing happened and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.180" end="00:15:33.480" style="s2">have some underlying pathophysiology</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.250" end="00:15:35.460" style="s2">happening before symptomology occurs</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.480" end="00:15:38.070" style="s2">it&#39;s actually really tricky to figure</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.460" end="00:15:39.960" style="s2">out how that works and you don&#39;t treat a</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.070" end="00:15:41.570" style="s2">cluster of symptoms called a disease you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.960" end="00:15:43.890" style="s2">actually have to see what is going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.570" end="00:15:46.470" style="s2">specific pathway wise for that person</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.890" end="00:15:48.030" style="s2">can be able to address that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.470" end="00:15:49.620" style="s2">future of personalized medicine you feel</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.030" end="00:15:51.060" style="s2">like you were really supporting all the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.620" end="00:15:52.860" style="s2">systems underneath so that they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.060" end="00:15:53.550" style="s2">happening in synergy what did you do</p>

<p begin="00:15:53.550" end="00:15:56.190" style="s2">and then how did the different</p>

<p begin="00:16:00.420" end="00:16:04.050" style="s2">obviously as someone who&#39;s interested in</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.020" end="00:16:28.260" style="s2">hardware that learning operates on so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.820" end="00:16:31.050" style="s2">had worked with nootropics in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.260" end="00:16:32.580" style="s2">chemistry but not as deeply or</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.050" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">sophisticatedly cos there wasn&#39;t an Eden</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.580" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">right oftentimes in evolutionary need</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:38.820" style="s2">ended up driving but when those</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:42.390" style="s2">illnesses first kicked on in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.820" end="00:16:44.130" style="s2">having like a lot of neuromuscular</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.390" end="00:16:46.050" style="s2">symptoms II there was cognitive symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.130" end="00:16:47.730" style="s2">all G was that massive brain fog you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.050" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">going through what was it yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.730" end="00:16:51.690" style="s2">decreased cognitive capability how many</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:54.030" style="s2">hours per day I had that were</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.690" end="00:16:56.460" style="s2">cognitively viable and potency of</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.030" end="00:16:58.410" style="s2">cognitive capability and for me for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.460" end="00:16:59.820" style="s2">things I was interested in that was much</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.410" end="00:17:01.230" style="s2">more debilitating than physical debility</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.820" end="00:17:03.240" style="s2">because at that time you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.230" end="00:17:05.040" style="s2">high-level thinking so you had to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.240" end="00:17:06.780" style="s2">cognitively capable it wasn&#39;t an option</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.040" end="00:17:08.730" style="s2">and all the things that I really care</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.780" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">about affecting require solving hard</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.730" end="00:17:13.140" style="s2">problems right and so my focus was all</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:15.150" style="s2">right well if I&#39;m gonna work on figuring</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.140" end="00:17:17.010" style="s2">out these kind of underlying disease</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.150" end="00:17:18.450" style="s2">structures so that I can get well to get</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.010" end="00:17:19.770" style="s2">back to my focus on the future of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.450" end="00:17:21.150" style="s2">macroeconomics and governance and</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.770" end="00:17:22.940" style="s2">infrastructure and kind of large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.150" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">environmental and humanitarian things</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.940" end="00:17:26.700" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna need a lot of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.140" style="s2">bandwidth but figure these medical</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.700" end="00:17:29.730" style="s2">issues out so first I&#39;m gonna focus on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.140" end="00:17:31.140" style="s2">how to increase my cognitive bandwidth</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.730" end="00:17:33.570" style="s2">so I can apply the limited amount that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.140" end="00:17:35.850" style="s2">have to regulate it you know that was my</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.570" end="00:17:38.310" style="s2">leverage in and so that was a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.850" end="00:17:39.750" style="s2">dive in cognitive chemistry and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.310" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">looked like everything in the nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.750" end="00:17:46.290" style="s2">space the brain nutrient space the both</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:49.310" style="s2">kind of neural chemistry and neuro</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.400" end="00:17:57.000" style="s2">various aspects of cognition so short</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.830" style="s2">where this is being mediated by</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.830" end="00:18:10.669" style="s2">acetylcholine glutamate dopamine etc</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:12.620" style="s2">with the different pathways</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.669" end="00:18:14.899" style="s2">you literally mapped out everything that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.620" end="00:18:16.760" style="s2">cascades into one another and understood</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.899" end="00:18:18.710" style="s2">how all these systems work for cognition</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.760" end="00:18:20.779" style="s2">well I most certainly did not map out</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.710" end="00:18:23.029" style="s2">how it actually works because I was</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.779" end="00:18:26.389" style="s2">looking at that you know let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.029" end="00:18:28.429" style="s2">looked at a few hundred pathways and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.389" end="00:18:31.250" style="s2">interactions but I&#39;ve got something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.429" end="00:18:33.080" style="s2">10 to the 45 actual elements of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.250" end="00:18:34.429" style="s2">complexity involved what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.080" end="00:18:36.049" style="s2">still reductionistic just less</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.429" end="00:18:38.419" style="s2">reductionistic I&#39;m not looking at single</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.049" end="00:18:40.940" style="s2">molecule solutions and especially not</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.419" end="00:18:43.220" style="s2">single molecule that are just overriding</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.940" end="00:18:44.690" style="s2">an endogenous regulatory pathway by</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.220" end="00:18:46.309" style="s2">providing the engine chemical but</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:48.169" style="s2">looking at what is everything we know</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.309" end="00:18:49.909" style="s2">from the various disciplines about how</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.169" end="00:18:52.580" style="s2">those endogenous regulatory systems work</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.909" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">and where breakdown in those systems can</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.580" end="00:18:55.940" style="s2">happen and then how to be able to assess</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.950" style="s2">what&#39;s going on and then support it in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.940" end="00:19:00.409" style="s2">customized fashion so I started with</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.950" end="00:19:02.210" style="s2">cognitive chemistry to have a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.409" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">clarity to continue work with a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.210" end="00:19:05.539" style="s2">neural chemistry right there&#39;s that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.340" style="s2">knew that was not an adequate solution</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.539" end="00:19:09.289" style="s2">but it was a necessary partial solution</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.340" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">which ends up being directly relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.289" end="00:19:13.100" style="s2">why this company exists and this company</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:15.470" style="s2">is something that&#39;s deeply impacted me I</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.100" end="00:19:17.149" style="s2">had six weeks of trying the product</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.470" end="00:19:18.380" style="s2">we&#39;re in talk about qualia and for</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.149" end="00:19:20.809" style="s2">people that don&#39;t know before I tell my</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.380" end="00:19:22.610" style="s2">story what our nootropics I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.809" end="00:19:24.440" style="s2">a buzz out there the wellness industry</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.610" end="00:19:25.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like one of the top seven trends or</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.440" end="00:19:27.289" style="s2">ten trends right now for people that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.730" end="00:19:28.970" style="s2">want to optimize the way they show up in</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.289" end="00:19:30.649" style="s2">their life but if somebody hasn&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.970" end="00:19:33.769" style="s2">of nootropics I mean what is a nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.649" end="00:19:37.690" style="s2">so the work no tropic is not precisely</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.769" end="00:19:40.429" style="s2">defined in a way that everyone uses it</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.690" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">commonly but for the most part we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.429" end="00:19:45.200" style="s2">define nootropic as some chemical that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.039" end="00:19:47.690" style="s2">enhances some aspect of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.200" end="00:19:50.570" style="s2">ability beyond normal baseline without</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.690" end="00:19:52.309" style="s2">meaningful side-effects and so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.570" end="00:19:53.659" style="s2">if we&#39;re dealing with someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.309" end="00:19:55.130" style="s2">cognitive capability having dropped</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.659" end="00:19:56.630" style="s2">below baseline we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.130" end="00:19:58.820" style="s2">pathology of some kind even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.630" end="00:20:00.830" style="s2">subclinical pathology right Alzheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.820" end="00:20:05.240" style="s2">is cognitive decline from pathology that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.830" end="00:20:06.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve defined very clearly brain fog is</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.240" end="00:20:08.360" style="s2">generally not a clearly defined</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.380" end="00:20:10.549" style="s2">pathology but it is actually dysfunction</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.360" end="00:20:11.750" style="s2">so if we are correcting the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.549" end="00:20:13.370" style="s2">dysfunction to just come back to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.750" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">baseline that&#39;s very meaningful we would</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.370" end="00:20:16.890" style="s2">call that kind of medicine in the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">neuropharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.890" end="00:20:19.799" style="s2">in the you know cognitive chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:21.690" style="s2">space and it&#39;s not medicine that&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.799" end="00:20:23.220" style="s2">understood or well defined but that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.690" end="00:20:24.570" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be no tropics per se even</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.220" end="00:20:25.830" style="s2">though a lot of people use no tropics</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.570" end="00:20:27.710" style="s2">for that space</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.830" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">no tropics are really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.710" end="00:20:33.090" style="s2">optimization beyond baseline how can I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:35.549" style="s2">take some capacity and enhance it now</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.090" end="00:20:37.290" style="s2">then you have smart drugs so people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.549" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">use adderall not for prescription</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.290" end="00:20:40.950" style="s2">purposes for an actual diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.390" style="s2">function but are using it for</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.950" end="00:20:44.340" style="s2">enhancement and will enhance something</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.390" end="00:20:46.290" style="s2">whether it&#39;s adderall that they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.340" end="00:20:48.690" style="s2">or Ritalin or modafinil what will be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.290" end="00:20:50.309" style="s2">trend or just lots of Red Bull Red Bulls</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.690" end="00:20:52.470" style="s2">a smart drug you could you could think</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.309" end="00:20:53.940" style="s2">that way right most of the time when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.470" end="00:20:56.160" style="s2">think smart drug we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.940" end="00:20:58.290" style="s2">pharmaceuticals some pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.160" end="00:21:01.230" style="s2">that&#39;s usually for narcolepsy or a DD or</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.290" end="00:21:03.179" style="s2">some other kind of actual cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.230" end="00:21:05.970" style="s2">decline disorder like Alzheimer&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.179" end="00:21:07.410" style="s2">Parkinson&#39;s people use levodopa right as</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.970" end="00:21:08.929" style="s2">Parkinson&#39;s meant for increasing</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.410" end="00:21:11.630" style="s2">dopamine do different things like that</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.929" end="00:21:14.490" style="s2">so we usually think of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.630" end="00:21:16.590" style="s2">Pharma med first that is being used for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.490" end="00:21:18.840" style="s2">an off-label purpose for enhancing some</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.590" end="00:21:22.770" style="s2">aspect of cognitive function and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.840" end="00:21:25.770" style="s2">does work but usually it works at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.770" end="00:21:27.390" style="s2">cost of both long-term dependency</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.770" end="00:21:29.850" style="s2">long-term side effects and usually even</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.390" end="00:21:32.280" style="s2">fairly narrow up regulation with some</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.850" end="00:21:34.080" style="s2">real-time down regulation so when people</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.280" end="00:21:35.700" style="s2">are taking dopamine for instance they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.080" end="00:21:38.160" style="s2">seeking to increase dopamine production</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.700" end="00:21:39.540" style="s2">but they&#39;re not looking at how natural</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.160" end="00:21:42.030" style="s2">dopamine production and dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.540" end="00:21:44.190" style="s2">regulation works and so we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.030" end="00:21:45.630" style="s2">dopamine relatively fixed from outside</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.190" end="00:21:48.299" style="s2">stimulus we want to open to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.630" end="00:21:50.040" style="s2">be adaptive to external stimulus as is</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.419" end="00:21:58.770" style="s2">catecholamines right and we also want to</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:01.380" style="s2">look at the whole chain of how dopa</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.770" end="00:22:04.380" style="s2">dopamine is produced to say if that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.380" end="00:22:07.970" style="s2">chain is damaged somewhere right the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.380" end="00:22:10.590" style="s2">person is not getting enough tyrosine or</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.970" end="00:22:12.179" style="s2">phenyl alanine or they don&#39;t have enough</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.179" end="00:22:16.740" style="s2">converting it b6 or C or etc and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.910" end="00:22:18.330" style="s2">can affect other things so dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.740" end="00:22:19.260" style="s2">might be the most obvious but if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.330" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">tyrosine issue it might be affecting</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.260" end="00:22:24.360" style="s2">thyroid function a so not only do we not</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:27.570" style="s2">want to just go straight to the insane</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.360" end="00:22:30.040" style="s2">chemical and make them not adaptive but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.570" end="00:22:31.510" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to lose the opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.100" end="00:24:13.300" style="s2">great supply and it was incredible I</p>

<p begin="00:24:15.490" end="00:24:18.490" style="s2">that I woke up in the morning I did my</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:21.490" style="s2">meditation I went through my normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.490" end="00:24:23.770" style="s2">process and then I&#39;m at CES eight</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.490" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">podcast interviews in one day and going</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.770" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">on stage to moderate a panel and an</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.220" end="00:24:31.030" style="s2">was still thinking like wow I could</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.230" end="00:24:33.010" style="s2">actually connect with more people and</p>

<p begin="00:24:46.750" end="00:24:50.560" style="s2">mean what is that product</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.760" end="00:24:52.210" style="s2">tell us about qualia tell us what I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.560" end="00:24:54.250" style="s2">using to be able to have that incredible</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.210" end="00:24:57.460" style="s2">day so the first thing that we looked at</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.250" end="00:25:00.100" style="s2">was you know as we were saying we see</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.460" end="00:25:02.590" style="s2">this exponential rise in products that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.100" end="00:25:05.020" style="s2">people are taking to enhance some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.590" end="00:25:08.140" style="s2">of productive capability or focus or</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.020" end="00:25:09.910" style="s2">energy or clarity even if it is down</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.140" end="00:25:11.230" style="s2">regulating other things that matter even</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.910" end="00:25:12.070" style="s2">if it&#39;s causing dependence because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.230" end="00:25:14.140" style="s2">demand is so high</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.070" end="00:25:15.370" style="s2">alright the need is so high so as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.140" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">mentioning with your brother and so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.370" end="00:25:19.240" style="s2">people there are more things causing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:20.860" style="s2">distraction and competing for focus</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.240" end="00:25:23.950" style="s2">while an increased demand for</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.860" end="00:25:26.740" style="s2">productivity and the net result of those</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.950" end="00:25:29.740" style="s2">together is very stressful debilitating</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.740" end="00:25:32.080" style="s2">cetera so most people know if they take</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.740" end="00:25:34.240" style="s2">caffeine they can have increase in</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.080" end="00:25:35.650" style="s2">certain kinds of focus but if they take</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.240" end="00:25:38.800" style="s2">it above a certain level they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.650" end="00:25:40.540" style="s2">get then downsides anxiety jitters and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.800" end="00:25:42.070" style="s2">they still if they actually pay</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.540" end="00:25:43.960" style="s2">attention and say they use quantified</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.070" end="00:25:45.460" style="s2">mind or Cambridge online cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.960" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">assessment or tools like that quantified</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.460" end="00:25:50.650" style="s2">self tools they&#39;ll see that some metrics</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:53.650" style="s2">of cognitive capability increase and</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.650" end="00:25:55.960" style="s2">other ones actually decrease in real</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.650" end="00:25:57.490" style="s2">time right so we&#39;ve seen times where</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.960" end="00:25:59.020" style="s2">people have a lot more energy but</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.490" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">they&#39;re actually task switching so fast</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.020" end="00:26:02.860" style="s2">their follow through sport or things</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:04.180" style="s2">like that right so the first thing we</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.860" end="00:26:07.450" style="s2">did was we said all right so people who</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.180" end="00:26:08.920" style="s2">are buying off-label adderall or smart</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.450" end="00:26:10.900" style="s2">drinks or whatever it is are they</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.920" end="00:26:12.430" style="s2">actually really looking for and what</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.900" end="00:26:16.060" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for most of the time is</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.430" end="00:26:18.430" style="s2">not just increased arithmetic processing</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.060" end="00:26:20.610" style="s2">or increased verbal fluency or increased</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.430" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">digit span but they&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.610" end="00:26:24.970" style="s2">creative productive flow states where</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.770" end="00:26:30.060" style="s2">they have the right emotional state that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.690" end="00:26:31.960" style="s2">goes along with them so</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.060" end="00:26:33.880" style="s2">cognitively there&#39;s a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.960" end="00:26:36.780" style="s2">functions its short-term memory and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.880" end="00:26:39.340" style="s2">long-term memory and speed of memory and</p>

<p begin="00:26:45.390" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">cognitive metrics but it&#39;s the product</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.830" end="00:26:51.670" style="s2">of those together right none of them on</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:52.630" style="s2">their own and we actually really want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.670" end="00:26:53.620" style="s2">look at how do we lift all those</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.630" end="00:26:56.220" style="s2">together oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.620" end="00:26:58.840" style="s2">along with more internal drive and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.220" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">internal agency and more emotional</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.030" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">together in synergy if we have time in</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.340" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">the other show we&#39;ll talk about how is</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:31.059" style="s2">the most about qualia is that I could go</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.780" end="00:27:32.980" style="s2">all day long but still not feel that</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.059" end="00:27:34.420" style="s2">crash and I think people can relate to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.980" end="00:27:36.220" style="s2">this if they&#39;ve had too much coffee in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.420" end="00:27:37.510" style="s2">day that feeling of being jittery</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.220" end="00:27:39.309" style="s2">towards the end of the day it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.510" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">occur so how did you design that how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.309" end="00:27:42.220" style="s2">these chemicals work together they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:43.809" style="s2">not really chemicals right they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.220" end="00:27:45.309" style="s2">things that are essential for us that</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.809" end="00:27:47.380" style="s2">our body needs there&#39;s some brain</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.309" end="00:27:49.330" style="s2">vitamins in there tell us about those we</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.380" end="00:27:51.130" style="s2">started by modeling what we were trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.330" end="00:27:52.540" style="s2">to enhance and as you were mentioning it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.130" end="00:27:54.280" style="s2">was actually a lot of things that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.540" end="00:27:56.530" style="s2">not necessarily obvious at first right</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.280" end="00:27:57.910" style="s2">like increased presence isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.530" end="00:27:59.110" style="s2">necessarily what people think of when</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.910" end="00:28:01.300" style="s2">they&#39;re going for a nootropic and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.110" end="00:28:03.130" style="s2">think they want increased focus because</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.300" end="00:28:04.330" style="s2">often times increased focus will lead to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.130" end="00:28:06.910" style="s2">irritability if someone tries to</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.330" end="00:28:08.260" style="s2">distract them so how do we have this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.910" end="00:28:09.610" style="s2">a common adderall thing it&#39;s like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.260" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">just coding it&#39;s cool but if someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.610" end="00:28:13.179" style="s2">distracts me I&#39;m irritable and actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:15.220" style="s2">have a hard time in task switching how</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.179" end="00:28:16.570" style="s2">do we have more focus and more fluid</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.220" end="00:28:19.059" style="s2">task switching and more presence</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.570" end="00:28:20.590" style="s2">wherever we are well enough perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.059" end="00:28:22.030" style="s2">to then decide where we want to move our</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.590" end="00:28:23.830" style="s2">attention back to that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.030" end="00:28:25.809" style="s2">complex functions the other so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.830" end="00:28:27.490" style="s2">started by doing the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.809" end="00:28:28.840" style="s2">psychological modeling of what we were</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.490" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">actually seeking to enhance the whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.840" end="00:28:33.280" style="s2">set of functions and experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.260" style="s2">then how those relate to each other once</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.280" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2">we have that modeled and that&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.260" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">that&#39;s novel right we didn&#39;t start with</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:40.960" style="s2">here&#39;s a disease state and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:42.160" style="s2">one thing that we&#39;re gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.960" end="00:28:43.750" style="s2">adjust in that disease State or even</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.160" end="00:28:44.620" style="s2">here&#39;s an optimization goal and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.750" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">the one thing we started with a</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.620" end="00:28:50.110" style="s2">synergistic goal then we said let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:51.820" style="s2">at since we&#39;re not modifying it via a</p>

<p begin="00:28:51.820" end="00:28:54.940" style="s2">valid or a psychotherapeutic practice</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.940" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">modifying it via modifying the</p>

<p begin="00:29:06.690" end="00:29:11.190" style="s2">we work with neuro technology so</p>

<p begin="00:29:28.830" end="00:29:32.130" style="s2">interested in anything that actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.060" end="00:29:34.170" style="s2">works on some dynamics than being able</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.130" end="00:29:36.360" style="s2">to know which things are in the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.170" end="00:29:38.490" style="s2">meaningful for an individual person and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.360" end="00:29:40.530" style="s2">their goals we&#39;ll get back to that but</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:42.630" style="s2">for this generalized purpose what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.530" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">were looking for is once we understood</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:46.020" style="s2">what psychological and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:48.450" style="s2">functions were seeking to optimize we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.020" end="00:29:50.160" style="s2">wanted to see what physiology mediates</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.450" end="00:29:52.740" style="s2">those and so this is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.160" end="00:29:54.440" style="s2">everything from the cell science and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.740" end="00:29:57.270" style="s2">neuro chemistry and are under chronology</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.440" end="00:30:00.810" style="s2">biophysics what&#39;s known about all the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.270" end="00:30:02.520" style="s2">things that have causal relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.810" end="00:30:03.930" style="s2">short-term memory or to emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.520" end="00:30:05.100" style="s2">resilience right so we look at all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.930" end="00:30:07.290" style="s2">pathways where some studies have</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.100" end="00:30:08.910" style="s2">happened so we started with a structured</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.290" end="00:30:10.860" style="s2">review meta-analysis of all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.910" end="00:30:13.320" style="s2">appropriate spaces to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.860" end="00:30:14.760" style="s2">acetylcholine processing effects these</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.320" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">things glutamate processing effects</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.760" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">these things these ion channels are</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:21.720" style="s2">involved in right so then we end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:24.390" style="s2">having all these underlying physiologic</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.720" end="00:30:26.040" style="s2">pathways and then we model how those</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.390" end="00:30:27.720" style="s2">pathways the entire pathway and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.040" end="00:30:29.310" style="s2">regulatory process of those pathways</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.720" end="00:30:30.900" style="s2">work and how the pathways interact with</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.310" end="00:30:33.000" style="s2">each other to create these complex</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.900" end="00:30:36.920" style="s2">feedback mechanisms which is why we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.000" end="00:30:39.030" style="s2">taking a complex systems approach to</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.920" end="00:30:41.130" style="s2">neuroscience and second row pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.030" end="00:30:43.170" style="s2">once we model that out we said all right</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.130" end="00:30:45.210" style="s2">we want to actually enhance not just the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.170" end="00:30:46.860" style="s2">level of some chemical right raises heal</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.210" end="00:30:48.930" style="s2">choline we want to enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.860" end="00:30:50.820" style="s2">regulatory capacity of this whole system</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.930" end="00:30:52.560" style="s2">so that when someone gets off it</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.820" end="00:30:54.030" style="s2">they don&#39;t have dependents because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.560" end="00:30:56.010" style="s2">become we&#39;ve just created a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.030" end="00:30:57.930" style="s2">exogenous stimuli another dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.010" end="00:30:59.070" style="s2">it but are exogenous stimuli was</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.930" end="00:31:00.660" style="s2">actually working through their</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.070" end="00:31:02.490" style="s2">endogenous their internal regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.660" end="00:31:03.840" style="s2">pathway to robust the resilience of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.490" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">regulatory pathway so when they get off</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.840" end="00:31:08.160" style="s2">it the effects can be lasting so then we</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:10.020" style="s2">looked at how does the entire regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.160" end="00:31:11.610" style="s2">pathway work and what can we do to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.020" end="00:31:12.120" style="s2">able to increase the capacity of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.610" end="00:31:13.380" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.120" end="00:31:15.480" style="s2">I&#39;m almost hearing from you this was an</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.380" end="00:31:17.400" style="s2">inventory of everything that works to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.480" end="00:31:19.350" style="s2">make our cognition fire now would you</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.400" end="00:31:20.140" style="s2">say that nootropics decrease the time</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.350" end="00:31:21.280" style="s2">from once in</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.140" end="00:31:23.920" style="s2">ups to the other the message gets</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.280" end="00:31:25.930" style="s2">through or is this more making a folding</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.920" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">of the safety of the axon of the neuron</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.930" end="00:31:29.680" style="s2">what is it actually doing the nootropic</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:31.180" style="s2">in there between that space between the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.680" end="00:31:34.330" style="s2">dendrite and everything what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.180" end="00:31:37.120" style="s2">there different things so say you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.330" end="00:31:39.310" style="s2">look at acetylcholine right that one</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.120" end="00:31:40.990" style="s2">neurotransmitter for a moment you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.310" end="00:31:44.290" style="s2">use something like Cooper&#39;s na which is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.990" end="00:31:46.210" style="s2">a very common nootropic which is what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.290" end="00:31:48.160" style="s2">call an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.210" end="00:31:49.420" style="s2">which was on the 4-hour body right</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.160" end="00:31:52.270" style="s2">didn&#39;t Tim Ferriss write about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.420" end="00:31:54.040" style="s2">quite a bit probably yeah it&#39;s a common</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.270" end="00:31:55.390" style="s2">nootropic it&#39;s a plant derived</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.040" end="00:31:56.500" style="s2">neurotropic there are other things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.390" end="00:31:58.360" style="s2">are also acetylcholine esterase</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.500" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">inhibitors both pharmaceutical and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.360" end="00:32:02.170" style="s2">plant-based and what that&#39;s doing is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:03.550" style="s2">there&#39;s an enzyme in the synapse oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.170" end="00:32:04.960" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about between the axon</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.550" end="00:32:06.670" style="s2">and the dendrite right in the synaptic</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.960" end="00:32:07.990" style="s2">cleft there&#39;s an enzyme that breaks down</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.670" end="00:32:09.370" style="s2">acetylcholine so you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.990" end="00:32:10.780" style="s2">excessive amounts of it but it can also</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.370" end="00:32:12.130" style="s2">break it down too fast so you then end</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.780" end="00:32:13.810" style="s2">up having deficient amounts with that</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.130" end="00:32:15.970" style="s2">cause brain fog if it&#39;s too fast in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.810" end="00:32:17.410" style="s2">breakdown it can write but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.970" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">important brain fog doesn&#39;t have one</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.410" end="00:32:21.340" style="s2">cause has lots of causes it can be from</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:23.020" style="s2">neuro inflammation it can be from</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.340" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">deficiency or excess of lots of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.020" end="00:32:28.330" style="s2">different neurotransmitters so but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:31.060" style="s2">could be one of them so you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.330" end="00:32:32.800" style="s2">inhibit that enzyme so the same amount</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.060" end="00:32:34.540" style="s2">of acetylcholine that is coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.800" end="00:32:36.070" style="s2">the axon can actually get across the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.540" end="00:32:37.360" style="s2">synapse more effectively that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.070" end="00:32:39.010" style="s2">thing you could do if you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.360" end="00:32:40.540" style="s2">what&#39;s happening chemically so in</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.010" end="00:32:42.400" style="s2">acetylcholine esterase inhibitor would</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.540" end="00:32:44.740" style="s2">be one way to modulate the acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.400" end="00:32:45.940" style="s2">pathway but once it gets across the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.740" end="00:32:48.040" style="s2">synapse it&#39;s going to be actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.940" end="00:32:51.100" style="s2">getting up taken in the postsynaptic</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.040" end="00:32:52.690" style="s2">neuron in various receptors and so we</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.100" end="00:32:53.920" style="s2">could modulate one of those receptors so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.690" end="00:32:57.550" style="s2">we can use things like rasa Tam&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.920" end="00:33:00.340" style="s2">piracetam aniracetam etc to upregulate</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.550" end="00:33:02.620" style="s2">say the acetylcholine uptake on the nmda</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.340" end="00:33:03.490" style="s2">complex that&#39;s another thing that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.620" end="00:33:05.260" style="s2">could do we could do those in</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.490" end="00:33:07.900" style="s2">combination or separately we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.260" end="00:33:09.550" style="s2">actually provide more choline donors or</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.900" end="00:33:13.150" style="s2">acetyl donors for the body to make more</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.550" end="00:33:15.730" style="s2">acetylcholine we could provide the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.150" end="00:33:18.040" style="s2">catalysts like vitamin b5 and other</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.730" end="00:33:20.290" style="s2">things that helps take calling in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.040" end="00:33:22.360" style="s2">acetylated so there&#39;s a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.290" end="00:33:24.160" style="s2">that we can do to affect the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.360" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">acetylcholine pathway and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.160" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">one pathway then there&#39;s two stages why</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:30.700" style="s2">taking the first stage without food and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.590" style="s2">then waiting and then food with the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.700" end="00:33:33.480" style="s2">second stage I had to play around with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.590" end="00:33:34.710" style="s2">bit to find my</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.480" end="00:33:36.390" style="s2">perfect dose to where I could just be</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.710" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">present but then not feel like I was too</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.390" end="00:33:39.570" style="s2">much energized</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:41.160" style="s2">tell us about that why you break it up</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.570" end="00:33:43.950" style="s2">into two I&#39;ve never done that before</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.160" end="00:33:45.770" style="s2">okay so qualia currently has two bottles</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.950" end="00:33:49.169" style="s2">it&#39;s a program that someone would take</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.770" end="00:33:51.960" style="s2">just for clarity when we were initially</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.169" end="00:33:53.190" style="s2">modeling what are all of the chemicals</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.960" end="00:33:54.419" style="s2">that we know something meaningful about</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.190" end="00:33:55.710" style="s2">that could modify any of those</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.419" end="00:33:58.830" style="s2">underlying pathways we created a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">database of about 500 chemicals and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.830" end="00:34:02.790" style="s2">looked at what the primary pathways they</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:05.400" style="s2">affect secondary pathways etc and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.790" end="00:34:08.490" style="s2">we did a whole bunch of customized</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.400" end="00:34:10.679" style="s2">chemistry for this kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.490" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">enhancement goal where we were working</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.679" end="00:34:16.200" style="s2">with integrative doctors running very</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:18.750" style="s2">deep blood chemistry on people clinical</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.200" end="00:34:21.000" style="s2">chemistry brain scans genomics etc and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.750" end="00:34:23.310" style="s2">then really working to optimize in very</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.000" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">unique ways once we saw that we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.310" end="00:34:26.790" style="s2">get the kinds of effects we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:27.899" style="s2">get really profound upregulation across</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.790" end="00:34:29.580" style="s2">all the things they were interested in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.899" end="00:34:31.200" style="s2">without any of the kinds of down</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.580" end="00:34:33.990" style="s2">regulation we wanted to avoid that we</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.200" end="00:34:36.030" style="s2">could assess then we wanted to see what</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.990" end="00:34:37.500" style="s2">portion of that could we do in a non</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.030" end="00:34:39.090" style="s2">customized fashion so that we could</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.500" end="00:34:40.800" style="s2">bring it at scale because obviously</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.090" end="00:34:42.629" style="s2">doing it that kind of customization at</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.800" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">scale is very difficult and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.629" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">things that we couldn&#39;t work with</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:47.669" style="s2">because they&#39;re so specific to one set</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:49.260" style="s2">of genes that what would be beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.669" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">for someone is too harmful to other</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.260" end="00:34:54.090" style="s2">people but we want to see which dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:56.040" style="s2">can we work with effectively across most</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.090" end="00:34:57.780" style="s2">of the population so then that looked</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.040" end="00:34:59.700" style="s2">like a you know a bunch of internal</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.780" end="00:35:01.980" style="s2">product development trials iterations</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.700" end="00:35:05.970" style="s2">were using 23andme tests as well that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.980" end="00:35:07.890" style="s2">was one of the things some people were</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.970" end="00:35:09.480" style="s2">giving us 23andme data some people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.890" end="00:35:11.940" style="s2">giving us Illumina data some people were</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.480" end="00:35:14.550" style="s2">going much deeper and also looking at</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.940" end="00:35:16.710" style="s2">what&#39;s actually expressing but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.550" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">also of course just doing the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.710" end="00:35:20.900" style="s2">of all of the journal articles in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:25.140" style="s2">various spaces and doing you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.900" end="00:35:28.020" style="s2">structured synthesis so the 42 is one</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.140" end="00:35:29.520" style="s2">iteration it&#39;s one iteration that ended</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.020" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">up being the right one for us to come to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.520" end="00:35:32.280" style="s2">market with first but it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:33.900" style="s2">change in the reason there was two</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.280" end="00:35:35.160" style="s2">different things two different products</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.900" end="00:35:37.170" style="s2">specifically some of the ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:38.010" style="s2">absorb very well without food since</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.170" end="00:35:40.140" style="s2">these are pills that people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.010" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">swallowing we could have things that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.140" end="00:35:45.180" style="s2">were injections I am or IV or intranasal</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:46.830" style="s2">or but there&#39;s safety and regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.180" end="00:35:47.460" style="s2">reasons would be hard to sell needles as</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.830" end="00:35:51.210" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.460" end="00:35:52.769" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t have any moral issue</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.210" end="00:35:54.690" style="s2">with that if it&#39;s actually safe and</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.769" end="00:35:56.970" style="s2">effective we were just simply looking at</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.690" end="00:35:58.170" style="s2">what the safest way for things to go to</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.970" end="00:36:00.779" style="s2">the most number of people for the most</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.170" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">enhancement can happen and so since</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.779" end="00:36:06.000" style="s2">we&#39;re having to do GI absorption then</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:07.140" style="s2">some things really absorb much better</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.000" end="00:36:08.789" style="s2">without food where they get to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.140" end="00:36:10.319" style="s2">maximum surface area contact other</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.789" end="00:36:13.019" style="s2">things really need food for absorption</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.319" end="00:36:14.910" style="s2">and to avoid nausea and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.019" end="00:36:16.380" style="s2">particular stack of chemicals we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.910" end="00:36:17.759" style="s2">working with we ended up separating it</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.380" end="00:36:19.200" style="s2">for that purpose yeah one of the things</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.800" end="00:55:16.860" style="s2">different because they have different</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.870" end="00:55:43.350" style="s2">just look at individual biometrics in</p>

<p begin="00:57:57.090" end="00:58:00.300" style="s2">has been so much fun I want to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.740" end="00:58:01.080" style="s2">seven questions and they&#39;re really fast</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.300" end="00:58:03.150" style="s2">so if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.080" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">get to know you okay the first question</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.150" end="00:58:06.510" style="s2">is what fascinates you the most I mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:07.980" style="s2">we already know that you have a high</p>

<p begin="00:58:07.980" end="00:58:11.580" style="s2">biological systems but what about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.780" end="00:58:13.410" style="s2">brain fascinates you the most as in</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.580" end="00:58:15.000" style="s2">regards to neuroplasticity the way that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.410" end="00:58:16.710" style="s2">the brain can shift and mold and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.000" end="00:58:18.510" style="s2">change what lights you up when you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.710" end="00:58:23.370" style="s2">about neuroplasticity so interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.510" end="00:58:27.150" style="s2">our team just did a structured review of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.370" end="00:58:28.710" style="s2">all the literature on neurogenesis so</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.850" end="00:58:54.900" style="s2">the space and then started looking at</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.800" end="00:58:57.360" style="s2">what the relationship between all the</p>

<p begin="00:58:57.360" end="00:59:01.140" style="s2">are and the evolutionary biology of why</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.220" end="00:59:03.210" style="s2">humans have as much neurogenic capacity</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.140" end="00:59:06.750" style="s2">as we have we&#39;re also doing structured</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.210" end="00:59:09.480" style="s2">review of everything on that</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.750" end="00:59:11.910" style="s2">how to remove senescent neurons so</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.910" end="00:59:14.850" style="s2">or mould neurons that are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.350" end="00:59:15.300" style="s2">functioning as well they&#39;re not serving</p>

<p begin="00:59:25.650" end="00:59:30.330" style="s2">so how does how do we get rid of old</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.410" end="00:59:32.070" style="s2">brain cells that are not functioning</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.330" end="00:59:33.660" style="s2">well and causing dysfunction develop new</p>

<p begin="01:01:23.109" end="01:01:27.970" style="s2">experiencing anxiety I dealt with</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.700" end="01:01:29.759" style="s2">anxiety a lot in my 20s to the point</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.970" end="01:01:31.509" style="s2">where I would not go out for days</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.759" end="01:01:33.849" style="s2">someone&#39;s feeling like that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.509" end="01:01:36.339" style="s2">listening what are some things they can</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.849" end="01:01:38.289" style="s2">do in addition to to taking a smart</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.339" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">nootropic or having a healthy regimen of</p>

<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:43.089" style="s2">people can do as a first or second step</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.710" end="01:01:45.819" style="s2">when they&#39;re going through kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.089" end="01:01:49.329" style="s2">paralyzing anxiety well the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.819" end="01:01:52.839" style="s2">I would say is I feel you I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.329" end="01:01:54.970" style="s2">there I know how scary and crippling</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.839" end="01:01:57.130" style="s2">that can be one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.970" end="01:01:59.589" style="s2">trickiest about anxiety is we can feel</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.130" end="01:02:03.190" style="s2">anxiety about anything it can be a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.589" end="01:02:06.279" style="s2">relationship ending or money or getting</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.190" end="01:02:08.049" style="s2">on stage or whatever and then if that</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.279" end="01:02:11.319" style="s2">anxiety ever gets to a high enough point</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.049" end="01:02:15.099" style="s2">that gets scary to us then we start any</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.319" end="01:02:17.500" style="s2">source of anxiety like normal stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.099" end="01:02:19.180" style="s2">happens we become hypersensitive to our</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.500" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">own sensations of anxiety then we become</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.180" end="01:02:22.420" style="s2">anxious about it and then we get in</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:24.609" style="s2">these feedback loops and so then we</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.420" end="01:02:25.990" style="s2">become scared of going to situations</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.609" end="01:02:27.109" style="s2">that we&#39;ll be scared of then we notice a</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.990" end="01:02:28.099" style="s2">little bit of fear and gosh</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.109" end="01:02:29.869" style="s2">is that thing going to happen again</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.099" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">right and so panic attacks are where</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.869" end="01:02:34.369" style="s2">that just goes to Zenith and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:35.480" style="s2">get afraid well it&#39;s never gonna end I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.369" end="01:02:36.890" style="s2">gonna be stuck in this forever which</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.480" end="01:02:39.319" style="s2">becomes the ultimate fear and then</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.890" end="01:02:43.690" style="s2">depression kicks in first thing I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.319" end="01:02:45.680" style="s2">is I&#39;ve worked with a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.690" end="01:02:47.930" style="s2">panic attack disorder and generalized</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.680" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">anxiety disorder and seen people shift</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.930" end="01:02:52.249" style="s2">from decades of these situations through</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:55.220" style="s2">different mechanisms and different</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.249" end="01:02:56.210" style="s2">modalities but it is addressable that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.220" end="01:02:58.039" style="s2">the first thing I would say is it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.210" end="01:02:59.900" style="s2">addressable you need to find the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.039" end="01:03:01.849" style="s2">solutions they are not one right best</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.900" end="01:03:04.489" style="s2">solution for different people some</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.849" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">people have got disorders and you can</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.489" end="01:03:07.670" style="s2">feel that you&#39;ve got got disorders you</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:09.200" style="s2">address the gut disorder and the gut</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.670" end="01:03:12.019" style="s2">brain access optimising makes a</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.200" end="01:03:13.400" style="s2">tremendous difference there are other</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.019" end="01:03:16.759" style="s2">people where just addressing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.400" end="01:03:18.140" style="s2">meditation side of it will make enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.759" end="01:03:19.910" style="s2">shift that they have the energy to start</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.140" end="01:03:22.670" style="s2">addressing other things other people</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.910" end="01:03:24.650" style="s2">there were there were those cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.670" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">loops that are going on where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.650" end="01:03:27.980" style="s2">afraid of their own symptom of fear</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:29.480" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy will</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.980" end="01:03:30.739" style="s2">actually address those cognitive loops</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.480" end="01:03:33.170" style="s2">quite quickly so there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.739" end="01:03:35.960" style="s2">modalities that can be effective try</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.170" end="01:03:39.380" style="s2">them like big responsibility for working</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.960" end="01:03:41.690" style="s2">at it and if some are not working then</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.380" end="01:03:43.069" style="s2">don&#39;t make a generalized assessment that</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.690" end="01:03:44.630" style="s2">nothing will work or nothing works for</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.069" end="01:03:46.190" style="s2">you or your anxieties particularly</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.630" end="01:03:48.529" style="s2">different or worse it&#39;s not just keep</p>

<p begin="01:07:15.319" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">awesome so that&#39;s one way another way is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.469" end="01:07:27.140" style="s2">since our goals are ultimately you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:29.089" style="s2">we there&#39;s one meta imperative that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.140" end="01:07:30.979" style="s2">all share which is how do we optimize</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.089" end="01:07:33.640" style="s2">the quality of life for all life right</p>

<p begin="01:08:05.719" end="01:08:11.089" style="s2">us my last question for you is really</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.329" end="01:08:14.059" style="s2">profound because you have such a depth</p>

<p begin="01:08:14.059" end="01:08:16.849" style="s2">where you&#39;re meditating as a kid and</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.529" end="01:08:19.250" style="s2">you&#39;ve created so much and what you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:08:19.250" end="01:08:22.099" style="s2">with all that set I mean what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.779" end="01:08:23.900" style="s2">wellness to you how would you define</p>

<p begin="01:08:23.900" end="01:08:29.500" style="s2">mentioning earlier our direct personal</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.989" end="01:08:31.989" style="s2">experience is intrinsically valuable</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.500" end="01:08:36.799" style="s2">independent of anything that it affects</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.989" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">right the universe is experiencing</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.799" end="01:08:43.309" style="s2">itself through our experience of it and</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:44.750" style="s2">so wellness is the depth and the choice</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.309" end="01:08:48.259" style="s2">and the profundity and the beauty of our</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.750" end="01:08:50.389" style="s2">experience that&#39;s part of it and what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.259" end="01:08:53.480" style="s2">do that affects the experience of</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.389" end="01:08:55.250" style="s2">everyone else everything else is also</p>
