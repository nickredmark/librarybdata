<p begin="00:00:15.280" end="00:00:19.359" style="s2">about why it is that we are so confused</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.840" end="00:00:21.039" style="s2">about covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.359" end="00:00:23.039" style="s2">and what we are supposed to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.039" end="00:00:24.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.039" end="00:00:26.480" style="s2">are you ready to embark on that</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.160" end="00:00:28.960" style="s2">discussion i am all right</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.480" end="00:00:29.840" style="s2">so let&#39;s talk about what we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.960" end="00:00:32.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.840" end="00:00:33.040" style="s2">in the world and you know we are all</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.480" end="00:00:35.360" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:37.280" style="s2">the world through this lens that is</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.360" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">social media and i have to say one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.280" end="00:00:40.239" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:40.960" style="s2">lessons of all of this i suspect is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.239" end="00:00:43.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.960" end="00:00:44.800" style="s2">social media has become the ghost in our</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.760" end="00:00:47.200" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.800" end="00:00:48.879" style="s2">and on the one hand that may sound</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.200" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">nonsensical because we can see what</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:51.440" style="s2">social media is but the algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:54.000" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.440" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">obviously haunt our thinking in ways</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.000" end="00:00:57.199" style="s2">that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:58.719" style="s2">can&#39;t even test are you suggesting the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.199" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">pandemic has</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.719" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">made social media into more of a ghost</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">in the machine or that it has merely</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">revealed it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:07.520" style="s2">more stark relief yeah i think because</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">nobody has a real</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.520" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">handle on this because it is emerging in</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:14.080" style="s2">real time</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:15.520" style="s2">we are seeing something about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.080" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">magnitude of its effect</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:20.799" style="s2">and we have talked about uh phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">that you cannot detect directly</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.799" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">but that you can detect as gravity you</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">know so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">for example um the existence of a planet</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">that manifests first not</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">as our ability to see a planet but its</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:34.159" style="s2">effect on</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.840" style="s2">other planets in their orbits we can</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.159" end="00:01:36.560" style="s2">estimate how big the effect is and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.840" end="00:01:39.119" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.560" end="00:01:41.840" style="s2">uh we are seeing something here of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.119" end="00:01:44.000" style="s2">extraordinary magnitude</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s to be honest with you not very</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.640" style="s2">um but what exactly it is and why it</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">works the way it does</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.640" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">is less clear yeah because it is hidden</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.680" style="s2">in a a literally private layer</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:59.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the ultimate black box in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.280" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">listening to you talk it it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:04.960" style="s2">you could be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">the algorithms in social media as the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.960" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">ghost in the machine</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:09.520" style="s2">and not so much that goes to the machine</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:12.160" style="s2">but so much of what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.520" end="00:02:13.120" style="s2">actually could apply equally to what</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.160" end="00:02:15.680" style="s2">this virus</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.120" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">is and how it&#39;s doing what it&#39;s doing in</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.680" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">various layers in society</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">well i mean i think these things are and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve said from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">that these are two very different things</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">there&#39;s the hazard of the virus and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:29.920" style="s2">there&#39;s the hazard of its effect on us</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">and at the moment as concerned as i am</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.920" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">about the virus</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">i&#39;m much more concerned about what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">going to do to each other as we attempt</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.680" style="s2">uh issues of social distancing and mask</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:45.200" style="s2">wearing and the like</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.680" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">yup um i actually start by uh</p>

<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">townsfolk were not more to blame than</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">an idea that may make some people smile</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">but the only means of fighting a plague</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">is common decency</p>

<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">beautiful so i think then the natural</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.120" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">thing to do is to take a look at the two</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">clips that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">found circulating online about the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">these clips happen to be from the us</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">about the way some americans are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:27.280" style="s2">treating other americans in light of</p>

<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">was circulating</p>

<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:35.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about yeah that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.080" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">but it you know who knows how many</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">flus do kill people and copen19 is</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:24.320" style="s2">but the long-term effects</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.160" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">as i don&#39;t remember which number it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.320" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">but you talked at some length in one of</p>

<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">about um it was the one we were talking</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.480" end="00:09:44.959" style="s2">contributes just a little bit to making</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">injury and insult and illness and it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:53.920" style="s2">shortens the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.600" style="s2">literally shortens the lifespan of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:57.680" style="s2">cell lines that have been injured</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.600" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">right like it actually just literally</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.680" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">does that and each of your cell lines is</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">not the same as your individual life</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">but without a significant number of your</p>

<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">and this is of course what senescence is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.920" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s you know it&#39;s like a video</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:14.240" style="s2">game in which you have some quantity of</p>

<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.959" style="s2">um now if one of those people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.800" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">coughed on somebody were chased out</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.959" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">by people in masks um i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">i think i would get it and i think i</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">would accept it but assuming that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.120" style="s2">happen here</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:19.279" style="s2">my sense is you&#39;re still turning on</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.120" end="00:12:19.920" style="s2">another citizen who&#39;s as confused as you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.279" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.920" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">right yeah well there we&#39;ve been handed</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:28.160" style="s2">a lot of simple rubrics some of which</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">contradict one another</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.160" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">some of which have changed over time</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:32.959" style="s2">like you know as we talked about i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">in our very first</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.959" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">live stream here the surgeon general of</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:38.639" style="s2">the united states and the who were both</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">saying masks don&#39;t wear masks they do</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.639" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">you no good</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">uh before they both reversed completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">similarly and this isn&#39;t exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">same kind of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:50.800" style="s2">one of the things that&#39;s being done as</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:52.880" style="s2">places begin to open up at least in</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.800" end="00:12:55.440" style="s2">areas in the u.s that i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.880" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">is that in some in some kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.440" end="00:13:00.399" style="s2">establishments that are opening up</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">they are doing temperature checks at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.399" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">door</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:09.279" style="s2">and this strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">mostly ridiculous because most people it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.279" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">seems according to</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">our current and mostly like all the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:16.480" style="s2">back in our understanding of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:18.800" style="s2">particular disease</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.480" end="00:13:21.120" style="s2">are asymptomatic and are spreading the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.800" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">thing even if they become symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.120" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">are most infectious um or at least quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:26.560" style="s2">infectious before they develop any</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">symptoms at all</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.560" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">so the asymptomatic and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:31.120" style="s2">pre-symptomatic asymptomatic and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:32.079" style="s2">pre-symptomatic are both capable of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.120" end="00:13:35.360" style="s2">spreading disease</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.079" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2">the the never exposed are obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.360" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">capable of spreading disease because</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">they do not have it</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">but presymptomatic and asymptomatic are</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">both terms that refer to people who</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">have the disease are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:48.079" style="s2">spreading it or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">are have the disease in them and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.079" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">taking people&#39;s temperatures seems like</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:54.000" style="s2">a pacifying move</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.320" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">a way to make people feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.000" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">doing something like they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:14:00.000" style="s2">active and it&#39;s not going it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">going to give people a false sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.000" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">security</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">and i worry that many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">who are engaged in flaunting the rules</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">are reading are hearing</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">wear masks and take your temperature and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:21.440" style="s2">stay indoors as similar sorts of rubrics</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.399" style="s2">that all make no sense and of course the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.440" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">first one</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.399" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">does make sense from an epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:28.800" style="s2">perspective wear masks when you are</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">in stores with strangers or with or in</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.800" end="00:14:32.560" style="s2">close proximity to other people</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.240" style="s2">whom you do not know the health history</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.560" end="00:14:36.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.240" end="00:14:37.680" style="s2">do you know take people&#39;s temperatures</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">at every moment possible</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.680" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">and have the sense then that if they</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have an elevated temperature at</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:43.760" style="s2">the moment then they&#39;re healthy</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">no they&#39;re not necessarily healthy now</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.760" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">if they do have an elevated temperature</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">you know something maybe but you also</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know if they have covered 19 then</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">we have something else</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:55.440" style="s2">yeah although in a world where</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">we all got the same software update so</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">we all understood what the implications</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">of a temperature being taken</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">was i could see it as one piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">of a much larger strategy in other words</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">how many illnesses could you prevent</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">if everybody whose temperature was</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">elevated at the point they wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">enter a place</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">was barred obviously it doesn&#39;t bar the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:18.880" style="s2">people who are completely asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">or completely pre-symptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.880" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">but it would stop a certain number</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:26.720" style="s2">of cases so you have to put up that</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">savings</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.720" end="00:15:30.160" style="s2">against the false sense of security</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:32.480" style="s2">which actually could kill people</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.160" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">the sense that it&#39;s safe enough might be</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.480" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">worse than the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:37.839" style="s2">and you know the the behavioral role</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.040" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">which has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:41.440" style="s2">around for decades which is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">sick stay home</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.440" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">you know hopefully you you know right</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:45.759" style="s2">now this doesn&#39;t pertain but you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:47.680" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.759" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">go to a school or you go to you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.680" end="00:15:51.360" style="s2">workplace that if you&#39;re sick you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">going to get penalized for</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.360" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">or calling in sick and staying home and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">of course many people don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:59.279" style="s2">luxury under normal conditions</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">but um when people go out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.279" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">when they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">actively sick they are causing problems</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">for not just themselves they are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:06.720" style="s2">just extending the life of their own</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:09.040" style="s2">sickness but they are of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.720" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">risking other people and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.040" end="00:16:12.959" style="s2">who have active fevers</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">uh shouldn&#39;t be out there in the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.959" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">place and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:19.040" style="s2">i i worry actually more about the false</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">sense of security from</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.040" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">temperature taking stations than i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">the value</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:27.040" style="s2">will be gained from catching the few</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:29.519" style="s2">people who have</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.040" end="00:16:31.600" style="s2">active fevers at the moment because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.519" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">really does see you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.600" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s medicalizing of in this case and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:38.639" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">medical process but because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.639" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">because it&#39;s a metric because it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:44.000" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:46.079" style="s2">action done by someone to you and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.000" end="00:16:48.639" style="s2">you have a number</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.079" end="00:16:50.480" style="s2">people love numbers we and in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.639" end="00:16:52.560" style="s2">think that the most enumerable among us</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.480" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">are the most fond of these simple</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.560" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">measures that may not mean what they</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:16:59.120" style="s2">what we think they mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">and so i very much worry about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.120" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">of being out there being told</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">oh yeah your temperature is fine maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:06.079" style="s2">that means that they&#39;re less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">wear a mask</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.079" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">in a crowded store for instance</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">yeah in some sense i think though if</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">and it may well be right it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">small corner of a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">and the big problem is that if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">one thing we know about sars cove</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">to and covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">it&#39;s part of a complex system not only</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">is the virus itself a part of a complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">system</p>

<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">and um that is i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">allowing people to be driven crazy so if</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:38.000" style="s2">and the way that it interfaces with the</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.000" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s just false leads everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.160" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">there are things that appear to be</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">were patterns for a moment and then the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.080" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">pattern evaporated because it was</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:59.919" style="s2">which is frankly even worse than</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.440" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">americans and in some sense the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">were somewhat galvanized by facing</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">this very frightening pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">as one we were all seeing it for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">first time it was disrupting</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">almost every life every human life on</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">and that disruption</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.760" end="00:19:35.200" style="s2">caused us all to think because what else</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">were we going to do yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.200" end="00:19:38.400" style="s2">but something took our willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:41.520" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.400" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">and it captured it it&#39;s now delivering</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.840" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">they&#39;re based on the political advantage</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">that comes from</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">pushing one story much farther than any</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">of the actual evidence suggests</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">and the question is a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:08.159" style="s2">is there any way to avoid this</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">and b if there&#39;s not what is going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.159" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">happen when</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:15.679" style="s2">even covet 19 can&#39;t get us to put</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">our political bias biases and</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.679" end="00:20:18.480" style="s2">allegiances</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">aside i mean we&#39;re going to tear each</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.480" end="00:20:23.919" style="s2">other apart yeah no and it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:26.400" style="s2">like like the u.s is doing a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.919" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">particularly poor job of this</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.400" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">at least this is this is thomas chariton</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">williams take and i&#39;ve seen a few other</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:35.760" style="s2">places as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">that we are polarizing more fully</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.760" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">than other places and it does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">come down to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">the classic tension that most people</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">don&#39;t think of as a tension</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">between freedom or liberty and justice</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:51.039" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:51.679" style="s2">you know we are we are promised both in</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.039" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">this country</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.679" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">right and it is imagined that liberty</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">and justice are two</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">of the very few primary ideals of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:00.880" style="s2">democracy that this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.880" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">is supposed to be providing liberty uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:08.080" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">while not uh taking much of your liberty</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.080" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">but we have these sort of caricatures of</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:15.280" style="s2">these positions right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">on basically on the far left we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.280" end="00:21:19.280" style="s2">slide it all the way over to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">justice freedom be damned liberty be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.280" end="00:21:22.000" style="s2">damned</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:23.840" style="s2">and on the extreme right we have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.000" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">slider all the way to extreme</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.840" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">liberty justice be damned and the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">of coughing on someone else you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:32.640" style="s2">you are actively taking away the the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">rights of other people</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.640" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">and um and you know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:42.000" style="s2">in the sort of no nuance world of we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">be in locked in full lockdown maybe in</p>

<p begin="00:21:46.559" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t really see that but i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">it&#39;s out there to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">um uh also relieves everyone sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">maximally of their freedom</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">of their liberty and i was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:00.480" style="s2">about this the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">with liberty and justice for all of</p>

<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:37.039" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">well if you were really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.039" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">maximize liberty</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">then you would have to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:45.440" style="s2">somebody else ending up</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">in the icu has to be counted against</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.440" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">liberty you&#39;re not very free if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">in the icu</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">so there is always a question about</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">whether the liberty you are maximizing</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:58.559" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:24:01.600" style="s2">narrow or whether it is broad</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.559" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">maximizing broad liberty requires</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.600" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">high quality regulation of things if</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">everybody&#39;s free to drive on both sides</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">of the road</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not very free to drive anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.159" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">because you&#39;re taking your life into</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.600" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">your hands every time you get behind the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">wheel</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:15.279" style="s2">so we have to limit your freedom to one</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">side of the road or the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.279" end="00:24:18.640" style="s2">in order for you to be free to drive</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">from here to wherever</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.640" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">right that&#39;s an excellent example</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">likewise you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">massive regulation that surrounds air</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.039" end="00:24:27.120" style="s2">travel</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">right the ability to fly anywhere on</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.120" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">earth i mean that&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">boon to freedom it comes from regulation</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that makes it possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">so anyone who&#39;s ever flown has benefited</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">from regulation</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">right and you frankly you know you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:41.520" style="s2">have to be crazy not to want it that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:43.200" style="s2">does that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:44.720" style="s2">mean that there are not places where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.200" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">regulations go too far</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.720" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">no of course there are and you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:49.600" style="s2">even build a system in which there</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.320" end="00:24:50.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be excesses</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.600" end="00:24:52.559" style="s2">there will be excesses there will be</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.960" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">places where the regulations don&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.559" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">far enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">that&#39;s noise but the um</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">the position that has people</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:07.600" style="s2">rejecting the importance of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">and thereby arguing in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.600" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">basically a return to normalcy right</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">down to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">face coverings not being uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">not only not being required but mocking</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">people who wear them which is now an</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:22.000" style="s2">active</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">feature of the landscape this is absurd</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.000" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">and the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">the thing that is missing the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:31.039" style="s2">increasingly is haunting me</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">is i don&#39;t see a contingent who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.039" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">we really have to open back up</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">that&#39;s a very dangerous thing to do the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:45.279" style="s2">is with extreme caution with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.279" end="00:25:51.120" style="s2">face masks and physical distancing so</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.640" style="s2">instead of you know the position there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.120" end="00:25:54.640" style="s2">nothing to worry about let&#39;s just go</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.640" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">back to normal i would expect to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.640" end="00:25:57.679" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">advocating for let us go back to</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.679" end="00:26:02.200" style="s2">economic normalcy</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">and in order to do that let us behave in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.200" end="00:26:05.520" style="s2">extremely</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:06.640" style="s2">careful and meticulous fashion with</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.520" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">respect to how</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.640" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">we are around each other what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">that what i think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think that is my position</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.720" style="s2">i think actually it&#39;s not time to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">back to normalcy yet because the danger</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.720" end="00:26:20.080" style="s2">is still too great and the unknowns are</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">still too large but i understand the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.080" end="00:26:23.200" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">and yet you see almost no one occupying</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.200" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">the position i see almost no one</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">occupying the position and that tells me</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:29.279" style="s2">something is not right here</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">what&#39;s more and you and i have been on</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.279" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">this uh from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">there are places where actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">the nature of covet 19 as we see it in</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">may of 2020</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">is such that we could afford more</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:45.440" style="s2">liberty so to the extent that there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">places where we actually have to curtail</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.440" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">liberty right now for the greater good</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.360" style="s2">there are places we can afford to relax</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">it so i would expect to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.360" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">a intelligent synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">position that said look outside for</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:02.159" style="s2">reasons we don&#39;t yet understand</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re way safer than we thought okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.159" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">outside is pretty safe so let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">advantage of that side what does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">mean clock&#39;s ticking</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:10.320" style="s2">in the northern hemisphere where most of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">us live</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.320" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">summer is about to dawn it&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">to last forever vitamin d is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">important component</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">so let us take advantage of outdoors let</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:21.039" style="s2">us let us ratchet up</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">our return to normalcy outdoors as much</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.039" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">as we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:27.200" style="s2">but i would say if you&#39;re engaged in an</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">activity that makes it difficult to wear</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.200" end="00:27:29.679" style="s2">a mask if you&#39;re biking hard if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">running hard</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.679" end="00:27:32.799" style="s2">probably you don&#39;t want to be wearing a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">mask we went out for a family bike ride</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.799" end="00:27:36.559" style="s2">the other day a long one</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">15 miles into town that involves quite a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.559" end="00:27:39.360" style="s2">few hills</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">quite a few hills we had masks with us</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.360" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">we wore them if we were near people but</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">as we were riding hard we weren&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t have them over our mouths don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">think any of us ever put them</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.080" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">on while we&#39;re biking not while we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">riding but when we were</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">stopped and there were people um but</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">in any case so you can make a judgment</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">call there</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">um but what i you know again i think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">intelligent position would have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">recognize</p>

<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">outside then it will probably go from</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">to figuring out how to do it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">will lose that opportunity so we should</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">protect it we should cherish it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">but i don&#39;t see this position and what</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">that tells me is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">the opportunity for us to become</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">is being lost in favor of some</p>

<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">which is um oddly um</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">given this that this uh we won&#39;t wear</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:22.080" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:25.279" style="s2">uh groupthink</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.080" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">is coming out of the right it is a it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.279" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">using a demographic marker to identify</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.039" style="s2">people exactly in the same way that the</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:40.080" style="s2">and just as grip thinking so i&#39;m now</p>

<p begin="00:30:40.080" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">but i see a kind of analogy</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:48.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:50.240" style="s2">subscribe to a narrow version of liberty</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.799" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">right i want to be free to do anything i</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.240" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">want to do at any moment right</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">that kind of liberty um</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:31:02.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a way that those people become</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:06.640" style="s2">suckers they become pawns of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.159" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">corporate force that is you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.640" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">subtly enslaving us and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">um the thing you know you said early</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">uh in our discussion here that the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">thing to do if you&#39;re sick is to stay</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">home and then you pointed out the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">obvious fact that for most people</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">they know that that&#39;s not the rule</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:26.880" style="s2">because they know</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.240" style="s2">that their livelihood depends on keeping</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.880" end="00:31:29.919" style="s2">their employer happy</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.240" end="00:31:32.320" style="s2">and that their employee has a perverse</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.919" end="00:31:34.720" style="s2">incentive where the employer</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.320" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want the whole workforce to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.720" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">sick</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">but to the extent that somebody is sick</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:41.120" style="s2">and capable of working frankly if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">whole workforce could work</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.120" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">sick and nobody is in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">prove that they got sick</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.360" style="s2">at your establishment because you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">incentivized your workers to come in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.360" end="00:31:54.159" style="s2">when they weren&#39;t well um that the cost</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:56.640" style="s2">is externalized</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.159" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">they would be fine with it and so that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.640" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">perverse incentive has</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:06.399" style="s2">infected our whole economy such that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.840" style="s2">everybody who is in some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">jeopardy is depending</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.840" end="00:32:12.960" style="s2">on their employer uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">feeling good about their work anybody</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.960" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">who is easily replaced because of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:20.159" style="s2">nature of their work</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">or especially at least in the u.s given</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.159" end="00:32:25.840" style="s2">our rather draconian</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t have sick leave and so what do</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.399" end="00:32:39.039" style="s2">you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">if you need to pay the rent and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.039" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">and you what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re actually at the level that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">you&#39;re going to need the next paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:54.880" style="s2">make it yeah and skipping out means</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">not just not just losing a day</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.880" end="00:32:58.960" style="s2">but potentially antagonizing a boss who</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:00.880" style="s2">has lots of other hungry people who</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.960" end="00:33:02.480" style="s2">probably want this probably not very</p>

<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:06.000" style="s2">you know not only do we need to go back</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">to work</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.000" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">but we don&#39;t need to do it carefully</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:13.040" style="s2">i would say knee-jerk mindset is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.040" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">cryptically the sort of corporate dream</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:20.800" style="s2">is that we will stop obsessing over you</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">know the death of little people</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.800" end="00:35:24.480" style="s2">in order for the economic machine to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">back to doing what it does</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.480" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">and um this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.680" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">also therefore a moment for us to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:34.560" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">that we actually are in the same boat</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.560" end="00:35:38.160" style="s2">and you know to the extent all of us you</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">mean all of us right</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.160" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">you&#39;re coughing on somebody because</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:42.880" style="s2">you&#39;re confused about how dangerous this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.880" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">then that cough you may be asymptomatic</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:49.200" style="s2">you may cough on somebody they may</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:50.240" style="s2">transmit it to somebody and somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.200" end="00:35:52.160" style="s2">care about may die</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.240" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">downstream of that you may be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.160" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">to yourself and have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">um yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">um anyway the the the politicization is</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:04.240" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">the um the the frightening thing here</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.240" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">and i and i</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.040" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">we take trump to task we are uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.560" end="00:36:17.839" style="s2">we anger a certain fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.839" end="00:36:22.560" style="s2">otherwise might be listening to us but</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">if there&#39;s one thing that i would say i</p>

<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">broken during his presidency it is his</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.359" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">commitment to the political now you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:34.160" style="s2">he needs to do that because the deep</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.160" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">whatever is so frighteningly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">that this is the this is the only weapon</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">he&#39;s got but</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:44.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t see it that way he is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:47.520" style="s2">politicizing this because it&#39;s the game</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.640" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">he is the master of right he&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.520" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">at that game and you know if i had to</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:52.000" style="s2">bet i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.520" style="s2">he&#39;s going to win 2020 because he is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">very good about it but</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.520" end="00:36:57.440" style="s2">to politicize things at this moment is</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.440" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">to create a tremendous amount of misery</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">and actually we have no way of guessing</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">how much it&#39;s going to be because</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">to the extent that more people get sick</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:09.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">of policies that are dismissive of the</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:15.200" style="s2">that gives the virus more landscape in</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">which to evolve and learn new tricks</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.200" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if this is going to go</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">away in a year but you know we could be</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:21.839" style="s2">stuck with this</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">permanently because it&#39;s learned new</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.839" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">tricks now</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">because his brilliance his genius if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.280" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">will is politics</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">um but he appears to be almost a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">political savant</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">right he is he is so good in this realm</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">and he does not appear to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.640" style="s2">surround himself</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">with advisors who are excellent in other</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.640" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">realms and to keep them</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">stably around him so if if that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">and let&#39;s just don&#39;t throw that out</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">there is a possibility that he&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:53.359" style="s2">of political savant</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">um we&#39;re left</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:57.440" style="s2">we&#39;re left unfortunately in the position</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">that politics is inherently social</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:01.040" style="s2">so just like again just like the social</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.040" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">left uh that is mired the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">left that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">mired in confusion about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">reality and thinks that just by wishing</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">it true</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">they can create 87 sexes in all of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">garbage</p>

<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">changing minds</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.920" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">that can&#39;t go up against a biological</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">reality like a virus</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">effectively he could get lucky he could</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:34.160" style="s2">get unlucky so far it seems like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">mostly gotten unlucky by making the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.160" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">kinds of choices he has against this</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:40.160" style="s2">virus</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s none of none of the things he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.160" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">doing can</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:46.320" style="s2">actually can actually respond directly</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">to it because he&#39;s wielding social tools</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.320" end="00:38:50.400" style="s2">and it it doesn&#39;t care right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">care</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.400" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">about whether or not he changes people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:59.280" style="s2">attitudes towards him and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s going to make it more powerful if</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.280" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">you know if if when lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">eases with lockdown easing</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">people are taking off their masks</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">because they think that masks make you</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">sheep and make you</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">not true not true americans</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s actually going to spread the thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">farther he&#39;s actually going to have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">working on behalf of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">yeah working on behalf of the virus is</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">exactly my thinking as well</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">and i think we don&#39;t have the proper</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">terminology</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">for the component of a hygiene</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">that is socially mediated maybe maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">do have a term and i&#39;m just not thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">of it but</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:43.440" style="s2">the fact is when a person</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:44.560" style="s2">uses the toilet and they do not wash</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.440" end="00:39:47.040" style="s2">their hands</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.560" end="00:39:47.760" style="s2">the chances of them causing themselves a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.040" end="00:39:50.800" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.760" end="00:39:52.720" style="s2">are very close to zero but the chances</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.800" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">of them causing someone else a problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.720" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">are high the thing that causes you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">to wash your hands is the shame</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">of taking that risk</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">which ultimately you know for those of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">us who</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:09.280" style="s2">had the right upbringing i guess it just</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">gets built in and you don&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:11.440" style="s2">it you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">you know of course you wash your hands</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.440" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">and if there&#39;s no opportunity to wash</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">your hands you think i&#39;m gone</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m doing like i&#39;m walking</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:19.280" style="s2">around with these</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">hands and i can&#39;t touch my face exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.280" end="00:40:23.200" style="s2">so um so there&#39;s something that just</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:27.119" style="s2">becomes encoded it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">uh second nature and to have a political</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.119" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">entity whoever it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:32.800" style="s2">right whether you know it&#39;s our</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.880" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">say i&#39;m very conflicted about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">that uh front page with the page of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.800" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">across the country and just chose a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">hundred a hundred a thousand names</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know exactly how they did it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">they didn&#39;t quite clarify um but they</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">i think they tried to choose across</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">various demographics geographic</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">sex race socioeconomics age especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:16.079" style="s2">um and they just listed</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">is by most measures still probably the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">biggest newspaper in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">yeah um so it was impressive it was hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">to ignore</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">well and it was an obvious allusion to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.560" style="s2">what happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">in a smaller disaster right an airline</p>

<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">list of the victims of the crash and</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.079" style="s2">often there&#39;ll be pictures</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.920" style="s2">after 9 11 they they did this i would</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.079" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">say actually it&#39;s an allusion to war</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.920" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">because you know pandemic and war are</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.760" style="s2">are sister ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">yeah i hadn&#39;t thought of it and and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.760" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">you know they come at you unexpected in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">um there&#39;s something in here i want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">read a little bit more but not right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.319" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:14.800" style="s2">um i i think it&#39;s been a long time since</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.319" end="00:45:16.960" style="s2">i read</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.800" end="00:45:18.560" style="s2">camus the plague but this essay by</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.960" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">williams reminded me of it and i believe</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.560" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">that he</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">he makes that connection that um one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">the things about both</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:26.640" style="s2">is that you don&#39;t see it coming there</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">are people with glimmers</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.640" end="00:45:29.839" style="s2">glimmerings of it and there are people</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">who are preparing</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.839" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">and there are people who are mocking the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:35.440" style="s2">ones preparing yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:36.640" style="s2">but when it&#39;s finally at your door it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.440" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">basically too late</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.640" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">to do any of the work that you might</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:44.240" style="s2">have done in advance yeah it does</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:47.440" style="s2">uh the even the style of the front page</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.240" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">um looked like a memorial wall</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.440" end="00:45:51.440" style="s2">with just the endless list of names and</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">not very much information</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.440" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">but there was something about it that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t sit quite right with me</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.680" style="s2">so on the one hand i think it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">important</p>

<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">a week is this the equivalent of if we</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">take all of the people the excess debts</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:11.119" style="s2">how many airline crashes a week is it on</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">the other hand i find something very</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.119" end="00:46:16.079" style="s2">disingenuous about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">that changes in policy very</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.079" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">frequently kill an airline airliner</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">worth of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">relatively quickly right we just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.720" style="s2">know who they are and we don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">now we should care but we don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.720" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:32.319" style="s2">and if we did start caring at that level</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.079" style="s2">we&#39;d be overwhelmed by it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.319" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">the fact that this is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.079" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">easing environmental regulations</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">that cause more particulate matter to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">in the air in a particular place such</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">that more</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">children end up with uh later in adults</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">coming down with lung cancer</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">there&#39;s no way to track it for sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">right you just you you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">know if any individual case of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:52.560" style="s2">was due to those changes and regulations</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">early on</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.560" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">but too probabilistic yeah um so we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:58.000" style="s2">say this number</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">died we can&#39;t say who they were because</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.000" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">even that can&#39;t be established or</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">things that create jeopardy that result</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.119" end="00:47:06.800" style="s2">the thing that you were pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:08.640" style="s2">about um the way people&#39;s lives are</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.800" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">hooked up</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">people a lot of people are close to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">bottom of the ladder</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">where if you fall just one rung too low</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to get back onto it i</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">mean once once you&#39;ve become homeless</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">right once it&#39;s hard to get a shower</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">once you don&#39;t have multiple sets of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">clothes and can&#39;t get them clean right</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:32.000" style="s2">even if you had the skills to keep a job</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to get one</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.000" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">right so anyway how many people policies</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:42.079" style="s2">cruel with respect to taking people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">misfortune and allowing it to plague</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.079" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">them for the rest of their life and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">shortening those lives by leaving them</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">uh exposed to the elements these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">kill a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t get a new york times front</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:55.119" style="s2">page listing their names</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">just because they died so there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.119" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:48:02.400" style="s2">i think the new york times is</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">broadcasting these names to give us a</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.400" end="00:48:07.280" style="s2">sense of the magnitude of this crisis</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:09.280" style="s2">and that is legitimate but in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.280" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">it invites a question about what else we</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.280" end="00:48:13.119" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">that is creating uh you know death and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.119" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">misery</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">needlessly and what role good governance</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">would play in preventing it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">you know we talked in our last live</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">stream about</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:27.119" style="s2">why the term progressive is not anathema</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">to us even though many of the things</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.119" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">that modern progressives</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">are advocating are not things we would</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">advocate</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:36.000" style="s2">and the answer is we need progress we</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:38.800" style="s2">are actually in mortal jeopardy if we</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.000" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">don&#39;t find it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">the the point i was trying to get to and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">i think i&#39;ve wandered from it but</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">covet 19 reveals the interconnectedness</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:51.359" style="s2">and the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">of good policy right we are now</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.359" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">all grappling with it in real time</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">because it affects whether or not we can</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2">go out and get a cup of coffee right</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">but those things are in play 24 7</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">365 and decisions are being made</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:09.680" style="s2">on our behalf by people who do not share</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:11.599" style="s2">our interests</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.680" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">and they are having terrible</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.599" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">consequences they are creating</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">tremendous misery for people who did</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">nothing to invite it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">and somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">corporate entity wants to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">covet 19</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:29.359" style="s2">it has a perspective about what</p>

<p begin="00:49:29.359" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">talk about the larger picture which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.079" style="s2">what this reveals about</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">the needless misery and</p>

<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">and the role that good uh enlightened</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.880" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">would look like the the the broad sense</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">realized liberty i don&#39;t realize so</p>

<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">right no no i want people liberate in</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">the same way that i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:06.400" style="s2">uh faa regulations liberate us to travel</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:08.319" style="s2">and that that liberty is worth the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.400" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">draconian regulations that allow</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">want the liberty that comes from the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.040" end="00:50:17.920" style="s2">regulation and frankly i want us to look</p>

<p begin="00:50:21.119" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">is special and that in some sense it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:50:28.800" end="00:50:31.839" style="s2">is because it integrates all the others</p>

<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.040" style="s2">is our great strength as well as our</p>

<p begin="00:51:44.800" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">but pestilences rob us of the sanctuary</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:09.520" style="s2">um they&#39;re in france to go into lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.319" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">with another family so</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.520" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">he&#39;s in the in the countryside in france</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">with two families with young children</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">but still um still enduring what</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.599" style="s2">most of us in the world are enduring and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">the idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.599" end="00:52:27.200" style="s2">that we are all almost</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">all of us living in some moment that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.200" end="00:52:30.880" style="s2">not now</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">is of course an idea that is repeated in</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.880" end="00:52:33.760" style="s2">many spiritual traditions most famously</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.760" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">right and the furthermore the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">a lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:43.359" style="s2">slows time makes it hard to track time</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:46.640" style="s2">makes us</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.359" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">all simply be in the moment for for</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.640" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">for much of it uh you know he he like us</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">um has has no immediate worry about his</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">own ability to feed his family</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.559" style="s2">right he&#39;s concerned about how this how</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">this will play out for him and his</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.559" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">future and his livelihood he does</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">intellectual work and you know all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">this but</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">he&#39;s not worried about being on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">streets or starving for him or his</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">children or his family</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">um so those those concerns aside once</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">you deal with sort of that level of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:22.000" style="s2">maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">learning how to be present</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.000" end="00:53:27.280" style="s2">with yourself to take in the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:30.160" style="s2">information around you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.280" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">is actually completely excruciating for</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.160" end="00:53:34.400" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:36.160" style="s2">and it is not something that especially</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.400" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">given the ghost of the machine that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.160" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">social media which is where you started</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:42.720" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">um but most people</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.720" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">by age adults seem to know how to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">to to be comfortable satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">being with themselves in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.720" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">certainty about what will come and this</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.720" end="00:54:02.240" style="s2">is something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:05.839" style="s2">we need to become able to at least</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.240" end="00:54:05.839" style="s2">try to be in that space</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">all right several several things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.079" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">follow from that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:12.400" style="s2">um one i do think there&#39;s something very</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">rich</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.400" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">in the idea that a plague</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:21.280" style="s2">forces you um</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.559" style="s2">into some moment that has contracted</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.280" end="00:54:25.200" style="s2">from both sides</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.559" end="00:54:26.240" style="s2">right because the relevance of the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.200" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">you used to live</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.240" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">is not clear and where you&#39;re headed is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">not clear and so you are sort of forced</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:35.839" style="s2">into this</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">very narrow slice and it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.839" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">very jarring i think for all of us and</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:41.839" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.480" style="s2">i feel compelled to say as terrible as</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.839" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.480" end="00:54:45.760" style="s2">you and i are um just because of the way</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:48.000" style="s2">we have</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.760" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">chosen to prioritize things in our life</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.000" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">we&#39;re very well situated</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">not for this not to drive us crazy i</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:55.680" style="s2">think it&#39;s still driving us a little</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">crazy but no totally but we have birds</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.680" end="00:54:59.680" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ve got birds and lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.680" end="00:55:03.440" style="s2">but as a proxy for everything else</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">that&#39;s here right right</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.440" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">but um on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">this ghost in the machine and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:10.880" style="s2">machine i&#39;m talking about is not the</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.400" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.880" end="00:55:15.200" style="s2">the machine i&#39;m talking about is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:15.599" style="s2">natural process that human beings use to</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.200" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">tune</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.599" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">into each other&#39;s thinking in order to</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">navigate novel circumstances like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">very odd pandemic yes right that machine</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.000" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">has a bug in it and the bug is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:30.160" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">it&#39;s the platforms and their perspective</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.160" end="00:55:33.599" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">frankly absurd perspective that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.599" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">understand well enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">what the borders of reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">discussion are that they get to</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">intervene</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s troubling enough</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:46.400" style="s2">when they do this in plain sight and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">know for example that they&#39;ve tossed</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.400" end="00:55:49.680" style="s2">you know megan murphy off of twitter</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:50.400" style="s2">because she thinks men and women are two</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.680" end="00:55:53.520" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.400" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">right that we can see and we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.520" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">mock it enough that at least we retain</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">that piece of sanity right</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">many of us get that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">different things and that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">absurd to banish somebody for saying so</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">but what we can&#39;t see are the subtle</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">biases right where they just put a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:12.960" style="s2">little shackle around the ankle of some</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:13.440" style="s2">idea that they don&#39;t like and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.960" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.440" end="00:56:16.480" style="s2">the problem is often they will do this</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.480" end="00:56:19.599" style="s2">intentioned now it&#39;s still naive to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:21.760" style="s2">think that they know</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.599" end="00:56:23.680" style="s2">what to shack what ideas to liberate and</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.760" end="00:56:27.200" style="s2">amplify and what ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.680" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">to uh to slow down but they will also do</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.200" end="00:56:30.880" style="s2">it when they have a conflict of interest</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.119" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">because once they&#39;ve built the mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.880" end="00:56:34.240" style="s2">that corrupts thinking in a direction</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">that they think would be</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.240" end="00:56:38.319" style="s2">noble then they have the tools to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:38.960" style="s2">corrupt thinking in a direction that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.319" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">lucrative</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.960" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s no process by which that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:44.799" style="s2">going to result</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">in them doing only those things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.799" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">they see are honorable bad as that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:54.079" style="s2">they will do both and so to what extent</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.599" end="00:56:56.960" style="s2">are we out in the world trying to</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.079" end="00:56:59.599" style="s2">navigate this very confusing situation</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.960" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">ending up coughing on each other or</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.599" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">shouting at somebody as if they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">animal to get them out of a supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:09.359" style="s2">to what extent is this the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">of the fact that our natural conscious</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.359" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">process is corrupted</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">by this economic process on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">that has effects on our thinking that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">can&#39;t begin to fathom</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:22.960" style="s2">well i think you and i are in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:25.440" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.960" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">and no we can&#39;t fully fathom it but i</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.440" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">will say</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">i know for sure that when</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:40.160" style="s2">i have allowed myself to be free</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:40.960" style="s2">of this ghost these ghosts in this</p>

<p begin="00:57:40.960" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">or these machines for you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.000" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it hasn&#39;t happened for more than a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:49.599" style="s2">couple of weeks at a time</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">in recent years back when we were doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:52.559" style="s2">field research</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:54.160" style="s2">my field site as you know because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.559" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">were there for one of my field seasons</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.160" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:57:58.559" style="s2">was completely remote and this was</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">before internet was was</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.559" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">much you know this was late 90s but</p>

<p begin="00:58:10.559" end="00:58:13.599" style="s2">so really everyone was showering in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:17.200" style="s2">waterfall</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.599" end="00:58:21.200" style="s2">um spending days hiking the forest and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.200" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">marking and studying frogs super remote</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.200" end="00:58:25.119" style="s2">and it brings you it just focuses you to</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:26.640" style="s2">this</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.359" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">since basically since we started</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">happened you know very quickly one after</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.480" end="00:58:58.000" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve managed to do um several week</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.000" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">study abroad and we did this final 11</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:03.520" style="s2">week study abroad which still</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:06.240" style="s2">because we were to hub in and out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.520" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">quito we would only have a week</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.240" end="00:59:10.400" style="s2">uh really 10 days at the most without</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:11.760" style="s2">any connection to the internet and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.400" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">back again</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:16.880" style="s2">but even those 10 days is enough to</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">remind you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.880" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">how different your brain looks when</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">you&#39;re not constantly being dragged</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">by forces that are actually economic</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:28.880" style="s2">and we had this experience most recently</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:31.040" style="s2">in january of this year which i</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.880" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">cannot believe that was this year but</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.040" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">when you know when we were</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:36.640" style="s2">actually back in the most remote spot in</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:38.880" style="s2">the ecuadorian amazon that</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.640" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">um that i&#39;ve seen and it&#39;s extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.880" end="00:59:42.799" style="s2">and we were</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:43.839" style="s2">tippatini for what 12 days which has no</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.799" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.839" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">and it was glorious</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:53.599" style="s2">it was but um many various things to say</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.799" style="s2">one is when we used to go to madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.599" end="00:59:55.760" style="s2">and i was only there for one field</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.799" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">season but we</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.760" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">i went three times yes four times um we</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:03.359" style="s2">used to</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:05.920" style="s2">tell our families you&#39;ll see us in</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.359" end="01:00:06.640" style="s2">three months yeah you know and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.920" end="01:00:08.720" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.640" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">can you please arrange to call us at</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.720" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">some point in the middle and we would</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">say no because it was so</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">difficult to actually make a phone call</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">off the island at that point</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">that even you know if we stood in line</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">at the telephone office</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">we might wait an hour and it might not</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:26.079" style="s2">work anyway so we just wouldn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">however the problem is that the ghost in</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.079" end="01:00:29.440" style="s2">the machine</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">is growing more powerful and more</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.440" end="01:00:34.160" style="s2">mysterious by the hour</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:34.720" style="s2">and so even the difference you know i</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.160" end="01:00:37.440" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.720" end="01:00:38.000" style="s2">i used to love taking students to dry</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.440" end="01:00:41.040" style="s2">falls</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.000" end="01:00:42.480" style="s2">in eastern washington and at first it</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.040" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">was very hard to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.480" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">cell service out there which was great</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:47.359" style="s2">because all the students whether they</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">liked it or not were liberated from this</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.359" end="01:00:51.040" style="s2">corruption and then it crept in but for</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:52.640" style="s2">a little while</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.040" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">uh you could only get cell services if</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.640" end="01:00:56.160" style="s2">you climbed on top of some</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">some difficult to climb rocks so it sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.160" end="01:00:59.119" style="s2">of enforced</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">enforced a little bit of interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.119" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">physical risk-taking to</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">get your cell service that you wanted so</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:05.520" style="s2">badly yes and then very stupid</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:07.760" style="s2">risk-taking because you&#39;re standing on</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.520" end="01:01:09.200" style="s2">top of some rock outcropping on a cell</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.760" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">phone and it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.200" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">absent-mindedly</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">lose track of where you are and and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:15.119" style="s2">could be terrible but which</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:17.839" style="s2">never happened never happened but it</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.119" end="01:01:20.880" style="s2">could have um but you know i will say</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.839" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">you know i i&#39;m almost embarrassed for</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.880" end="01:01:23.359" style="s2">planet earth to report the following</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.359" end="01:01:26.880" style="s2">but our last trip to tipputini</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:30.000" style="s2">completely broke</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.880" end="01:01:31.599" style="s2">our connection to the world as we knew</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.000" end="01:01:34.240" style="s2">that it would</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.599" end="01:01:35.040" style="s2">that said there is a canopy tower that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.240" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">sticks up</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.040" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">from this literally the most diverse</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:40.559" style="s2">habitat on earth</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">about as remote as you can get there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:44.079" style="s2">canopy tower it&#39;s about 130 feet in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.119" style="s2">air i think yep</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.079" end="01:01:50.079" style="s2">except above the canopy and</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.119" end="01:01:52.480" style="s2">employees of the field station could</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.079" end="01:01:53.119" style="s2">contact their families by climbing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.480" end="01:01:54.400" style="s2">tower</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.119" end="01:01:56.079" style="s2">and you know they had to have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.400" end="01:01:57.839" style="s2">particular cell phone carrier there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.079" end="01:01:59.680" style="s2">one antenna that was just</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.839" end="01:02:00.880" style="s2">barely in range and you know for them i</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.680" end="01:02:02.240" style="s2">get it they&#39;re staying in touch with</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.880" end="01:02:02.640" style="s2">their families it makes total sense to</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.240" end="01:02:04.000" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.640" end="01:02:05.359" style="s2">these are guys who are working i mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.000" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">they&#39;re being well treated by the field</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.359" end="01:02:08.960" style="s2">station but they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">what i think it&#39;s like it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.960" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">like three weeks on one week off so they</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">get to see their families one week a</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:16.319" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s let&#39;s you know a many hour</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.319" end="01:02:18.799" style="s2">boat ride</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">up the river to see them it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.799" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">they can just pop in yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:26.559" style="s2">so i get it but and yet</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:27.440" style="s2">yet the point is you&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.559" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">safe from</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.440" end="01:02:30.960" style="s2">this menace to your thinking anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.960" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">and even if you can make yourself you</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:36.559" style="s2">know you can with discipline</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">break your connection to it in order to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.559" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">figure out how you independently think</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:40.960" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.119" style="s2">isolation from it but the problem is if</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.960" end="01:02:45.839" style="s2">civilization is being driven crazy</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.119" end="01:02:47.280" style="s2">by its connection then how much good</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.839" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">does it do you to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.280" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">sane in the midst of this spreading</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">insanity</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">all right um let&#39;s see there were a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.039" end="01:03:00.559" style="s2">couple other things</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:03:01.440" style="s2">i wanted to discuss but maybe uh we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.559" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">leave them</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.440" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">for another time uh yeah i mean i guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:10.079" style="s2">the one that&#39;s relevant here</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">is i heard uh a friend pointed me to</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.079" end="01:03:14.079" style="s2">joe rogan&#39;s conversation with david</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:15.839" style="s2">pakman</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.079" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">and in that conversation they wrestle</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.839" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">with the question of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">uh david is reporting that he was out on</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:24.160" style="s2">his bike or maybe running or maybe both</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:24.799" style="s2">and same time probably not at the same</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.160" end="01:03:27.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.799" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">um but anyway he was reporting how he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.200" end="01:03:30.960" style="s2">using his mask and basically he&#39;s ended</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:33.599" style="s2">up somewhere like you and i have where</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.960" end="01:03:35.200" style="s2">you know yes masks he has it with him</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.599" end="01:03:36.079" style="s2">when he&#39;s outside but he&#39;s not wearing</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.200" end="01:03:38.319" style="s2">it unless</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.079" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">someone comes real close yeah or not</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.319" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">when he&#39;s biking hard or something like</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">and rogan uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">is disbelieving of the evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.880" end="01:03:50.400" style="s2">actually this is difficult to transmit</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">outdoors and so his point is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.400" end="01:03:54.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any reason why droplets</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t um be dangerous to you if</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.400" end="01:03:56.960" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:58.960" style="s2">walking behind somebody runs by you and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.960" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">they exhale some droplets why shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.960" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">that be as dangerous as anything else</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">and i think that this is emblematic of</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:08.319" style="s2">exactly where we are</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:10.559" style="s2">right first of all rogan&#39;s instinct</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.319" end="01:04:11.760" style="s2">is exactly your in my instinct this</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.559" end="01:04:13.599" style="s2">ought to be true</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.760" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">the fact that it is apparently not true</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.599" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t so surprising to us because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">spent a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">complex systems and biology and this</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:21.920" style="s2">kind of surprise</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s the norm right things</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.920" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">that don&#39;t behave the way you expect</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:26.480" style="s2">them to behave</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">you know you look at a tropical forest</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.480" end="01:04:30.000" style="s2">and you think look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.839" end="01:04:31.839" style="s2">all of this diversity and growth this</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.000" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">must be tremendously rich soil</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.839" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">no incredibly poor soil in general right</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:38.559" style="s2">huh how does such poor soil give rise to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:41.280" style="s2">such</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.559" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">beautiful and aggressive diversity on</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.280" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">top of it well actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">like all paradoxes it&#39;s not a real</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:48.400" style="s2">paradox the forest</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">is what it is and it has sucked the</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.400" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">nutrients out of the soil leaving it</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">barren right the competitors are so</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">strong that they&#39;ve depleted the soil</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">that&#39;s the answer but</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:05:01.359" style="s2">in any case to joe&#39;s point this ought to</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">be dangerous to us outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.359" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">apparently it isn&#39;t if the data and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:08.880" style="s2">data comes from multiple sources now</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">if the data is what we think it is then</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.880" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">it is apparently at the moment still</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">very difficult to transmit outdoors</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">we ought to cherish that and protect it</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">disrupt it by treating it carelessly but</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">i think watching joe wrestle with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:27.599" style="s2">complexity of this</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:29.190" style="s2">joe you and i had a lot of experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.599" end="01:05:30.720" style="s2">with students</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.190" end="01:05:34.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.720" end="01:05:35.839" style="s2">in various classes joe is like</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.000" end="01:05:37.440" style="s2">the ultimate student right he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:39.920" style="s2">hungry to understand things</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.440" end="01:05:41.359" style="s2">he&#39;s very broadly experienced he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.920" end="01:05:44.400" style="s2">nothing to prove</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.359" end="01:05:47.039" style="s2">right very good at thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.400" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">joe rogan is becoming confused about</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.039" end="01:05:52.000" style="s2">covet 19.</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">why is he becoming confused i think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.000" end="01:05:56.640" style="s2">becoming confused because there is</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">so much of this politics and it is</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.640" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">infused into the ghost</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:02.400" style="s2">in all of our machines and it is making</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:04.079" style="s2">it impossible for people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.400" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">in general do a very good job of</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.079" end="01:06:07.039" style="s2">thinking carefully to figure out what to</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.039" end="01:06:10.720" style="s2">and what to dismiss it&#39;s doing it to all</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">of us you and me included</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.720" end="01:06:15.599" style="s2">so anyway i just think there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:17.359" style="s2">which joe</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.599" end="01:06:18.799" style="s2">obviously in some sense is the most</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.359" end="01:06:22.480" style="s2">important media voice</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.799" end="01:06:23.280" style="s2">in the world his uh decision to move to</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.480" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">spotify</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.280" end="01:06:26.640" style="s2">is obviously not unrelated to this in</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:29.200" style="s2">fact if we are to take</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.640" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">what alex jones reported about what joe</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.200" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">said to him</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:33.359" style="s2">about why he was leaving youtube and</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:36.480" style="s2">going to spotify</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.359" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">um this is about the corruption</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.480" end="01:06:41.920" style="s2">and the danger of the power that google</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">holds over all of us right so this is in</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.920" end="01:06:46.480" style="s2">some sense a rejection</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">of the ghost in the machine and i must</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.480" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.319" style="s2">in that light i&#39;m hopeful that actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:51.200" style="s2">joe is going to accomplish what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.319" end="01:06:53.760" style="s2">setting out</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.200" end="01:06:55.359" style="s2">to accomplish i&#39;m hopeful and i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.760" end="01:06:56.960" style="s2">it&#39;s actually more plausible than it</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.359" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">might seem</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.960" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">but that also leaves us with what to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:04.559" style="s2">today dealing with this corruption of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">our thinking</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.559" end="01:07:09.200" style="s2">watching even those who in general help</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:10.960" style="s2">us navigate the complex</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.200" end="01:07:12.480" style="s2">failing to do a good job of it because</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.960" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">there&#39;s just too much pollution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.480" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the amount of gravity that</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">whatever force we&#39;re dealing with has to</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:20.079" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">and um you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.079" end="01:07:24.319" style="s2">you and i have been arguing the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.000" end="01:07:24.880" style="s2">danger to us is the politicization of</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.319" end="01:07:28.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.880" end="01:07:32.319" style="s2">crisis i think um</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.400" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">that is turning into a prophetic concern</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.319" end="01:07:37.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s not too late but it will be too</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:38.480" style="s2">late if we don&#39;t do something about it</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.440" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">quickly so</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.480" end="01:07:44.799" style="s2">especially given that this particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">weird perspective that the virus isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.799" end="01:07:48.319" style="s2">as serious as we think and masks aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">necessary that that appears to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.319" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">a largely american confusion</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:55.440" style="s2">let&#39;s take a step back and think about</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">how to be good to each other</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.440" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">and how to reason through this together</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll come out of it stronger</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.960" end="01:08:08.000" style="s2">okay so we&#39;ve reached the end of</p>
