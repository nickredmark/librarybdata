<p begin="00:00:03.899" end="00:00:13.380" style="s2">drift so I need to tell you a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:17.130" style="s2">history first back in I think 1979 the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.380" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">very famous paleontologists Stephen Jay</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:24.420" style="s2">Gould and his less famous very important</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:27.720" style="s2">geneticists but less publicly famous</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.420" end="00:00:31.109" style="s2">geneticist friend Richard Lewin ttan</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.720" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">published a very famous paper about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.109" end="00:00:40.160" style="s2">field of evolutionary biology paper is</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:45.239" style="s2">called the spandrels of San Marcos and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.160" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">it is about an architectural analogy for</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.239" end="00:00:49.590" style="s2">things that are seen in creatures and it</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">made a very forceful argument paper</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.590" end="00:00:55.140" style="s2">argued that evolutionary biologists were</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">getting carried away with explanations</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.140" end="00:01:01.710" style="s2">that were adaptive and the point was</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:03.809" style="s2">that in this Cathedral there were these</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.710" end="00:01:05.390" style="s2">things called spandrels and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.809" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">spandrels had these very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.390" end="00:01:10.140" style="s2">pictures in them that made it seem like</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">the spandrels had been created to house</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.140" end="00:01:15.229" style="s2">these pictures I think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:17.880" style="s2">famous rotunda that has four pillars</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.229" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">underneath this dome and each of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.880" end="00:01:22.770" style="s2">pillars has a triangular spandrel that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.780" style="s2">it creates and the four spandrels have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.770" end="00:01:26.520" style="s2">been filled in with maybe they&#39;re Saints</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.780" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">that represent different rivers or</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.520" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">something like that it all looks like</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">the spandrels are there for this very</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.070" style="s2">important purpose Gould and Lou Anton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">argument was of the spandrels are</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.070" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">actually an architectural accident of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:42.360" style="s2">what happens when you put a dome on top</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">of pillars now this is not inherently</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.360" end="00:01:48.479" style="s2">true but even if we grant that part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:50.100" style="s2">the puzzle their argument had a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.479" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">disastrous effect on evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.100" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">biology it had a degree of truth in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.140" end="00:01:58.469" style="s2">there was a tendency amongst</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:02:01.189" style="s2">evolutionists to gravitate in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.469" end="00:02:01.189" style="s2">direction of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.540" end="00:02:06.860" style="s2">explanations for traits of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.770" end="00:02:08.630" style="s2">that seemed right in spite of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.860" end="00:02:11.480" style="s2">that there wasn&#39;t sufficient evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.630" end="00:02:16.880" style="s2">know that these explanations were right</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.480" end="00:02:19.190" style="s2">but what they said was look that</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.880" end="00:02:22.300" style="s2">adaptations arise because you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.190" end="00:02:25.190" style="s2">genetic variation and because selection</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.300" end="00:02:26.660" style="s2">favors certain variants over others so</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.190" end="00:02:28.300" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna claim that something is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.660" end="00:02:33.110" style="s2">an adaptation you should demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.300" end="00:02:35.390" style="s2">that the state that you wish to claim is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.110" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">adaptive is actually superior to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.390" end="00:02:39.080" style="s2">alternative states this all seems very</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:42.320" style="s2">reasonable and conservative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.080" end="00:02:44.600" style="s2">actually insane right when we get to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.320" end="00:02:44.990" style="s2">creature very frequently the race is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.600" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.990" end="00:02:51.800" style="s2">whatever selective advantage the trait</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:52.910" style="s2">had is gone because all of the creatures</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.800" end="00:02:54.650" style="s2">have it so you have what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.910" end="00:02:56.810" style="s2">fixation where every creature has the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.650" end="00:03:00.410" style="s2">trait in question and there&#39;s nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.810" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">measure so that&#39;s one problem I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.410" end="00:03:05.090" style="s2">that which remains becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:07.280" style="s2">definition of the creature anyway it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.090" end="00:03:12.340" style="s2">does but I mean look just take a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.280" end="00:03:15.050" style="s2">example your heart has four chambers</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.340" end="00:03:17.510" style="s2">it&#39;s quite clear that a four chambered</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.050" end="00:03:20.030" style="s2">heart has advantages in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.510" end="00:03:22.489" style="s2">efficiency because it isolates the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.030" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">oxygenated blood from that that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.489" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">depleted there&#39;s no doubt that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:31.489" style="s2">why it evolved even if there were humans</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.660" end="00:03:34.190" style="s2">that occasionally had that variance and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.489" end="00:03:35.810" style="s2">even if you had the budget to find the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.190" end="00:03:38.200" style="s2">genes responsible for the difference</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.810" end="00:03:41.239" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about an immense</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.200" end="00:03:43.610" style="s2">investment in research to prove</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.239" end="00:03:45.890" style="s2">something that&#39;s utterly obvious which</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.610" end="00:03:48.970" style="s2">is that keeping the oxygenated blood</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.890" end="00:03:51.860" style="s2">separate from the depleted blood has</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.970" end="00:03:55.790" style="s2">efficiency advantages so when I got to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.860" end="00:03:57.110" style="s2">graduate school I became frustrated by</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:04:00.769" style="s2">the fact that Gould and Lou Anton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.110" end="00:04:02.269" style="s2">argument was still live and that many of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.769" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">the people I was interacting with took</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:06.760" style="s2">it as an important set of criteria</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">whereas other people I dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.760" end="00:04:10.510" style="s2">understood that they needed to simply</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:13.209" style="s2">ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.510" end="00:04:17.650" style="s2">this was not satisfying to me I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.209" end="00:04:20.199" style="s2">to come up with a logically robust way</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.650" end="00:04:23.860" style="s2">to neutralize the part of that argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.199" end="00:04:29.020" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t real and so I did when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.860" end="00:04:33.699" style="s2">came up with was a test and the test has</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.020" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">four parts and it allows you to restore</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.699" end="00:04:39.760" style="s2">the burden of proof to the way it should</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">logically be so Luton and Gould had</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.760" end="00:04:43.330" style="s2">reversed the burden of proof and</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:45.430" style="s2">basically set a very high bar for</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.330" end="00:04:47.139" style="s2">claiming of the traits that an organism</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.430" end="00:04:50.710" style="s2">has are the product of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.139" end="00:04:52.870" style="s2">evolution my point was actually almost</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.710" end="00:04:55.650" style="s2">every trait you could name of a creature</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.870" end="00:04:57.639" style="s2">is the product of adaptive evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.650" end="00:04:59.139" style="s2">so it shouldn&#39;t have a high bar</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.639" end="00:05:03.820" style="s2">logically speaking it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.139" end="00:05:06.220" style="s2">evolution is formally defined as changes</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.820" end="00:05:11.770" style="s2">in gene frequency within a population</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.220" end="00:05:16.360" style="s2">over time that process evolution can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.770" end="00:05:18.130" style="s2">caused by various things it can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.360" end="00:05:24.250" style="s2">caused by creatures migrating into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.130" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">landscape leaving a landscape dying or</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.250" end="00:05:27.760" style="s2">it can be caused by the fact that within</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">that landscape selection of favors</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.760" end="00:05:32.650" style="s2">certainly genetic variance over others</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:38.050" style="s2">so only that last one creates adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.650" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">evolution the only process that creates</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.050" end="00:05:42.460" style="s2">anything meaningful is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.940" end="00:05:45.849" style="s2">evolution drift can certainly change</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.460" end="00:05:48.490" style="s2">gene frequencies but it can&#39;t create a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.849" end="00:05:50.620" style="s2">wing or an eye or almost anything you</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.490" end="00:05:53.099" style="s2">could name and by meaningful you mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.620" end="00:05:56.169" style="s2">something that persists and then games</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.099" end="00:05:58.389" style="s2">definitive of this organism no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.169" end="00:06:00.639" style="s2">something you could name there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.389" end="00:06:02.650" style="s2">examples of things you could name that</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.639" end="00:06:03.849" style="s2">don&#39;t have any adaptive meaning but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.650" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">actually have to work a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.849" end="00:06:07.740" style="s2">find them and I&#39;ll let me come to some</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:12.070" style="s2">example so that you can see what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.740" end="00:06:15.250" style="s2">the test that I came up with involved</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.070" end="00:06:17.349" style="s2">four criteria if all four criteria are</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.250" end="00:06:20.020" style="s2">met you are logically justified in</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.349" end="00:06:21.830" style="s2">assuming that adaptive evolution is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.020" end="00:06:24.919" style="s2">explanation unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.830" end="00:06:27.850" style="s2">countervailing evidence arises so the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.919" end="00:06:30.979" style="s2">four characteristics are complexity</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.850" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">complexity is only created at high</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.979" end="00:06:37.070" style="s2">degrees by adaptive evolution in the non</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:39.229" style="s2">adaptive part of the universe there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.070" end="00:06:42.020" style="s2">nothing highly complex there are some</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.229" end="00:06:45.620" style="s2">curious things there are some structured</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.020" end="00:06:49.340" style="s2">things but complexity is different the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.620" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">second criterion is that the trait in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.340" end="00:06:56.720" style="s2">question has to have a cost that cost</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:58.430" style="s2">can be in terms of materials or it could</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.720" end="00:07:02.330" style="s2">be a cost in terms of risk that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:04.190" style="s2">organism takes but some cost that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.330" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">organism would be better off not paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.190" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">if it weren&#39;t of some value the third</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">characteristic is that there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:16.610" style="s2">variation in the amount of cost that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:18.770" style="s2">spent so that creatures that spend less</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.610" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">would have a competitive advantage over</p>

<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:29.750" style="s2">is persistence over evolutionary time if</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.330" end="00:07:33.340" style="s2">a trait is complex that suggests</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.750" end="00:07:37.220" style="s2">adaptive evolution if it has a cost and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:39.740" style="s2">that cost varies and yet creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.220" end="00:07:41.900" style="s2">pay the cost are not being out competed</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.740" end="00:07:44.060" style="s2">by creatures that save on the cost over</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.900" end="00:07:47.000" style="s2">evolutionary time that suggests of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.060" end="00:07:50.660" style="s2">trait in whatever way is paying for</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.000" end="00:07:53.389" style="s2">itself that is the core piece of logic</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.660" end="00:07:56.150" style="s2">that allows us to presume that some</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.389" end="00:07:56.879" style="s2">trait is the consequence of adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.150" end="00:08:00.509" style="s2">evolution</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.879" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">so if we look at the plant and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.509" end="00:08:06.629" style="s2">discover that the green color of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:07.619" style="s2">grass is the result of a pigment</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.629" end="00:08:11.009" style="s2">molecule</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.619" end="00:08:13.529" style="s2">well the pigment molecule is complex as</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.009" end="00:08:17.249" style="s2">is the metabolic process that creates it</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.529" end="00:08:18.689" style="s2">the pigment molecule is costly it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.249" end="00:08:20.189" style="s2">out of materials that the grass could</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.689" end="00:08:26.149" style="s2">use for something else if it wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.189" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">it is variable the degree to which a</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.149" end="00:08:33.569" style="s2">plant invests in chlorophyll varies some</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:35.789" style="s2">produce more per unit of volume of leaf</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.569" end="00:08:37.560" style="s2">some produce less and it persists over</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.789" end="00:08:42.750" style="s2">evolutionary time plants continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.560" end="00:08:44.639" style="s2">green now we can say that we can presume</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.750" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">that that molecule and therefore the</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.639" end="00:08:49.709" style="s2">green color of the plants is the result</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">of adaptive evolution the trick is we</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.709" end="00:08:55.470" style="s2">cannot say based on that evidence what</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:58.019" style="s2">the green color is for we can just say</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.470" end="00:09:00.060" style="s2">what process created it now it happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.019" end="00:09:04.230" style="s2">that in the case of the color of plants</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.060" end="00:09:06.660" style="s2">we know what the molecule does molecule</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.230" end="00:09:08.910" style="s2">absorbs light energy and turns it into</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.660" end="00:09:10.380" style="s2">chemical energy which the plant can</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.910" end="00:09:14.339" style="s2">store and deploy for different things</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.380" end="00:09:16.589" style="s2">but there lots of cases in which a trait</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.339" end="00:09:17.250" style="s2">of an organism passes the test but we</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.589" end="00:09:23.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.250" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">for example there&#39;s a an extinct clade</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.160" end="00:09:31.199" style="s2">of creatures called palooka soars</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:33.779" style="s2">amongst them Dimetrodon Dimetrodon and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.199" end="00:09:35.639" style="s2">the other Palicki soars are very</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.779" end="00:09:37.199" style="s2">conspicuous these are creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.639" end="00:09:38.610" style="s2">lived on the earth with the dinosaurs</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.199" end="00:09:42.060" style="s2">they were not dinosaurs but they lived</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.610" end="00:09:45.060" style="s2">at the same time and they had these</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.060" end="00:09:48.540" style="s2">marvelous sails on their backs these big</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.060" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">sails that had bones sticking up to hold</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.540" end="00:09:52.740" style="s2">them open like a giant wing we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:55.259" style="s2">know whether the sails on the back of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.740" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">these animals collected sunlight to warm</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.259" end="00:09:58.680" style="s2">their blood to give them an advantage so</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:01.470" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t have to warm up their</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.680" end="00:10:03.509" style="s2">dense bodies in the sunlight or if they</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.470" end="00:10:06.600" style="s2">deterred predators we can&#39;t say for sure</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.509" end="00:10:08.339" style="s2">now it is possible using fossil evidence</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.600" end="00:10:11.759" style="s2">to answer a question right</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.339" end="00:10:14.639" style="s2">but we should not confuse the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.759" end="00:10:17.939" style="s2">of what is the sale on the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.639" end="00:10:20.819" style="s2">palooka sore for with the question of is</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.939" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">it and adaptation my point would be you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.819" end="00:10:25.470" style="s2">have to separate those two questions</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:27.990" style="s2">it is absolutely obvious that the sale</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.470" end="00:10:30.990" style="s2">on the back of the palooka store is an</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.990" end="00:10:32.550" style="s2">adaptation there&#39;s no way that that sale</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.990" end="00:10:35.670" style="s2">would have ended up on so many species</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.550" end="00:10:36.709" style="s2">that lasted over so many generations if</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.670" end="00:10:39.749" style="s2">it was a waste</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.709" end="00:10:41.309" style="s2">it had to be paying for itself in what</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.749" end="00:10:42.809" style="s2">way was it paying for itself is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.309" end="00:10:44.509" style="s2">separate question a more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.809" end="00:10:47.490" style="s2">question and a more difficult question</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.509" end="00:10:51.240" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if we will ever know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.490" end="00:10:53.009" style="s2">answer for sure but the mistake that Lou</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.240" end="00:10:54.899" style="s2">Anton and Gould caused us to make was to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.009" end="00:10:56.850" style="s2">confuse these two questions where if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.899" end="00:10:58.829" style="s2">couldn&#39;t explain what the sale was for</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.850" end="00:11:00.959" style="s2">we had no justification for claiming it</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.829" end="00:11:03.089" style="s2">was for anything and that&#39;s a logical</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.959" end="00:11:05.930" style="s2">fallacy so let&#39;s take an example that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.089" end="00:11:10.170" style="s2">fails the test if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.930" end="00:11:12.449" style="s2">coloration of naked mole-rats naked</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.170" end="00:11:13.290" style="s2">mole-rats live almost their entire lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.449" end="00:11:15.720" style="s2">underground</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.290" end="00:11:17.999" style="s2">they only very occasionally one</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.720" end="00:11:21.149" style="s2">individual will leave one burrow run</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.999" end="00:11:22.829" style="s2">across the African plains and dive into</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.149" end="00:11:24.209" style="s2">another burrow so they almost never end</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.829" end="00:11:25.879" style="s2">up in the light they&#39;re in the dark for</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.209" end="00:11:31.559" style="s2">their whole lives</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.879" end="00:11:36.689" style="s2">they are almost hairless and they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.559" end="00:11:39.240" style="s2">some kind of gray color now if that grey</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.689" end="00:11:41.249" style="s2">color is the result of a pigment if</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.240" end="00:11:44.189" style="s2">there&#39;s a molecule that makes them gray</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.249" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">well then it passes the adaptive test on</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.189" end="00:11:49.559" style="s2">the other hand if there&#39;s no molecule</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:52.319" style="s2">that makes them gray if they are gray</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.559" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">because being some color doesn&#39;t pay if</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.319" end="00:11:55.110" style="s2">you&#39;re in the dark and so evolution has</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.230" style="s2">economized</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.110" end="00:11:59.459" style="s2">on making a pigment and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.230" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">allowed them to be whatever car you are</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.459" end="00:12:04.679" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got enough pigment then well</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:06.300" style="s2">there&#39;s no cost to being the color they</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.679" end="00:12:09.179" style="s2">are so we can&#39;t say that that color is</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.300" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">adaptive now surely the loss of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.179" end="00:12:12.540" style="s2">color is adaptive and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">incidental that a creature that lives</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.540" end="00:12:16.170" style="s2">where there&#39;s no light happens to be one</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.179" style="s2">that is abandoned making pigments but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.170" end="00:12:19.980" style="s2">from the point of view of saying that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.179" end="00:12:21.420" style="s2">particular color of naked mole-rats</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.980" end="00:12:23.130" style="s2">is adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.420" end="00:12:26.810" style="s2">nope I don&#39;t think we have that evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.130" end="00:12:30.540" style="s2">so my argument is not that this test</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.810" end="00:12:31.710" style="s2">shows us something amazing it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.540" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">shows us something that ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.710" end="00:12:34.500" style="s2">obvious to us something that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:37.380" style="s2">completely obvious to Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.500" end="00:12:39.660" style="s2">incidentally that when a creature spends</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.380" end="00:12:41.790" style="s2">on something okay that it does so for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.660" end="00:12:43.620" style="s2">reason and if it didn&#39;t do so for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.790" end="00:12:45.570" style="s2">reason it would economize and there</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.620" end="00:12:48.060" style="s2">therefore it would reallocate whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.570" end="00:12:50.610" style="s2">materials and energy it was spending on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.060" end="00:12:53.010" style="s2">something else so Darwin was sent a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.610" end="00:12:56.850" style="s2">specimen and a walk in from Madagascar I</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.010" end="00:12:59.850" style="s2">believe he was sent it by Bateman and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.850" end="00:13:03.060" style="s2">was a very spectacular specimen in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.850" end="00:13:06.570" style="s2">sense that this work &#39;add had a very</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.060" end="00:13:09.120" style="s2">long nectar tube like a foot long so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.570" end="00:13:11.940" style="s2">nectar was formed at the bottom of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.120" end="00:13:18.690" style="s2">very long tube that hangs off of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.940" end="00:13:21.930" style="s2">flower and Darwin reasoned there must be</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.690" end="00:13:23.190" style="s2">a moth out there with a tongue long</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.930" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">enough to get to the bottom of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.190" end="00:13:30.570" style="s2">thing otherwise why would this plant</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:33.390" style="s2">make this amazing structure it makes no</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.570" end="00:13:38.100" style="s2">sense for a plant to make a nectary that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.390" end="00:13:40.650" style="s2">can&#39;t be accessed by a pollinator and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.100" end="00:13:44.040" style="s2">did not live to see the answer but in</p>

<p begin="00:14:07.950" end="00:14:12.870" style="s2">makes sense for a plant to invest in a</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.830" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">is a revival of that kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:34.660" style="s2">and the whole idea is that it should</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:35.829" style="s2">free us from the absurd obstacles to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.660" end="00:14:38.259" style="s2">claiming that something is an adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.829" end="00:14:41.350" style="s2">which almost every trait of almost every</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.259" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">creature that you could name is and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.350" end="00:14:45.370" style="s2">reason to free us is not that it is so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.199" style="s2">marvelous to point to all these</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.370" end="00:14:49.230" style="s2">structures and say they&#39;re the product</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.199" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">of adaptive evolution of course they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.230" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">adaptive evolution is the only process</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">that creates high degrees of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:14:56.560" style="s2">in the first place so versus each oh</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:14:58.660" style="s2">yeah so virtually everything you should</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.560" end="00:15:01.449" style="s2">you could name about creatures oughta</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.660" end="00:15:04.389" style="s2">pass this test the purpose of it though</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.449" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">is for us to be able to move on to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.389" end="00:15:09.100" style="s2">interesting question the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">question is the ones that preoccupy me</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.100" end="00:15:18.009" style="s2">and all of my evolutionarily oriented</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:19.689" style="s2">friends are the questions about why what</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.009" end="00:15:21.250" style="s2">is the value of this thing to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.689" end="00:15:25.060" style="s2">creature and sometimes it&#39;s perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.250" end="00:15:27.339" style="s2">obvious as in the case of a chlorophyll</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.060" end="00:15:32.379" style="s2">molecule that&#39;s capturing sunlight and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.339" end="00:15:37.269" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s complex enough to stifle</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.379" end="00:15:39.689" style="s2">us for decades nobody has yet delivered</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.269" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">a compelling explanation for why</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.689" end="00:15:47.189" style="s2">peacocks or peacock spiders or our Birds</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:50.079" style="s2">go through the incredible expense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.189" end="00:15:52.990" style="s2">males demonstrating to female something</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.079" end="00:15:55.120" style="s2">that is of no particular value in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.990" end="00:15:56.920" style="s2">raising of offspring why do females</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.120" end="00:15:59.529" style="s2">require this of males so we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.920" end="00:16:01.860" style="s2">about this in a previous video but the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.529" end="00:16:05.110" style="s2">basic point is look that set of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.860" end="00:16:06.939" style="s2">behaviors that we call lekking passes</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.110" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">the adaptive test does that say what</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.939" end="00:16:10.439" style="s2">it&#39;s for no that&#39;s still an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:14.740" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.439" end="00:16:16.779" style="s2">religion passes the adaptive test it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.740" end="00:16:19.059" style="s2">complex it&#39;s expensive there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.779" end="00:16:22.360" style="s2">variance and how much creature spend on</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.059" end="00:16:24.670" style="s2">it and it lasts over evolutionary time</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:27.250" style="s2">gives the lens an advantage to those</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.670" end="00:16:29.339" style="s2">that write but the point is we want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.250" end="00:16:32.170" style="s2">be liberated from the question of is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.339" end="00:16:34.199" style="s2">adaptive in order to pursue the question</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.170" end="00:16:38.920" style="s2">how could that possibly be adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.199" end="00:16:41.319" style="s2">why would believing in Heaven or Hell or</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.920" end="00:16:43.240" style="s2">deities who are allowable to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.319" end="00:16:43.509" style="s2">your prayers why would that be good for</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.240" end="00:16:45.250" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.509" end="00:16:47.110" style="s2">right it wouldn&#39;t be better for you to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.250" end="00:16:48.320" style="s2">think hey there&#39;s nobody out there I</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.110" end="00:16:50.090" style="s2">better look out for myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.320" end="00:16:51.560" style="s2">first order it sort of seems like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.090" end="00:16:53.420" style="s2">would be the way to go apparently not</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.560" end="00:16:55.490" style="s2">apparently people believe in that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.420" end="00:16:56.990" style="s2">somebody gives a damn about them and is</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.490" end="00:17:01.880" style="s2">watching over them and that if they</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.990" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">happen to end up in some circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.880" end="00:17:04.910" style="s2">they can&#39;t get themselves out of and</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:08.150" style="s2">they&#39;ve kept their account clean with</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.910" end="00:17:09.620" style="s2">you know the the sky god that they will</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.150" end="00:17:14.140" style="s2">end up in some great place forever</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.620" end="00:17:17.150" style="s2">somehow that belief appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.140" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">valuable well that&#39;s a worthy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.150" end="00:17:23.150" style="s2">study how could it be so anyway my point</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:25.070" style="s2">is being freed from the question of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.150" end="00:17:27.949" style="s2">whether or not things are adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.070" end="00:17:30.590" style="s2">leaves us open to study in what way</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.949" end="00:17:33.560" style="s2">things that are obviously adaptive are</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.590" end="00:17:35.060" style="s2">beneficial and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.560" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">interesting stuff in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.060" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">biology happens</p>
