<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.140" style="s2">hey guys this is a very short</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.879" end="00:00:06.509" style="s2">announcement about our first online</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.140" end="00:00:08.490" style="s2">course which is called sense making 101</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.509" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s something that we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.490" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">excited about working on for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:12.690" style="s2">while thinking about it for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:15.780" style="s2">time and then working on it for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.690" end="00:00:18.330" style="s2">while it feels very natural for us to</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.780" end="00:00:20.160" style="s2">move into this area because we&#39;ve always</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.330" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">been talking about the value of practice</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.160" end="00:00:23.760" style="s2">the value of living out some of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:25.769" style="s2">ideas rather than just listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.760" end="00:00:28.260" style="s2">and we&#39;re really excited because we have</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.769" end="00:00:31.140" style="s2">a really great faculty onboard to help</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.260" end="00:00:32.489" style="s2">us teach the course and so yeah you want</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.140" end="00:00:35.250" style="s2">to talk more about what people are going</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.489" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">to learn on sense-making 101 so we put a</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.250" end="00:00:39.000" style="s2">lot of time and thought into designing</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:41.070" style="s2">this course and probably the easiest way</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.000" end="00:00:43.530" style="s2">to describe it is that it moves from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.070" end="00:00:45.629" style="s2">inside out so the more we&#39;ve explored</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.530" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">concepts like sense-making or collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.629" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">intelligence on the channel the more</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:52.350" style="s2">it&#39;s become clear that in order for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">to happen in order for us to have you</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:55.890" style="s2">know emerging conversations or</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">conversations that go somewhere that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.890" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">might not be expecting there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:02.850" style="s2">a toolkit of skills we need to let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">play in that space one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:05.880" style="s2">sovereignty so this is a concept we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">talked about a few times and this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.880" end="00:01:10.590" style="s2">that sense of being connected to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">yourself so having discernment and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.590" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">knowing who I am where I&#39;m going and</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">almost being sufficient to yourself but</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">at the same time being open and</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">receptive to your environment so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">a really core concept because that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:24.659" style="s2">us grounded and then as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:25.740" style="s2">another concept which is the shadow so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.659" end="00:01:27.540" style="s2">the shadow we&#39;ve talked about quite a</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.740" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">lot and that&#39;s the shadow is all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.540" end="00:01:32.009" style="s2">aspects of ourselves that we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">rejecting in some way and why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.009" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">important for this and for sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:36.210" style="s2">is that if there&#39;s some aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">ourselves that were just completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.210" end="00:01:41.400" style="s2">unaware of they come out sideways as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">say so that means that we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.400" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">enter into a genuine authentic dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">because there&#39;s always some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:48.270" style="s2">ourselves we&#39;re not fully bringing into</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:49.829" style="s2">it and so we&#39;re not quite complete so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.270" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">that&#39;s really key that we work through</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.829" end="00:01:53.520" style="s2">that and then as well there&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:55.320" style="s2">of agency so that we know that we are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.520" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">thinking for ourselves moving in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.320" end="00:01:58.500" style="s2">direction that we&#39;re choosing and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:01.049" style="s2">once we&#39;ve got these kind of inner</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.500" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">skills we can start expanding it out so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.049" end="00:02:05.219" style="s2">then we start looking at sense making so</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.530" style="s2">looking at how do I make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.219" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">world how do I discern by myself and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.530" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">then how do I do that with others</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">there&#39;s two quite different things for</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">me to have a sense of okay I&#39;ve done my</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">research I know</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:17.970" style="s2">I&#39;m being discerning when I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:19.290" style="s2">safe you know news online but when we</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.970" end="00:02:21.420" style="s2">come together and start trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.290" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">sense of the world together lots of new</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.420" end="00:02:26.310" style="s2">dynamics come out it becomes a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">complex so to do that we have we have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.310" end="00:02:30.390" style="s2">look at okay how do group dynamics works</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:32.040" style="s2">how does inter relation work and how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.390" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">we come in and out of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.040" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">what&#39;s that process like so we become</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.330" end="00:02:37.170" style="s2">skilled at that as well and then we</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:38.970" style="s2">start looking even further taking</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.170" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">another step back and looking at what</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.970" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">are the value structures we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">within what&#39;s our environment what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:46.290" style="s2">the wider systems that play so the hope</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">is and our intention is that we go on</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.290" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">that journey from the inside to the out</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:51.300" style="s2">and we develop a lot of core skills</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:53.190" style="s2">along the way that we can then bring</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.300" end="00:02:55.320" style="s2">into our lives yeah and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.190" end="00:02:57.180" style="s2">important to say that we&#39;ve been running</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.320" end="00:02:59.580" style="s2">retreats together like we both train</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.180" end="00:03:00.690" style="s2">ders as counselors a couple of years ago</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.580" end="00:03:02.430" style="s2">we&#39;ve been running retreat together</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.690" end="00:03:03.630" style="s2">mainly men&#39;s retreats this is not going</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.430" end="00:03:06.210" style="s2">to be a men only course it&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.630" end="00:03:08.010" style="s2">mixed course and so we&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.210" end="00:03:09.480" style="s2">experience with doing that in real life</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.010" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">and now we&#39;re trying to bring it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.480" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">more into the ideas that we&#39;ve got on</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.650" style="s2">the channel and then into the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:18.350" style="s2">the wider online community and but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.650" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">not doing it alone we&#39;ve got an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.350" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">faculty who are gonna be helping us out</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:23.730" style="s2">with it as well and we wanted to play</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:25.260" style="s2">some clips from each of them to give it</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.730" end="00:03:26.970" style="s2">a bit more of a sense of what they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.260" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">delivering on the course so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.970" end="00:03:30.990" style="s2">start with someone a lot of people might</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">be familiar with daniel trachtenberg our</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.990" end="00:03:39.870" style="s2">earnestness and sincerity empowered by</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:43.530" style="s2">really deep courage and a deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.870" end="00:03:45.630" style="s2">epistemic humility is going to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.530" end="00:03:50.340" style="s2">someone misfit for every end group</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:53.910" style="s2">that people have to go through to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.720" end="00:03:56.670" style="s2">basically leave the forces that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.910" end="00:04:00.750" style="s2">irate arrayed in a war that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.670" end="00:04:02.700" style="s2">sides are wrong to hopefully have enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.750" end="00:04:05.310" style="s2">people who do that that start to find</p>

<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:35.570" style="s2">the next couple of days where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.500" end="00:04:37.490" style="s2">about and this is what is me talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.570" end="00:04:40.670" style="s2">about in the course is wisdom what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">wisdom and how do we embody it because</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.670" end="00:04:44.210" style="s2">it&#39;s much more than just a cognitive or</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:46.280" style="s2">an ideas based thing what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.210" end="00:04:48.020" style="s2">self-deception what are higher states of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.280" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">consciousness what is enlightenment what</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.020" end="00:04:52.730" style="s2">is wisdom what&#39;s our best cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:56.060" style="s2">scientific answer that and then can we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.730" end="00:04:58.310" style="s2">use that to create what I call psycho</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.060" end="00:05:01.570" style="s2">technologies and communities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.310" end="00:05:04.010" style="s2">ecologies of them that can give us back</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.570" end="00:05:06.770" style="s2">the cultivation of wisdom and self</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.010" end="00:05:10.420" style="s2">transcendence and also connect us up to</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.770" end="00:05:13.760" style="s2">a world of you that valorizes homes</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.420" end="00:05:15.830" style="s2">legitimates and make sense of that set</p>

<p begin="00:05:26.030" end="00:05:30.680" style="s2">aspect that&#39;s quite closely related to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.800" end="00:05:32.570" style="s2">it which is coherence and about how this</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.680" end="00:05:34.280" style="s2">process of being in and out of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.570" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">and the difference between coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.280" end="00:05:38.330" style="s2">difference is really essential for</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.840" end="00:05:40.790" style="s2">collective intelligence my experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.330" end="00:05:44.150" style="s2">create a lot of coherence and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.790" end="00:05:46.580" style="s2">heightened difference boom and then you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.150" end="00:05:48.290" style="s2">start to experience emergence and how to</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.580" end="00:05:49.820" style="s2">heighten difference is the skill set</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.290" end="00:05:51.410" style="s2">we&#39;re always trying to move everybody</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.820" end="00:05:54.230" style="s2">towards sameness and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.410" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">move everybody towards coherence but</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.230" end="00:05:59.000" style="s2">actually what we need to be doing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:06:01.400" style="s2">helping people calibrate and move</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.000" end="00:06:03.500" style="s2">together highly coherently and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.400" end="00:06:06.170" style="s2">really experience difference as it</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.500" end="00:06:09.230" style="s2">arises on an embodied level within the</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.170" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">interaction notice when it flips into</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.230" end="00:06:13.910" style="s2">threat and try to calibrate difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">and teach people how to be in difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.910" end="00:06:18.020" style="s2">because that&#39;s where emergence is more</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.850" style="s2">likely to to really make itself to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.020" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">really come forward as to this collision</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.850" end="00:06:25.340" style="s2">of difference that&#39;s what happens and we</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:26.780" style="s2">also have raffia Morgan who has been on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.340" end="00:06:27.860" style="s2">the channel a couple of times we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:06:35.030" end="00:06:41.270" style="s2">wisdom it has become kind of central to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.570" end="00:06:44.060" style="s2">the work that I do where I try and</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.270" end="00:06:47.210" style="s2">are people to get in touch with that</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.060" end="00:06:50.270" style="s2">inner longing or urge and let it guide</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.210" end="00:06:51.710" style="s2">them and I really trust this is like one</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.270" end="00:06:54.740" style="s2">of the most precious things we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.710" end="00:06:58.730" style="s2">inside that longing we&#39;ll take you where</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.740" end="00:07:03.020" style="s2">you need to go so if I&#39;m longing for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.730" end="00:07:04.880" style="s2">freedom which I am it doesn&#39;t take me</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.020" end="00:07:07.160" style="s2">necessarily to freedom it takes me in</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.880" end="00:07:09.740" style="s2">the direction of freedom but it takes me</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.160" end="00:07:11.930" style="s2">to those places inside of myself where</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.740" end="00:07:15.830" style="s2">I&#39;ve cut myself off from freedom where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.930" end="00:07:19.460" style="s2">put up a barrier so the longing is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.830" end="00:07:21.020" style="s2">it&#39;s very precise if you really feel it</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.460" end="00:07:22.640" style="s2">it takes you where you need to go where</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.020" end="00:07:25.130" style="s2">you need to go is where you shut down</p>
