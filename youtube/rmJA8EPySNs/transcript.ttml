<p begin="00:00:07.890" end="00:00:12.929" style="s2">swing at an area of America that needs</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.049" end="00:00:15.030" style="s2">really rapid reinvention fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.929" end="00:00:16.710" style="s2">reinvention we&#39;ve taken some big swings</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.030" end="00:00:19.440" style="s2">in the past weeks we&#39;ve looked at how to</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.710" end="00:00:22.050" style="s2">fundamentally reinvent regulation using</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.440" end="00:00:24.270" style="s2">more beefed up computer power how would</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.050" end="00:00:26.460" style="s2">we take on new notions of privacy why</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.270" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">would we reinvent patent law how would</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.460" end="00:00:30.330" style="s2">we read think essentially higher</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:32.219" style="s2">education these are big swings and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.330" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">they&#39;re very ambitious kind of goals but</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.219" end="00:00:36.600" style="s2">this may crashy taken out in the wrists</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:38.129" style="s2">really swinging for offenses on this one</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.600" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">we&#39;re really trying to think about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.129" end="00:00:42.749" style="s2">would we really reinvent governance</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">itself this is really just how we even</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.749" end="00:00:46.260" style="s2">govern ourselves in the 21st century and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:47.670" style="s2">how do we take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.260" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">technologies that are available now in</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.670" end="00:00:50.850" style="s2">the knowledge base we have now to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">things very differently than we we did</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.850" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">in the past and to do this when this</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">whole kind of thing started with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:58.769" style="s2">conversation when I met Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:00.510" style="s2">greenhalgh about a couple months ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.769" end="00:01:02.550" style="s2">who&#39;s going to be anchoring this</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.510" end="00:01:05.489" style="s2">conversation and leaving the roundtable</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.550" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">today and Jordan I met him at a at a at</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.489" end="00:01:10.680" style="s2">a conference around future governance</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.650" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">kind of lab essentially put on by one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.680" end="00:01:12.540" style="s2">the people who&#39;s gonna be in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:14.940" style="s2">roundtable here and we&#39;ll get to him in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.540" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">a minute and Jordan actually over the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.940" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">course of a lunch kind of put up out of</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.830" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">a thought experiment he said look at if</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">we were if you were back in 1775 there</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">was a lot of people saying hey we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:27.120" style="s2">like the politics we don&#39;t like our</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:28.800" style="s2">current government system let&#39;s reform</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.120" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">the current system and if we would have</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.800" end="00:01:32.550" style="s2">done that it would have been pleading</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:34.470" style="s2">for representation of the colonies in</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.550" end="00:01:36.060" style="s2">the British Parliament in London and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.470" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">that would have gotten if only so far</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.060" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">but there was an luckily enough people</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:41.160" style="s2">thinking let&#39;s really think clean slate</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:42.690" style="s2">blue sky let&#39;s think how could we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.160" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">this very different and of course coming</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.690" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">out of the revolution a dozen years</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:46.620" style="s2">later there was essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">Constitution convention had built the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.620" end="00:01:50.400" style="s2">kind of foundations of a way to govern</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:52.440" style="s2">ourselves essentially going forward well</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.400" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">if you look at it today there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.440" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">of a rough parallel to today where</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:02:00.030" style="s2">people are frustrated with our governing</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:01.380" style="s2">systems and our politics and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.030" end="00:02:03.480" style="s2">growing number of people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.380" end="00:02:05.400" style="s2">reform the current system and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.480" end="00:02:06.870" style="s2">tweak it change and I amend me make a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.400" end="00:02:08.159" style="s2">constitutional amendment or do things</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.870" end="00:02:09.719" style="s2">differently that could kind of change</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.159" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">the way we do things and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.719" end="00:02:13.379" style="s2">fantastic efforts doing that Lawrence</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">Lessig is doing a big one effect is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.379" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:18.379" style="s2">roundtable on July 11th aired for us as</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:20.640" style="s2">well but Jordan kind of poses sets the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.379" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">questions like what if we just started</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.640" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">to think more about how would we design</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.459" style="s2">governing governance systems just</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">knowing what we know now with our</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.459" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">technologies with our basic knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:32.730" style="s2">base is how we can organize things today</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:34.799" style="s2">how would you actually start from</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.730" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">scratch and really figure out a way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.799" end="00:02:39.090" style="s2">governance in the broadest sense which</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:41.220" style="s2">is collective problem soft how would we</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.090" end="00:02:42.629" style="s2">actually maximize the intelligence you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.220" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">could say and draw off of all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.629" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">capabilities or as much as we could of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">let&#39;s say the 300 million some 1 million</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">Americans if we think of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:53.130" style="s2">American context here and so it&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:55.019" style="s2">of interesting blue a clean slate fresh</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.130" end="00:02:56.819" style="s2">look that we&#39;re gonna do today and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.019" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">Jordans gonna lead us in that discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.819" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">but one of the great things about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">roundtable is that we&#39;re not just about</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:04.650" style="s2">Jordans ideas and in fact what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">beautiful about this is we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.650" end="00:03:08.099" style="s2">fantastic group of people come up from</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:10.200" style="s2">literally all over the world right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.099" end="00:03:11.819" style="s2">for this discussion that Jordan helped</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.200" end="00:03:14.819" style="s2">select them and have actually brought</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.819" end="00:03:16.260" style="s2">them into that the right kind of mix of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.819" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">folks for having this conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.260" end="00:03:19.079" style="s2">what we&#39;re gonna do now let&#39;s go around</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:20.370" style="s2">the roundtable just have people give a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.079" end="00:03:22.160" style="s2">little bit in action who they are and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.370" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">what they bring to the roundtable so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.160" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">let&#39;s say Jim do you want to say start</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:28.829" style="s2">off and tell us who we are wouldn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.310" style="s2">new initiative at the Institute called</p>

<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:42.750" style="s2">what you said Peter - to rethink the</p>

<p begin="00:04:42.750" end="00:04:46.560" style="s2">of governance as we&#39;ve known it and to</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.819" end="00:04:49.199" style="s2">give ourselves the license to think</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:51.449" style="s2">broadly about it so I&#39;m a political</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.199" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">futurist in that sense not who&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.449" end="00:04:56.430" style="s2">win the next election but how do we</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:04:58.889" style="s2">redesign our systems for the 21st</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.430" end="00:05:00.719" style="s2">century for the Anthropocene epoch when</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.889" end="00:05:01.259" style="s2">humans are the dominant force on the</p>

<p begin="00:05:01.259" end="00:05:07.319" style="s2">what kind of ideas values theories</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.889" end="00:05:10.349" style="s2">methods and tools can we implement and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.319" end="00:05:12.060" style="s2">and Marshall for that goal so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.349" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">goal of the lab and that&#39;s we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.060" end="00:05:15.389" style="s2">kicked off recently as you mentioned</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.770" end="00:08:35.529" style="s2">think we can learn a lot from there</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:37.719" style="s2">because they are emergent new practices</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.529" end="00:08:42.250" style="s2">and just to make a link with Tanya I</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.719" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">wrote an essay for a book called the</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.670" end="00:09:01.720" style="s2">Finland is really interesting as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.940" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">pioneer and in in these fields that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:05.769" style="s2">great to have you know great to have you</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.250" end="00:11:15.820" style="s2">some of the thoughts you can have it on</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">this subject okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.820" end="00:11:21.880" style="s2">so as an outline what I want to do is I</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:24.940" style="s2">want to start an initiative the set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.880" end="00:11:27.490" style="s2">axioms just instead of basic assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.940" end="00:11:29.710" style="s2">so that we can not have to spend too</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.490" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">much time trying to get our basic models</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.710" end="00:11:35.470" style="s2">of the space that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:37.330" style="s2">figured out and then after that talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.470" end="00:11:39.400" style="s2">about some boundary conditions of what</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.330" end="00:11:40.960" style="s2">any kind of a new model of Governments</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.400" end="00:11:42.130" style="s2">is going to have to deal with and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.960" end="00:11:44.740" style="s2">particular the boundary conditions that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.130" end="00:11:46.810" style="s2">are currently challenging to our current</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.740" end="00:11:49.750" style="s2">model of governance so these will be you</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.810" end="00:11:50.860" style="s2">may call additional conditions to what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.750" end="00:11:52.360" style="s2">you traditionally think of within the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.860" end="00:11:54.970" style="s2">notion of what governance has to deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.360" end="00:11:58.300" style="s2">with then do a quick walkthrough of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.970" end="00:11:59.860" style="s2">time on in a particular domain and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.300" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">find the concrete example of what that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.860" end="00:12:04.060" style="s2">my model might look like just that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.410" end="00:12:06.540" style="s2">got everything from the high levels of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.060" end="00:12:13.020" style="s2">abstraction down to at least a a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.540" end="00:12:13.020" style="s2">simulated concretions at some fine</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.050" end="00:12:21.400" style="s2">absolutely throw them in alright so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:25.470" style="s2">first major assumption is that the that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.400" end="00:12:28.690" style="s2">our current institutional toolkit is</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.470" end="00:12:30.640" style="s2">deeply broken and what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.690" end="00:12:32.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s the the mechanisms by which we</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.640" end="00:12:34.770" style="s2">satisfy four different governance</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.080" end="00:12:37.500" style="s2">functions it&#39;s the the mechanisms for</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.770" end="00:12:39.540" style="s2">diagnosing what our problems are</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.500" end="00:12:41.590" style="s2">deliberating on those problems and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.540" end="00:12:44.820" style="s2">designing solutions for those problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.590" end="00:12:46.660" style="s2">and implementing those solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.820" end="00:12:48.100" style="s2">regardless of what you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.660" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">scope of the challenges that we face I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.100" end="00:12:52.030" style="s2">think it&#39;s a good axiom to at least</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:12:54.850" style="s2">begin thinking about what if that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.030" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">particular system is so broken that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.850" end="00:12:58.500" style="s2">incremental modifications at the edges</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:00.460" style="s2">is not going to be adequate to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.500" end="00:13:01.030" style="s2">accelerating paces of the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.460" end="00:13:02.980" style="s2">we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.030" end="00:13:05.320" style="s2">so the first axiom is that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.980" end="00:13:07.710" style="s2">to have to contemplate a major break</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.320" end="00:13:09.550" style="s2">some sort of qualitative break that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.710" end="00:13:11.800" style="s2">might because they&#39;re very historical</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.550" end="00:13:14.900" style="s2">break depending on so the 1775 example</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.800" end="00:13:17.330" style="s2">is a good starting point</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.900" end="00:13:18.740" style="s2">okay now three more assumptions and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.330" end="00:13:21.410" style="s2">idea here is this this is a framework of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.740" end="00:13:22.910" style="s2">a diagnosis actually that when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.410" end="00:13:25.640" style="s2">engaging in some reasonably large</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.910" end="00:13:29.770" style="s2">transformation you almost never are</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.640" end="00:13:32.540" style="s2">going to be inventing your major tools</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.770" end="00:13:33.710" style="s2">all at once in point of fact what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.540" end="00:13:36.170" style="s2">actually doing is you&#39;re trying to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.710" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">suss out what kinds of key innovations</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:41.510" style="s2">have been going on and been lying at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:43.070" style="s2">edges and been made playing a larger and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.510" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">larger role in the the social</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.070" end="00:13:46.580" style="s2">infrastructure for possibly decades and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:49.220" style="s2">we don&#39;t want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.580" end="00:13:51.020" style="s2">diagnose those and then up regulate them</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.220" end="00:13:53.150" style="s2">and coalesce them into it the new</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.020" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">structure actually ends up becoming so</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.150" end="00:13:58.100" style="s2">within that framework the the three</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:13:59.510" style="s2">axiomatic would be that the new form of</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.100" end="00:14:02.390" style="s2">government&#39;s governance will be</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.510" end="00:14:04.100" style="s2">decentralized which stands as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.390" end="00:14:06.050" style="s2">significant breaking point from our</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.100" end="00:14:08.900" style="s2">current model and it will be</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.050" end="00:14:10.610" style="s2">decentralized enmeshed in information</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.900" end="00:14:12.260" style="s2">and specifically in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.610" end="00:14:14.870" style="s2">reputation architecture all right so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.260" end="00:14:17.210" style="s2">idea is to to try to break the the false</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.870" end="00:14:20.720" style="s2">double bond that exists in the twentieth</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.210" end="00:14:23.270" style="s2">century between products hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.720" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">systems and pure anarchy but rather to</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.270" end="00:14:27.050" style="s2">actually recognize the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:29.180" style="s2">you can generate effective structure in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.050" end="00:14:31.400" style="s2">a decentralized system by meshing it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.180" end="00:14:35.720" style="s2">an appropriately designed information</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.400" end="00:14:37.400" style="s2">environment the next is that this thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.720" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">whatever it is will be fluid in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.400" end="00:14:43.070" style="s2">polymorphic which is to say that it will</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:44.660" style="s2">be able to create ad hoc structures to</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.070" end="00:14:47.540" style="s2">deal with specific problems that require</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.660" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2">concentration but by virtue of tuning up</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.540" end="00:14:51.940" style="s2">what you might call viscosity rather</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:53.959" style="s2">than by attempting to instantiate</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.940" end="00:14:55.990" style="s2">concrete architectures that stand</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.959" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">outside the network itself and</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.990" end="00:15:00.110" style="s2">polymorphic meaning they will then be</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:01.820" style="s2">able to adapt itself with a high degree</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.110" end="00:15:02.300" style="s2">of fit to the problems that it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.820" end="00:15:06.290" style="s2">to solve</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.300" end="00:15:07.820" style="s2">I understand this is very abstract hope</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.290" end="00:15:09.850" style="s2">for the big homework more clear as we</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.820" end="00:15:12.380" style="s2">sort of walk down the co-creation path</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.850" end="00:15:13.760" style="s2">the next is that it will be Omni</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.380" end="00:15:16.190" style="s2">centered and increase on increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.760" end="00:15:17.420" style="s2">empowered individuals so in a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.190" end="00:15:19.880" style="s2">strong way we can actually think about</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.420" end="00:15:22.100" style="s2">this thing as being deeply about</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.880" end="00:15:24.110" style="s2">empowering individuals to play a strong</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.100" end="00:15:26.530" style="s2">role and actualize in themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.110" end="00:15:28.520" style="s2">that the governance structures are</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.530" end="00:15:30.230" style="s2">decentralized networks or</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.520" end="00:15:31.520" style="s2">around these individuals to resolve the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.230" end="00:15:34.100" style="s2">various problems that governance needs</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.520" end="00:15:37.490" style="s2">to resolve without inventing a super</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.100" end="00:15:40.760" style="s2">human or non-human entity or entities to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.490" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">be able to resolve those problems all</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.760" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">right so there&#39;s the axioms we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:45.770" style="s2">challenge some of them if we want to but</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:47.990" style="s2">we&#39;ll spend a lot of time doing that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.770" end="00:15:49.760" style="s2">we do now the next one the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.990" end="00:15:50.960" style="s2">conditions are much more food for</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.760" end="00:15:53.900" style="s2">thought these are the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.960" end="00:15:55.250" style="s2">believe are almost certainly things that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.900" end="00:15:58.370" style="s2">any new governance situation will have</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.250" end="00:16:00.350" style="s2">to deal with they may be these may be</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.370" end="00:16:02.120" style="s2">conditions that are in play right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.350" end="00:16:03.770" style="s2">there&#39;s may be conditions that will</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.120" end="00:16:05.060" style="s2">become more intense over the next 20 or</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.770" end="00:16:06.650" style="s2">30 years but certainly if we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.060" end="00:16:08.360" style="s2">be designing anything it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.650" end="00:16:10.190" style="s2">able to deal with the next call it 50</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.360" end="00:16:13.550" style="s2">years of problems that we expect to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.190" end="00:16:15.160" style="s2">happen so in no particular order the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.550" end="00:16:18.410" style="s2">transition from scarcity to abundance</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.160" end="00:16:20.090" style="s2">which has a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.410" end="00:16:22.070" style="s2">manifestations what that looks like but</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.090" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">the notion that we have at least the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.070" end="00:16:26.480" style="s2">potential to move from an environment</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.910" end="00:16:32.750" style="s2">to something which is a function of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.070" end="00:16:34.100" style="s2">way that we actually manage ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.750" end="00:16:35.420" style="s2">something that our new model of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.100" end="00:16:39.230" style="s2">governance needs to be able to handle at</p>

<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">work is that it needs to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:17:58.880" end="00:18:02.660" style="s2">so our new system has to have some</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.980" end="00:18:04.490" style="s2">mechanism by which existing elites who</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.660" end="00:18:07.700" style="s2">are in positions of authority in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.490" end="00:18:09.110" style="s2">current governance environment become</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.700" end="00:18:10.520" style="s2">aware of the fact that this is a better</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.110" end="00:18:13.010" style="s2">model for everyone including themselves</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.520" end="00:18:14.810" style="s2">and do not try to prevent it from</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.010" end="00:18:18.320" style="s2">happening in sort of a French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.810" end="00:18:20.030" style="s2">fashion and then the last is that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.320" end="00:18:21.260" style="s2">needs to be designed at least with some</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.030" end="00:18:23.300" style="s2">intent to construct something that is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.260" end="00:18:25.520" style="s2">highly resilient over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.300" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">resilient both to capture and to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.520" end="00:18:30.080" style="s2">internal corruption and this is a unique</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:32.170" style="s2">design problem actually because if we do</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.080" end="00:18:34.490" style="s2">design something effectively it will be</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.170" end="00:18:36.170" style="s2">for the first time in human history</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.490" end="00:18:37.550" style="s2">global and scale although not</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.550" end="00:18:41.270" style="s2">certainly not homogeneous and as a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.320" end="00:18:44.390" style="s2">consequence will lack a significant</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.270" end="00:18:46.160" style="s2">external competitor to force internal</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.390" end="00:18:47.960" style="s2">discipline and so designing something</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.160" end="00:18:49.460" style="s2">that is simultaneously capable of</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.960" end="00:18:51.710" style="s2">maintaining itself over the long term</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.460" end="00:18:53.900" style="s2">without falling into infighting or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.710" end="00:18:56.300" style="s2">without falling into significant capture</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.900" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">is another significant design problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.300" end="00:19:00.380" style="s2">that we make sure that we we capture I</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.400" end="00:19:02.090" style="s2">do not expect us by the way to invent</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.380" end="00:19:03.620" style="s2">that entirely today I just posed those</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.090" end="00:19:07.490" style="s2">as being a design requirements we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.620" end="00:19:08.510" style="s2">to keep in mind now to do a quick walk</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:09.770" style="s2">through the model women do is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.510" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">to focus on an area that is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.770" end="00:19:15.080" style="s2">frequently talked about and what a track</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:16.850" style="s2">called liquid jurisprudence that the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.080" end="00:19:18.830" style="s2">juridical function is a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.850" end="00:19:20.120" style="s2">function inside governance but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.830" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">one that is typically on the front</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.120" end="00:19:23.090" style="s2">burner so I thought it&#39;d be a good place</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:25.220" style="s2">for us to spend a little bit of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.090" end="00:19:27.440" style="s2">walking through a twin model and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.220" end="00:19:29.540" style="s2">notion here is to first imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.440" end="00:19:30.710" style="s2">network of people let&#39;s say for example</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.540" end="00:19:32.360" style="s2">a thousand people that you could scale</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.710" end="00:19:35.720" style="s2">it up to a billion people are down to a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.360" end="00:19:37.000" style="s2">hundred people if you&#39;d like and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.720" end="00:19:39.080" style="s2">think about what a reputation</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">architecture might be able to do to</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.080" end="00:19:44.690" style="s2">enable this network of individuals to be</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.480" end="00:19:51.080" style="s2">jurisprudence then we&#39;ll have to think</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.820" end="00:19:53.030" style="s2">about the notion of how the reputation</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.080" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">architecture is actually implemented and</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.030" end="00:19:55.879" style="s2">how it spreads across the social field</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:19:58.459" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.879" end="00:20:00.649" style="s2">finally how it&#39;s used so now to jump</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.459" end="00:20:02.209" style="s2">through the concretion will imagine our</p>

<p begin="00:21:05.959" end="00:21:10.039" style="s2">lived vital Authority in doing that sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.849" end="00:21:12.139" style="s2">of thing okay so that&#39;s the thought</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.039" end="00:21:13.969" style="s2">experiments you in a technical level you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.139" end="00:21:15.529" style="s2">simply imagine you&#39;ve got a variable</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.969" end="00:21:16.849" style="s2">called wisdom you&#39;ve got a network of</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.849" end="00:21:20.690" style="s2">that variable calls wisdom flows from</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.349" end="00:21:23.539" style="s2">each node to every other node creating a</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.690" end="00:21:25.669" style="s2">differential and point of view field of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.539" end="00:21:28.999" style="s2">wisdom so for example John Rob might</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.669" end="00:21:32.629" style="s2">esteem Michelle but Michelle might</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.999" end="00:21:34.190" style="s2">esteem Tania and so that&#39;s a the point</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.629" end="00:21:35.539" style="s2">of view from John we have Tanya is lower</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.190" end="00:21:37.099" style="s2">than Michelle the point from Michelle</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.539" end="00:21:39.139" style="s2">would have time is higher than himself</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.099" end="00:21:41.269" style="s2">perhaps and the idea is that this gives</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.139" end="00:21:44.899" style="s2">us a really flexible and rich</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.269" end="00:21:47.929" style="s2">multi-dimensional fabric to work with so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.899" end="00:21:49.339" style="s2">how&#39;s it work implementing it can either</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.929" end="00:21:50.179" style="s2">be done passively or actively I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.339" end="00:21:51.379" style="s2">want to get too deep into the</p>

<p begin="00:21:51.379" end="00:21:54.499" style="s2">can take us down to the weeds pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.999" end="00:21:55.759" style="s2">quickly but you can imagine either being</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.499" end="00:21:57.499" style="s2">simply formal that everybody goes</p>

<p begin="00:22:04.399" end="00:22:08.449" style="s2">capable at this sort of thing or you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.279" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">simply have it happen actively by</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.650" style="s2">resolving conflict we can imagine say</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.150" end="00:23:53.090" style="s2">for example three individuals one of</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.070" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">these more distance who then are</p>

<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:05.000" style="s2">on and of course the more the social</p>

<p begin="00:24:13.370" end="00:24:16.190" style="s2">towards it and the more significant</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.809" end="00:24:18.470" style="s2">individuals might be actually flagged</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.190" end="00:24:21.050" style="s2">and rather to deal with it and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.470" end="00:24:22.220" style="s2">resolution happens in real time as</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.870" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">happened with the effort to make that</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.910" end="00:24:44.300" style="s2">part of our collective intelligence or</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">that our collective wisdom an</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.300" end="00:24:47.330" style="s2">understanding of what this company was</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:48.530" style="s2">about how it emerged how we dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.330" end="00:24:50.600" style="s2">it and the degree to which we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.530" end="00:24:52.190" style="s2">it was actually resolved and then a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.600" end="00:24:55.670" style="s2">continuing adjustment in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.190" end="00:24:57.590" style="s2">wisdom field so that it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.670" end="00:25:03.140" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re describing a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.590" end="00:25:04.429" style="s2">specific design for governance right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.140" end="00:25:06.770" style="s2">trying to get on trying to put together</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.429" end="00:25:10.370" style="s2">a toy model of a specific instantiation</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.770" end="00:25:11.809" style="s2">of a generalized concept yeah I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.370" end="00:25:14.510" style="s2">worried that most of the people watching</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.809" end="00:25:19.490" style="s2">the search just at the beginner stage or</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.510" end="00:25:21.980" style="s2">maybe even on the training wheels I very</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.490" end="00:25:24.170" style="s2">well may be true and maybe we actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.980" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">well actually you know yeah I would not</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.170" end="00:25:27.740" style="s2">worry too much about you know I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:29.540" style="s2">would keep it at a very high level so I</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.740" end="00:25:35.059" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t worry too much about that but</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.540" end="00:25:37.330" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a good point John but I</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.059" end="00:25:39.620" style="s2">think I would just carry on for now and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.330" end="00:25:42.500" style="s2">Jordan and just just keep laying out the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.620" end="00:25:44.600" style="s2">pieces there and then we roll into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.500" end="00:25:45.890" style="s2">conversation but that this stage is just</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:48.050" style="s2">like let&#39;s let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.890" end="00:25:51.230" style="s2">that you want to basically play out here</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.050" end="00:25:53.720" style="s2">Jordan yeah I said the way to go yeah my</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.230" end="00:25:55.700" style="s2">hope John is that by virtue of if the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.720" end="00:25:56.810" style="s2">people on this call can get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:25:57.380" style="s2">where we actually are making any sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.810" end="00:25:59.930" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.380" end="00:26:04.400" style="s2">that that creative process will help</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.930" end="00:26:09.020" style="s2">everybody else as well okay if not then</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.400" end="00:26:10.820" style="s2">it fail no yeah I think I think your</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.020" end="00:26:14.360" style="s2">discussion of the assumptions is going</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.820" end="00:26:15.560" style="s2">to be very productive absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.360" end="00:26:18.230" style="s2">then it&#39;s a last component for those</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.560" end="00:26:20.300" style="s2">people who consider the allocation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.230" end="00:26:22.100" style="s2">social resources to be important another</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.300" end="00:26:24.110" style="s2">piece of a potential design model might</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.100" end="00:26:26.210" style="s2">be something that we or at least I call</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.110" end="00:26:27.830" style="s2">Commons currency and the notion here is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.210" end="00:26:30.560" style="s2">we can actually determine to allocate</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.830" end="00:26:32.690" style="s2">resources in a pool let&#39;s say for</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.560" end="00:26:35.690" style="s2">example we allocate over a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.690" end="00:26:37.790" style="s2">people a million dollars a year so a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.690" end="00:26:39.260" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars a month that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.790" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">actually allocated according to your</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.260" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">wisdom gradient so this is solves the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:45.860" style="s2">mechanism have we actually go about</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:49.070" style="s2">financing ad hoc institutions that if</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.860" end="00:26:51.320" style="s2">individuals find themselves called upon</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.070" end="00:26:52.910" style="s2">to resolve conflicts and find themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.320" end="00:26:54.800" style="s2">esteemed within their local network as</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.910" end="00:26:56.330" style="s2">being good at this sort of thing then</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.800" end="00:26:57.590" style="s2">there are social resources allocated to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.330" end="00:26:59.390" style="s2">that particular sort of thing and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.590" end="00:27:00.920" style="s2">can find themselves resourced as</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.390" end="00:27:03.080" style="s2">necessary to do we which is either</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.920" end="00:27:04.580" style="s2">motivational or enabling them to engage</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.080" end="00:27:06.200" style="s2">in activities need to engage in for</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.580" end="00:27:09.650" style="s2">example flying to Athens to meet people</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.200" end="00:27:11.330" style="s2">need to fly and meet in Athens so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.650" end="00:27:12.830" style="s2">comma Commons currency concept is</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.330" end="00:27:15.020" style="s2">another piece that might be applied as</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.830" end="00:27:16.370" style="s2">part of the toy model to create a</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.020" end="00:27:18.290" style="s2">scalable system that is fluid in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.370" end="00:27:19.580" style="s2">polymorphic and yet is able to adapt to</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.290" end="00:27:22.400" style="s2">the specific set of problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.580" end="00:27:24.800" style="s2">deal with we can run that one very far</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.400" end="00:27:26.120" style="s2">if we&#39;d like to so that&#39;s it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.800" end="00:27:28.670" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the setting of the stage</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.120" end="00:27:31.040" style="s2">so walking down from a series of axioms</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.670" end="00:27:32.450" style="s2">a series of boundary conditions a basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.040" end="00:27:34.010" style="s2">concept of what these sorts of models</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.450" end="00:27:37.400" style="s2">would look like in any given domain and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.010" end="00:27:38.990" style="s2">then a sort of a very concrete toy model</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.400" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">of what it might look like in the domain</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.990" end="00:27:42.740" style="s2">of jurisprudence which hopefully creates</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.360" end="00:27:45.200" style="s2">some bias against what our current</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.740" end="00:27:48.170" style="s2">current set of institutions look like</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.200" end="00:27:49.340" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously very far distant from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.170" end="00:27:51.790" style="s2">set of institutions that are invented</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:54.350" style="s2">back in Hammurabi&#39;s time of creating a a</p>

<p begin="00:28:23.059" end="00:28:27.109" style="s2">the point that I want to drive home is</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.469" end="00:28:31.210" style="s2">how far can we run with a new model that</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.109" end="00:28:33.349" style="s2">has this more fluid structure okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.210" end="00:28:36.379" style="s2">okay great so that&#39;s a good kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.349" end="00:28:38.419" style="s2">setting up of the table here in I just</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.379" end="00:28:40.429" style="s2">don&#39;t open it to the table just go</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.419" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">around a little bit I just build on what</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.429" end="00:28:46.249" style="s2">he said I mean John you mentioned for</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:47.419" style="s2">example the assumptions do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.249" end="00:28:49.369" style="s2">jump in and just kind of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.419" end="00:28:50.869" style="s2">others you know feel free to actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.369" end="00:28:53.119" style="s2">let&#39;s just kind of build off of what he</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.869" end="00:28:54.710" style="s2">said there and push it and proud it and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.119" end="00:28:59.059" style="s2">think about a little bit in and see</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.710" end="00:29:01.190" style="s2">where it goes from there yeah um you</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.059" end="00:29:02.779" style="s2">know Jordans description of a specific</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.190" end="00:29:04.820" style="s2">design in you know for governance</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.779" end="00:29:06.769" style="s2">structures is amazing and we&#39;ve had you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.820" end="00:29:10.460" style="s2">know a lot of discussions on this in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.769" end="00:29:12.139" style="s2">past what I&#39;ve done recently is started</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.460" end="00:29:15.799" style="s2">to think about more you know basic</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.139" end="00:29:17.899" style="s2">assumptions and basic models I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.799" end="00:29:20.109" style="s2">was clear to me that it national</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.899" end="00:29:22.129" style="s2">governance global governance is failing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.109" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">primarily because the political process</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.669" end="00:29:31.549" style="s2">communications have gone global and</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.080" end="00:29:40.299" style="s2">political structure the basic</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.320" end="00:29:44.570" style="s2">organizational principles that we use</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.299" end="00:29:46.489" style="s2">for the economy and for poly politics a</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.570" end="00:29:48.200" style="s2">you know combination of bureaucracy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.489" end="00:29:52.339" style="s2">markets doesn&#39;t seem to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.200" end="00:29:54.019" style="s2">handle their current technology so it</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.339" end="00:29:57.739" style="s2">was built for an industrial model and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.019" end="00:29:59.779" style="s2">now it&#39;s a globally networked model and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.739" end="00:30:02.149" style="s2">so that&#39;s failing what appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.779" end="00:30:04.580" style="s2">replacements for that would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.149" end="00:30:06.830" style="s2">given that technology tends to dictate</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.580" end="00:30:11.119" style="s2">you know how we&#39;re going to evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.830" end="00:30:13.020" style="s2">terms of governance is a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.119" end="00:30:15.690" style="s2">like a peer-to-peer and hot</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.020" end="00:30:18.419" style="s2">kind of work that Michelle does and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.690" end="00:30:20.820" style="s2">the few too many systems like you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.419" end="00:30:23.549" style="s2">with Google we&#39;re a couple hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.820" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">people can deliver a system that handles</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.549" end="00:30:29.490" style="s2">you know the needs of billions and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:33.000" style="s2">kind of those organizational models will</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.490" end="00:30:34.529" style="s2">deliver the services in terms of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.000" end="00:30:37.649" style="s2">I&#39;m doing right now I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.529" end="00:30:40.610" style="s2">combination of these online models you</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.649" end="00:30:43.500" style="s2">know peer-to-peer and few too many</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.610" end="00:30:47.820" style="s2">operating an online realm delivering</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.500" end="00:30:49.409" style="s2">information and connecting us will have</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.820" end="00:30:51.450" style="s2">resilient communities the communities</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.409" end="00:30:53.940" style="s2">that do most of the production clearly</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.450" end="00:30:55.890" style="s2">most of the technologies now at least in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.940" end="00:30:59.179" style="s2">manufacturing production are moving</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.890" end="00:31:02.250" style="s2">towards doing things at the local we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.179" end="00:31:03.750" style="s2">doing almost everything we will be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.250" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">to do a produce almost everything we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.750" end="00:31:11.909" style="s2">need at the local level which tends to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:14.070" style="s2">point towards a you know social</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.909" end="00:31:16.110" style="s2">governance occurring more at a community</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.070" end="00:31:17.490" style="s2">level maybe at a city state level and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.110" end="00:31:19.289" style="s2">then interconnecting at a global level</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.490" end="00:31:22.770" style="s2">using peer-to-peer and few too many</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.289" end="00:31:25.380" style="s2">networks so that you know those core</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.770" end="00:31:27.330" style="s2">assumptions for me you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.380" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">drive the situation and specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.330" end="00:31:32.490" style="s2">instantiations of governance models like</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:34.470" style="s2">you know we were talking about in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.490" end="00:31:37.649" style="s2">of this design would be designed by</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.470" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">people and then spread virally now like</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.649" end="00:31:41.159" style="s2">for instance say Singapore adopted many</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:43.049" style="s2">of those items and said okay we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.159" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">to attach a passport to it and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.049" end="00:31:46.890" style="s2">going to expand our city state to 200</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">million of the best people in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.890" end="00:31:50.789" style="s2">country or the world and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:52.799" style="s2">adopt them as citizens and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.789" end="00:31:56.070" style="s2">to stitch them together in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.799" end="00:31:58.529" style="s2">unique in interesting ways well in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.070" end="00:32:00.870" style="s2">instance that you have a city state the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.529" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">virtual city state that could be</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.870" end="00:32:05.669" style="s2">extremely powerful and you know do much</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:09.270" style="s2">much more than what we see with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.669" end="00:32:12.679" style="s2">current of physical government</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.270" end="00:32:16.200" style="s2">structures so just tossing that out man</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.679" end="00:32:18.870" style="s2">people you know feel free to disagree</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.200" end="00:32:22.529" style="s2">with me or correct me or give me</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.870" end="00:32:23.880" style="s2">feedback on that and Jordan if you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.529" end="00:32:25.260" style="s2">to stitch it into your structure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.880" end="00:32:27.330" style="s2">fine too</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.260" end="00:32:30.360" style="s2">I&#39;m out I&#39;ll steal all of your ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.330" end="00:32:32.310" style="s2">Jenna no question about that make sure</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.360" end="00:32:36.330" style="s2">it sounds like we show and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.310" end="00:32:40.380" style="s2">and then and then Jim will go to use yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.330" end="00:32:44.160" style="s2">sir I you know I have some issues also</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.380" end="00:32:47.460" style="s2">with the assumptions actually and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.160" end="00:32:49.650" style="s2">know this I can find myself in New York</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.460" end="00:32:51.390" style="s2">I DS of Jordan but of course the key</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.650" end="00:32:55.970" style="s2">issue is how do we get from here to</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.390" end="00:33:00.150" style="s2">there and you know my sense is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.970" end="00:33:02.850" style="s2">governance and democracy are very much</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.150" end="00:33:07.350" style="s2">linked to issues of power I was reading</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.850" end="00:33:09.390" style="s2">yesterday that 8,000 occupy activists</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.350" end="00:33:11.970" style="s2">have been arrested and 0 bankers so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.390" end="00:33:14.160" style="s2">is you know kind of a if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.970" end="00:33:17.160" style="s2">harm but potential harm has been done to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.160" end="00:33:18.390" style="s2">society between occupying the bankers I</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.160" end="00:33:21.030" style="s2">don&#39;t think there is a match and yet</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.390" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">there&#39;s no bankers in jail but 8,000</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.030" end="00:33:28.020" style="s2">activists so how do you how do we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:29.550" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s not it so it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.020" end="00:33:31.770" style="s2">technical fix democracy is not a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.550" end="00:33:36.450" style="s2">technical fix if you look at American</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.770" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">democracy and European democracy they</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.450" end="00:33:41.190" style="s2">were originally proprietary democracies</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">right there were only people who had</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.190" end="00:33:46.590" style="s2">property had a right to vote and at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">same time the workers didn&#39;t have a vote</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.590" end="00:33:53.880" style="s2">the women didn&#39;t have a vote the slaves</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:57.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a vote so all these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.880" end="00:33:59.790" style="s2">came through pretty much intense social</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.780" end="00:34:02.790" style="s2">struggles so I&#39;m just kind of wondering</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.790" end="00:34:05.970" style="s2">you know who is going to do that change</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.790" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">you know what&#39;s the agent that is going</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.970" end="00:34:11.129" style="s2">to put into place this this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:12.720" style="s2">system that we have in mind so this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.129" end="00:34:16.139" style="s2">just a kind of open question I would</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.720" end="00:34:17.639" style="s2">like to put out there I mean I mean one</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.139" end="00:34:19.590" style="s2">thing I would just say about that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.639" end="00:34:20.820" style="s2">maybe we could hold that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.590" end="00:34:22.080" style="s2">dimension towards the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.820" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">conversation here but one of things we</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.080" end="00:34:27.360" style="s2">try to avoid a little bit in these</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:29.010" style="s2">reinvention roundtables is we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.360" end="00:34:30.629" style="s2">thinking about let&#39;s first think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.010" end="00:34:33.600" style="s2">what&#39;s possible what&#39;s what other</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.629" end="00:34:35.220" style="s2">knowing that the technology is knowing</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.600" end="00:34:36.510" style="s2">the kind of capabilities we have now as</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.220" end="00:34:38.950" style="s2">opposed to hundred twenty-five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.510" end="00:34:41.230" style="s2">or remember this last systems were built</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.950" end="00:34:42.970" style="s2">um you know what&#39;s possible because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.230" end="00:34:44.710" style="s2">think too often we get too constrained</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.970" end="00:34:46.659" style="s2">by what&#39;s the politics that&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.710" end="00:34:47.770" style="s2">it to go or what will take it and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.659" end="00:34:49.149" style="s2">agree that what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.770" end="00:34:50.950" style="s2">fundamentally is are also a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.149" end="00:34:52.599" style="s2">critical issue and at some point we</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.950" end="00:34:54.159" style="s2">would have to make that transition but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.599" end="00:34:55.570" style="s2">feel like at this stage we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.159" end="00:34:57.220" style="s2">trying to open up the space a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.570" end="00:34:59.410" style="s2">so maybe we could just think of like you</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.220" end="00:35:01.060" style="s2">know what could we pull off setting</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.410" end="00:35:03.339" style="s2">aside the difficulty of the politics to</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.060" end="00:35:05.560" style="s2">make it happen but but or maybe we could</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.339" end="00:35:08.050" style="s2">get that question a bit later Jim you</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.560" end="00:35:10.210" style="s2">want to jump in Jim and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.050" end="00:35:13.050" style="s2">Brett you and then the content on you go</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.210" end="00:35:13.050" style="s2">ahead Jim</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.230" end="00:35:22.359" style="s2">you&#39;re really Jim yeah Jim you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.500" end="00:35:24.900" style="s2">muted you got to go off the mute off on</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.359" end="00:35:24.900" style="s2">the upper right hand</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.950" end="00:35:31.790" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:35.060" style="s2">here we go all right can you hear me now</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.790" end="00:35:36.920" style="s2">yeah all right I think I will we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.060" end="00:35:42.050" style="s2">gonna take a brief swing at McHale&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.920" end="00:35:46.390" style="s2">question actually when I think of a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.050" end="00:35:49.190" style="s2">large-scale state transitions in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.390" end="00:35:52.090" style="s2">complex network of networks operating at</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.190" end="00:35:54.619" style="s2">lots of levels seems to me the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.090" end="00:35:57.710" style="s2">transition strategy has to be a fractal</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.619" end="00:35:59.780" style="s2">one where things are created at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.710" end="00:36:02.750" style="s2">local level which are self-consistent at</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.780" end="00:36:05.359" style="s2">an intermediate level call it the region</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.750" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">or the state in u.s. parlance the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.359" end="00:36:10.250" style="s2">province and France etc and then at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:12.980" style="s2">national and the global and if a system</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.250" end="00:36:14.420" style="s2">is well designed the same principles</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.980" end="00:36:18.170" style="s2">ought to be applicable at all those</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.420" end="00:36:20.570" style="s2">levels simultaneously and hence efforts</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.170" end="00:36:22.880" style="s2">should be operating in parallel at all</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.570" end="00:36:25.700" style="s2">effort at all levels and some levels</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.880" end="00:36:27.680" style="s2">will operate change will happen more</p>

<p begin="00:36:56.570" end="00:37:03.290" style="s2">might quibble a little bit with the road</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.230" end="00:37:05.839" style="s2">from scarcity to abundance and might</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.290" end="00:37:10.040" style="s2">describe that as a transition into a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.839" end="00:37:15.140" style="s2">hybrid world where there&#39;s both scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.040" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">and abundance where there&#39;s you know may</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.140" end="00:37:20.510" style="s2">well be scarcity of certain material</p>

<p begin="00:37:32.480" end="00:37:38.810" style="s2">little twiddle there with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.300" end="00:37:43.460" style="s2">living in the environment and probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.810" end="00:37:46.730" style="s2">resilience I&#39;d highlight a classic</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.460" end="00:37:49.310" style="s2">with primates including primates with</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.730" end="00:37:55.430" style="s2">clothes and that is the hyperbolic</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.310" end="00:37:58.130" style="s2">discount rate so far humans and other</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.430" end="00:38:00.080" style="s2">primates seem to absolutely discount the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.130" end="00:38:02.810" style="s2">future at very high rates even higher</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.080" end="00:38:06.020" style="s2">rates emotionally than financial markets</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.810" end="00:38:08.750" style="s2">do we all know that a 3% economic</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.020" end="00:38:11.020" style="s2">discount rate basically says 5 500 years</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.750" end="00:38:13.250" style="s2">now is worth nothing but a human</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.020" end="00:38:15.920" style="s2">emotional hyperbolic discount rate</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.250" end="00:38:20.510" style="s2">produces even lower values even earlier</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.920" end="00:38:22.970" style="s2">so I would say that&#39;s a sort of a deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.510" end="00:38:25.880" style="s2">issue that any system like this has to</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.970" end="00:38:29.660" style="s2">figure out how to finesse and then the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.880" end="00:38:33.620" style="s2">third is your concept of the elites</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.660" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">going gently into the night may not be</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.620" end="00:38:42.700" style="s2">the way it actually plays out is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:46.070" style="s2">actually necessary just a just a quick</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.700" end="00:38:48.830" style="s2">response so I accept the probably the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.070" end="00:38:50.600" style="s2">twiddle on abundance of scarcity I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.830" end="00:38:52.310" style="s2">think I tried to premise it by saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:54.170" style="s2">that it does assume you switched from</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.310" end="00:38:55.490" style="s2">them but scarcity to abundance but</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.170" end="00:38:56.870" style="s2">rather this system has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.490" end="00:38:58.670" style="s2">fact that for the first time abundance</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.870" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">is a variable we have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.670" end="00:39:03.890" style="s2">process the current system is very bad</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:05.090" style="s2">at that on elites the specific boundary</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.890" end="00:39:06.560" style="s2">condition is that we have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.090" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">fact that existing elites might not</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.560" end="00:39:10.970" style="s2">understand their self-interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:12.470" style="s2">transition which may play out in a wide</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.970" end="00:39:13.970" style="s2">variety of different ways but it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.470" end="00:39:15.650" style="s2">to be played out and that I think is the</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.970" end="00:39:17.840" style="s2">specific thing we have to be thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.650" end="00:39:18.950" style="s2">about what are the variable scenarios on</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.840" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">how that might be played out and how</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.950" end="00:39:26.210" style="s2">would those specifically be dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:29.090" style="s2">what about discount rates how do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.210" end="00:39:31.730" style="s2">finesse the fact that primates were</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.090" end="00:39:33.500" style="s2">evolved to eat all the fruit they found</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.730" end="00:39:35.840" style="s2">because they might not find anymore for</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.500" end="00:39:37.670" style="s2">quite a while I think that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.840" end="00:39:38.600" style="s2">astute point attaches very well to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.670" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">notion that we have to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.600" end="00:39:42.140" style="s2">deal with our our governance system has</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:46.310" style="s2">to be able to contemplate intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.140" end="00:39:47.390" style="s2">how we he&#39;ll deal effectively with their</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.780" end="00:39:57.260" style="s2">were up and then in Tanja after that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.400" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">just in and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.260" end="00:40:03.550" style="s2">Jake looks like oh they yeah a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:06.110" style="s2">things first I wanted to take a crack at</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.550" end="00:40:07.940" style="s2">maybe slightly recasting what I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.110" end="00:40:12.380" style="s2">Jordan is said to see if I understand it</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.940" end="00:40:14.090" style="s2">correctly I think Jordan what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.380" end="00:40:17.120" style="s2">getting at is that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.090" end="00:40:19.550" style="s2">features of a functional society that</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.120" end="00:40:22.700" style="s2">work very well at small scales and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.550" end="00:40:25.310" style="s2">without hierarchy and this is well known</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.700" end="00:40:27.710" style="s2">in entropy illogical circles and that</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.310" end="00:40:29.740" style="s2">those things come apart as you scale up</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.710" end="00:40:33.290" style="s2">above a certain size and what you need</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.740" end="00:40:34.790" style="s2">initially to solve the problems of you</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.290" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">know for example tragedies of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.790" end="00:40:43.090" style="s2">Commons above a certain scale is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:46.010" style="s2">hierarchy that is capable of delivering</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.090" end="00:40:48.050" style="s2">costs to individuals who violate the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.010" end="00:40:49.820" style="s2">collective interest but then that</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.050" end="00:40:51.560" style="s2">creates a secondary problem we are now</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.820" end="00:40:55.070" style="s2">living the consequences of it which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.560" end="00:40:57.350" style="s2">that those hierarchies are corruptible</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.070" end="00:41:00.440" style="s2">and capturable and that when they become</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.350" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">captured by forces which I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.440" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">are evolved responses to an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:11.080" style="s2">they become predatory and so in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:13.850" style="s2">what you&#39;re outlining is a mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.080" end="00:41:16.190" style="s2">getting the necessary benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.850" end="00:41:19.160" style="s2">hierarchy that allow you to scale beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.190" end="00:41:22.040" style="s2">those points while circumventing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.160" end="00:41:24.020" style="s2">problem of capture the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.040" end="00:41:26.000" style="s2">hierarchy itself becomes an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.020" end="00:41:29.090" style="s2">for those who would figure out how to</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.090" end="00:41:34.420" style="s2">jurisprudence example seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">able to deliver the benefits of</p>

<p begin="00:41:55.970" end="00:41:58.850" style="s2">look at just the history of</p>

<p begin="00:43:31.130" end="00:43:35.840" style="s2">imminent set of dynamics as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.590" end="00:43:37.790" style="s2">actual structure and lacks entirely the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.840" end="00:43:40.430" style="s2">notion of an evident of a position that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.790" end="00:43:43.130" style="s2">lives above the horizontal field but is</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.430" end="00:43:44.960" style="s2">able to emerge a sort of a virtual set</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.130" end="00:43:47.060" style="s2">of hierarchies through viscosity as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.960" end="00:43:50.230" style="s2">mentioned earlier to play those roles as</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.060" end="00:43:55.250" style="s2">necessary on an ad hoc and fluid basis</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.230" end="00:43:56.750" style="s2">great well then I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.250" end="00:43:59.600" style="s2">interesting because it actually points</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.750" end="00:44:02.060" style="s2">to the answer to Jim&#39;s question about</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.600" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">the hyperbolic discount rate that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.060" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">know in fact you&#39;ve provided a toy model</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:08.360" style="s2">for solving problems and that that model</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:10.810" style="s2">actually can be applied to lots of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.360" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">things you know the reason that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.810" end="00:44:15.650" style="s2">primates evolved to have that discount</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:19.400" style="s2">rate is actually quite parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.650" end="00:44:21.830" style="s2">reason that animals evolved to senescent</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.400" end="00:44:24.230" style="s2">to to grow fragile in age which is not</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.830" end="00:44:24.620" style="s2">the senescence isn&#39;t negative from the</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.230" end="00:44:26.600" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.620" end="00:44:28.220" style="s2">you have selection but that many</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.600" end="00:44:30.020" style="s2">creatures don&#39;t live to suffer the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.220" end="00:44:32.210" style="s2">effects of it and so from selections</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.020" end="00:44:34.940" style="s2">point of view the future though it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.210" end="00:44:37.250" style="s2">all-important is less visible to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.940" end="00:44:39.550" style="s2">selection it is subordinate to what</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.250" end="00:44:42.740" style="s2">happens in the present so what we find</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.550" end="00:44:44.570" style="s2">humans doing is prioritizing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.740" end="00:44:47.330" style="s2">immediate because they have vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.570" end="00:44:49.550" style="s2">control over the immediate even though</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.330" end="00:44:51.500" style="s2">in the end if if you build a system that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.550" end="00:44:53.180" style="s2">functions in the short-term at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.500" end="00:44:55.640" style="s2">expense of its ability to persist in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.180" end="00:44:59.090" style="s2">long-term obviously the whole project is</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.640" end="00:45:02.920" style="s2">a failure so your your solution about</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.090" end="00:45:06.380" style="s2">taking essentially modern tools and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.920" end="00:45:09.500" style="s2">using them to correct the defects in the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.380" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">system allows us to deliver the costs</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.500" end="00:45:13.730" style="s2">that will be realized in the future for</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:15.770" style="s2">certain behaviors and to deliver them in</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.730" end="00:45:20.450" style="s2">the present in the way that allows</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.770" end="00:45:22.460" style="s2">people to well initially suffer the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.450" end="00:45:24.950" style="s2">costs of the harm that they do to their</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.460" end="00:45:26.510" style="s2">own system and ultimately to intuit</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.950" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">the harm that they will do to their own</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.510" end="00:45:34.010" style="s2">system and to regard it as negative okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:35.120" style="s2">good yeah you know one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.010" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">implicit in all this which is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.120" end="00:45:38.390" style="s2">interesting is you know we have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:40.550" style="s2">technologies which you didn&#39;t really lay</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.390" end="00:45:41.810" style="s2">out exactly Jordan but it&#39;s implicit in</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.550" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">all this is that we finally have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.810" end="00:45:44.570" style="s2">technologies to do this in a way that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:47.840" style="s2">could not have designed these systems</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.570" end="00:45:48.980" style="s2">even twenty five fifty years ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.840" end="00:45:50.630" style="s2">think that&#39;s something we could get to a</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.980" end="00:45:51.830" style="s2">little bit in the conversation but Tania</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.630" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">you you&#39;ve been wanting to say something</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.830" end="00:45:56.600" style="s2">why don&#39;t we go to you and get your</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:45:58.580" style="s2">reactions from what you got sure yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.600" end="00:46:00.230" style="s2">thanks first of all thanks John and for</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.580" end="00:46:02.300" style="s2">laying out this fascinating model I</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.230" end="00:46:04.760" style="s2">really like it and it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.300" end="00:46:06.680" style="s2">thought-provoking but I really like</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.760" end="00:46:10.670" style="s2">about it one thing that I like about it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.680" end="00:46:12.800" style="s2">is that framing democracy and police and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.670" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">making a straw men solving rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.800" end="00:46:18.250" style="s2">struggle like a power struggle or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:20.750" style="s2">struggle of values because if we frame</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.250" end="00:46:22.820" style="s2">democracy as problem-solving it helps us</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.750" end="00:46:26.030" style="s2">actually to find solutions and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.820" end="00:46:28.370" style="s2">tackle problems as we tackle problems as</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.030" end="00:46:31.070" style="s2">engineers and computer scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.370" end="00:46:33.220" style="s2">looking for the best solutions but yet</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.070" end="00:46:35.330" style="s2">for instance in the case of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.220" end="00:46:38.150" style="s2">crowd-sourced of road traffic law in</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.330" end="00:46:39.980" style="s2">Finland just like Peter said</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.150" end="00:46:42.109" style="s2">we have this technology which is very</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.980" end="00:46:43.970" style="s2">easy to use to actually find a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.109" end="00:46:46.359" style="s2">like hundreds of solutions for problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.970" end="00:46:49.670" style="s2">that we have when we try to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.359" end="00:46:51.470" style="s2">off-road traffic for instance how - one</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.670" end="00:46:53.539" style="s2">question that we have is how to monitor</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.470" end="00:46:56.599" style="s2">off-road traffic in an cost-efficient</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.539" end="00:46:58.789" style="s2">and in a transparent and good way and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.599" end="00:47:01.309" style="s2">now we have several different solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.789" end="00:47:04.609" style="s2">for that which is great but yet then we</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.309" end="00:47:07.609" style="s2">easily return back to the Crescent of</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.609" end="00:47:09.500" style="s2">values and power like who how can we</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.609" end="00:47:11.450" style="s2">actually make a decision what is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.500" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">best solution and what is the solution</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.450" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">that will be implemented and that those</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:18.020" style="s2">criteria are typically based on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">existing values and the existing power</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.020" end="00:47:22.819" style="s2">structures in the established democracy</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:24.349" style="s2">in this case there in Finland they</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.819" end="00:47:28.579" style="s2">established society that we have there</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.349" end="00:47:31.670" style="s2">but now now if we take children&#39;s model</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.579" end="00:47:37.000" style="s2">and think about the transparency the and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.670" end="00:47:39.650" style="s2">the aspects of a fluid like like trans</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.000" end="00:47:42.520" style="s2">transformation and movement of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.650" end="00:47:45.410" style="s2">information between and across</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.520" end="00:47:47.299" style="s2">nation-states that can help us solving</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.410" end="00:47:49.220" style="s2">that problem because then we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.299" end="00:47:51.470" style="s2">to have a criteria that&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.220" end="00:47:53.900" style="s2">functional in Finland or in one country</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.470" end="00:47:56.390" style="s2">but we can actually use the information</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.900" end="00:47:58.789" style="s2">and knowledge that people have in in all</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.390" end="00:48:01.069" style="s2">different countries in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.789" end="00:48:03.500" style="s2">help and they can help us build that</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.069" end="00:48:05.599" style="s2">criteria that help we can evaluate the</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.500" end="00:48:07.400" style="s2">solutions for these these problems we</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.599" end="00:48:10.160" style="s2">are trying to solve for instance with</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.400" end="00:48:12.289" style="s2">crowdsourcing just that&#39;s one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.160" end="00:48:15.130" style="s2">of the very basic questions that we we</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.289" end="00:48:17.720" style="s2">face as researchers and practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.130" end="00:48:20.020" style="s2">when we are using these new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.720" end="00:48:24.529" style="s2">participatory and more transparent</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.020" end="00:48:27.559" style="s2">democracy because you end up having the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.529" end="00:48:29.059" style="s2">same fundamental question of who is who</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.559" end="00:48:31.430" style="s2">is going to make the decision and if</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.059" end="00:48:33.859" style="s2">that you have you lay out all these</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.430" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">fantastic solutions that might work or</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.859" end="00:48:38.210" style="s2">might be at least worthwhile considering</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:40.970" style="s2">but if there is no change in the system</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.210" end="00:48:43.240" style="s2">if the change is only incremental in the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.970" end="00:48:45.980" style="s2">grassroots level it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.240" end="00:48:48.380" style="s2">transform the whole whole established</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.980" end="00:48:50.270" style="s2">system at all and then the impact that</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.380" end="00:48:52.840" style="s2">the citizens could have that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.270" end="00:48:55.880" style="s2">disappear in between</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.840" end="00:48:57.770" style="s2">okay hey Jake let&#39;s go to Jay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.880" end="00:48:59.300" style="s2">terrific and just keep going to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.770" end="00:49:02.450" style="s2">wants to jump in here and go we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.300" end="00:49:05.810" style="s2">lot of go for tickets yeah so just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.450" end="00:49:07.820" style="s2">quick level up of abstraction with what</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.810" end="00:49:09.650" style="s2">Jordan did there which I love and is</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.820" end="00:49:11.450" style="s2">what you know I&#39;m interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.650" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">process of governance design itself and</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.450" end="00:49:15.020" style="s2">how we even go about that and some</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:17.210" style="s2">structure thinking for getting there so</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.020" end="00:49:19.700" style="s2">I love the step by step method that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.210" end="00:49:21.380" style="s2">Jordan laid out here which was to first</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.700" end="00:49:23.450" style="s2">state your assumptions about what the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.380" end="00:49:26.390" style="s2">problems are to define a design</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.450" end="00:49:28.280" style="s2">challenge as you see it to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.390" end="00:49:29.720" style="s2">the resources that are available the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.280" end="00:49:32.090" style="s2">tools and technologies and other things</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.720" end="00:49:34.190" style="s2">that we have at our disposal and then to</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.090" end="00:49:36.230" style="s2">come up with a prototype so just I want</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.190" end="00:49:38.120" style="s2">to reiterate the the benefit of that</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.230" end="00:49:39.500" style="s2">kind of structure thinking I think we</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.120" end="00:49:42.470" style="s2">don&#39;t hear that much in political</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.500" end="00:49:44.660" style="s2">debates now even with people think about</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.470" end="00:49:46.100" style="s2">this deeply that kind of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.660" end="00:49:47.870" style="s2">discussion and I love the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.100" end="00:49:49.730" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about physics and</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.870" end="00:49:51.890" style="s2">complexity and neuroscience and</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.870" end="00:49:57.800" style="s2">that a little bit as well but all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.610" end="00:49:59.870" style="s2">that is critically important to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.800" end="00:50:01.610" style="s2">discussion and we can&#39;t shortchange that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.870" end="00:50:03.320" style="s2">before we want to run into a policy and</p>

<p begin="00:50:05.600" end="00:50:09.380" style="s2">through I think should should be a model</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.790" end="00:50:11.810" style="s2">that we all follow when we think about</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.810" end="00:50:14.840" style="s2">design it&#39;s just I want to point out</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.430" end="00:50:16.850" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things I&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="00:50:16.850" end="00:50:20.540" style="s2">that hopefully later but one of the key</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.890" end="00:50:26.620" style="s2">tensions that&#39;s coming out already is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.540" end="00:50:26.620" style="s2">this idea of following a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">biological model and the benefits of</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.210" end="00:50:34.250" style="s2">doing that so a hominid based way of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:36.500" style="s2">doing representation ranking and all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.250" end="00:50:40.190" style="s2">that that&#39;s great we also have on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.500" end="00:50:41.810" style="s2">other end which has been discussed the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.190" end="00:50:43.850" style="s2">need to overcome some of these legacy</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.810" end="00:50:47.150" style="s2">features that have come with us the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.850" end="00:50:50.030" style="s2">cognitive biases the short-term thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.150" end="00:50:53.480" style="s2">at the expense of long-term outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.030" end="00:50:55.640" style="s2">some of these artificial techniques that</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.480" end="00:50:57.410" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have to overlay on top of</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.640" end="00:50:59.510" style="s2">some of our biological limitations and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.410" end="00:51:01.310" style="s2">the toggling intention between those</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.510" end="00:51:03.260" style="s2">things that that are organic and come</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.310" end="00:51:04.960" style="s2">naturally that we model it on but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.260" end="00:51:08.589" style="s2">thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.960" end="00:51:10.869" style="s2">artificial improvements that we might</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.589" end="00:51:12.910" style="s2">make with our institutions that we built</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.869" end="00:51:14.530" style="s2">around those systems so just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.910" end="00:51:16.180" style="s2">point out that tension I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.530" end="00:51:17.680" style="s2">getting at and it&#39;s a critical one for</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.180" end="00:51:19.810" style="s2">how we think about designing new</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.680" end="00:51:21.670" style="s2">political systems yeah excellent</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.810" end="00:51:22.570" style="s2">a couple of things just immediately</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.670" end="00:51:24.160" style="s2">spring to mind as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.570" end="00:51:25.349" style="s2">various kind of comments that have come</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.160" end="00:51:29.080" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.349" end="00:51:31.480" style="s2">one synthetically bridging your comment</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.080" end="00:51:33.099" style="s2">Jake with periods yes we do live in an</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.480" end="00:51:36.400" style="s2">environment right now the technical and</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.099" end="00:51:38.290" style="s2">scientific frontier is vastly further</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.400" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">out than our actual institutional</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.290" end="00:51:43.510" style="s2">capabilities take advantage of and so we</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:46.089" style="s2">should be frankly ashamed of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.510" end="00:51:47.380" style="s2">if we were not taking advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.089" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">current cutting edge and insane places</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.380" end="00:51:50.950" style="s2">like evolutionary biology cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:53.170" style="s2">neuroscience complexity systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.950" end="00:51:54.220" style="s2">information technology etc etc when</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.170" end="00:51:55.690" style="s2">we&#39;re building something new because</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.220" end="00:51:57.609" style="s2">only idiots wouldn&#39;t use the best tools</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.690" end="00:51:59.500" style="s2">that they have and I hate being it it an</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.609" end="00:52:00.609" style="s2">idiot and clearly our current</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.500" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">institutional structure was built in</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.609" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">1950s technology across the board right</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:09.099" style="s2">psychology information technology etc</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.660" style="s2">etc the second is just as a quick caveat</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.099" end="00:52:12.310" style="s2">yeah I would not by any stretch to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.660" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">mention you should try to advocate the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.310" end="00:52:17.770" style="s2">notion of constructing something</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:19.750" style="s2">designed to put a golden crown on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.770" end="00:52:22.420" style="s2">hominid it&#39;s rather sort of the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.750" end="00:52:23.950" style="s2">we the the negative condition is that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.420" end="00:52:25.510" style="s2">are likely going to be building some</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.950" end="00:52:27.640" style="s2">sort of governance structure for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.510" end="00:52:29.260" style="s2">purpose of hominids and so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.640" end="00:52:31.150" style="s2">understand that as a design constraint</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.260" end="00:52:32.740" style="s2">and we should have at least some degree</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.150" end="00:52:33.670" style="s2">of optimism that the sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.740" end="00:52:35.770" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about right now are</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.670" end="00:52:37.690" style="s2">possible because hominids or at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.770" end="00:52:39.940" style="s2">capable of this sort of thing at a low</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.690" end="00:52:41.440" style="s2">level without any additional technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.940" end="00:52:43.210" style="s2">and in some sense the challenge is to</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.440" end="00:52:45.130" style="s2">figure out how we can use our our best</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.210" end="00:52:48.339" style="s2">capabilities in science and technology</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.130" end="00:52:50.770" style="s2">to enable something that scales and yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.339" end="00:52:52.619" style="s2">and you know steams a lot of the values</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.770" end="00:52:55.030" style="s2">and virtues that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.619" end="00:52:56.589" style="s2">and the last thing is that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.030" end="00:52:59.589" style="s2">things that popped into my mind at least</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.589" end="00:53:02.740" style="s2">when Tania was talking is that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.589" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">initial assumption that I proposed was</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.740" end="00:53:08.619" style="s2">this notion of the major break and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:12.010" style="s2">is because the you know do you could put</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.619" end="00:53:14.140" style="s2">the most beautiful thing into a garbage</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.010" end="00:53:15.250" style="s2">machine you can take garbage out and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.140" end="00:53:16.900" style="s2">challenges that our current</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.250" end="00:53:18.370" style="s2">institutional structure is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.900" end="00:53:19.810" style="s2">designed to output gar</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.370" end="00:53:21.190" style="s2">regardless of what you put into it it</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.810" end="00:53:23.320" style="s2">has a very large number of implicit</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.190" end="00:53:24.550" style="s2">assumptions about everything right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.320" end="00:53:26.530" style="s2">been doing it for a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.550" end="00:53:29.140" style="s2">time it&#39;s Cluj based upon those</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.530" end="00:53:30.940" style="s2">assumptions and so if your design</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.140" end="00:53:32.260" style="s2">requirement is that you sort of side</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.940" end="00:53:34.090" style="s2">load a very large number of really good</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.260" end="00:53:35.050" style="s2">ideas and then you&#39;re going to implement</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.090" end="00:53:36.550" style="s2">them I put in the back end of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.050" end="00:53:38.100" style="s2">machine in some sense you&#39;re wasting</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.550" end="00:53:41.800" style="s2">your time you might get a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.100" end="00:53:43.390" style="s2">increasing sort of filigree at the edges</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.800" end="00:53:45.820" style="s2">that is existing ly a currently rokoko</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.390" end="00:53:47.470" style="s2">institutional structure but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.820" end="00:53:50.770" style="s2">wasting a very substantial amount of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.470" end="00:53:52.870" style="s2">good work that was put into it actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.770" end="00:53:56.920" style="s2">finally sorry Michelle so walking all</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.870" end="00:53:58.690" style="s2">the way back I can increasingly believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.920" end="00:54:01.150" style="s2">but it&#39;s probably I just said that</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.690" end="00:54:04.840" style="s2">there&#39;s going to have to be a side load</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.150" end="00:54:07.150" style="s2">opt-out peer-to-peer at least peer to</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.840" end="00:54:08.680" style="s2">peer at the local level based governance</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.150" end="00:54:10.870" style="s2">structure that people simply start to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.680" end="00:54:12.910" style="s2">weave up themselves largely leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.870" end="00:54:15.010" style="s2">new ideas and new technologies to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.910" end="00:54:16.360" style="s2">able to build something completely aside</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.010" end="00:54:18.460" style="s2">from the existing governance structures</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.360" end="00:54:20.830" style="s2">and then this is why I highlight the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.460" end="00:54:22.450" style="s2">challenge that at some point there will</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.830" end="00:54:23.710" style="s2">come a tension with the existing elites</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.450" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">and there needs to be some mechanism by</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.710" end="00:54:29.380" style="s2">which this evolving structure deals with</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:34.390" style="s2">hopefully in a piece for a gentle way</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.380" end="00:54:37.870" style="s2">that potential tension you show seems</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.390" end="00:54:41.950" style="s2">like a natural pass to you because go</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.870" end="00:54:44.770" style="s2">ahead jump in this well you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.950" end="00:54:49.090" style="s2">one of the issues that we have to deal</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.770" end="00:54:52.950" style="s2">with is the tension between individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.090" end="00:54:52.950" style="s2">freedom and collective decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.190" end="00:54:59.250" style="s2">and you know when we look at peer</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.260" end="00:55:01.390" style="s2">governance the the self governance of</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.250" end="00:55:03.130" style="s2">communities that create common value</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.390" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">like in free software open hardware</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.130" end="00:55:10.030" style="s2">etcetera one of the things that I like</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:12.160" style="s2">about these systems is that they</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.030" end="00:55:15.010" style="s2">consider democracy as a scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.160" end="00:55:18.070" style="s2">allocation mechanism that doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.010" end="00:55:20.110" style="s2">to apply when there is no scarcity in</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.070" end="00:55:21.790" style="s2">other words there&#39;s a lot of things we</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.110" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">can do as individuals through self</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.790" end="00:55:26.440" style="s2">allocation and self choice so we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:30.760" style="s2">these permissionless systems where</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.440" end="00:55:31.980" style="s2">everybody can contribute and the hard</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.760" end="00:55:34.369" style="s2">issues that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.980" end="00:55:37.410" style="s2">the Democratic issues are relegated to</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.369" end="00:55:40.369" style="s2">when actual when conflicts actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.410" end="00:55:46.650" style="s2">arise and I think this is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.369" end="00:55:49.859" style="s2">kind of way to think about democracy in</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.650" end="00:55:53.550" style="s2">terms of you know making it a lighter</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.859" end="00:55:56.369" style="s2">thing that you know one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.550" end="00:55:58.170" style="s2">that I that I see with activist</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.369" end="00:56:02.430" style="s2">movements and that includes occupy is</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.170" end="00:56:06.150" style="s2">that there is so much process there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.430" end="00:56:09.960" style="s2">much attention on collective</p>

<p begin="00:58:49.460" end="00:58:55.160" style="s2">incentives because Ronan&#39;s model assumes</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.090" end="00:58:57.800" style="s2">that people really want are the citizens</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.160" end="00:58:59.780" style="s2">they really want to participate and also</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.800" end="00:59:02.690" style="s2">that there is like a Latins potential</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.780" end="00:59:05.110" style="s2">for civic engagement and also what the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.690" end="00:59:09.050" style="s2">michelle&#39;s that about peer peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.110" end="00:59:11.000" style="s2">democracy peer to peer economies that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.050" end="00:59:13.850" style="s2">people actually want to want to work</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.000" end="00:59:15.710" style="s2">towards a better society so what would</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.850" end="00:59:17.300" style="s2">be because we have this awesome group of</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.710" end="00:59:19.100" style="s2">people here today so what would be the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.300" end="00:59:21.890" style="s2">incentives that we actually get people</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.100" end="00:59:24.620" style="s2">to participate because I kind of feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.890" end="00:59:26.360" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about elites we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.620" end="00:59:28.670" style="s2">talking about information hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.360" end="00:59:31.250" style="s2">and decision-making hierarchies but that</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.670" end="00:59:32.630" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of like building we have that</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.250" end="00:59:35.540" style="s2">hierarchy already we have a digital</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.630" end="00:59:38.000" style="s2">elite we have the ones who always</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.540" end="00:59:39.470" style="s2">participate online but then we have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.000" end="00:59:41.660" style="s2">big mass of people who might not be</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.470" end="00:59:43.400" style="s2">interested who might not even</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.660" end="00:59:46.580" style="s2">participate even though we brought them</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.400" end="00:59:48.950" style="s2">parties like means to participation to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.580" end="00:59:51.500" style="s2">their hands like laptop iPad or mobile</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.950" end="00:59:53.570" style="s2">phone or probe and connection like we</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.500" end="00:59:55.190" style="s2">have in Finland like almost at every</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.570" end="00:59:57.140" style="s2">household but people might not be</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.190" end="00:59:59.390" style="s2">interested in these topics so how can we</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.140" end="00:59:59.690" style="s2">actually make Jordan&#39;s model work from</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.390" end="01:00:01.130" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.690" end="01:00:07.940" style="s2">rude level what would be your thoughts</p>

<p begin="01:00:07.940" end="01:00:12.099" style="s2">okay well go ahead John or about Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.339" end="01:00:14.119" style="s2">if you want to jump in that tooth I</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.099" end="01:00:15.890" style="s2">think we have a little bit of a bias</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.119" end="01:00:17.420" style="s2">here we we tend to think in terms of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.890" end="01:00:20.920" style="s2">the old style of government the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.420" end="01:00:24.050" style="s2">industrial kind of ubiquitous mass</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.920" end="01:00:26.270" style="s2">ideological forms of governance and men</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.050" end="01:00:28.220" style="s2">were passed ideology ideology is dead I</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.270" end="01:00:30.680" style="s2">mean nobody can agree on anything and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.220" end="01:00:33.280" style="s2">and the only systems that seem to work</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.680" end="01:00:35.750" style="s2">or you know on the p2p side are opted in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.280" end="01:00:37.460" style="s2">there won&#39;t be one single government you</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.750" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">know form of governance and they&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="01:01:07.490" end="01:01:12.950" style="s2">better too you know we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.790" end="01:01:15.470" style="s2">able to produce most of what we consume</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.950" end="01:01:18.470" style="s2">at the local level very very soon I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.470" end="01:01:19.970" style="s2">very very soon if you&#39;re looking at</p>

<p begin="01:02:56.150" end="01:03:00.050" style="s2">build a new toolkit from the bottom up</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.000" end="01:03:03.320" style="s2">and so what that means is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.050" end="01:03:05.360" style="s2">have a so this weird subtle notion that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.320" end="01:03:07.730" style="s2">something is either obviously impossible</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.360" end="01:03:09.470" style="s2">or you have a set of basic tools that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.730" end="01:03:12.830" style="s2">spring to mind that come from something</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.470" end="01:03:14.570" style="s2">that was built in 1947 be aware of that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.830" end="01:03:16.220" style="s2">fact and begin the process of actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.570" end="01:03:17.420" style="s2">thinking about well it&#39;s a 21st century</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.220" end="01:03:18.500" style="s2">approach to that and how might you be</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.420" end="01:03:21.770" style="s2">able to work your way through it and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.500" end="01:03:23.630" style="s2">John just gave a very nice solid 21st</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.770" end="01:03:24.890" style="s2">century approach to how one goes about</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.630" end="01:03:26.420" style="s2">constructing something in an</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.890" end="01:03:29.330" style="s2">autocatalytic fashion which attract</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.420" end="01:03:31.700" style="s2">people to it so and endeavor to do that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.330" end="01:03:33.970" style="s2">to Tonya&#39;s question of incentives I</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.700" end="01:03:37.220" style="s2">think there&#39;s a sort of three-stage</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.970" end="01:03:38.300" style="s2">hierarchy the first incentive and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.220" end="01:03:40.910" style="s2">anything that is constructed to run</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.300" end="01:03:42.200" style="s2">individuals is that individuals must be</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.910" end="01:03:43.670" style="s2">focused on the things that they are most</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.200" end="01:03:45.020" style="s2">passionate about and that sounds like</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.670" end="01:03:48.650" style="s2">hippie talk but in point of fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.020" end="01:03:50.120" style="s2">actually real and most people will not</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.650" end="01:03:51.950" style="s2">be passionate about many of the things</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.120" end="01:03:53.510" style="s2">that are involved in governance and</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.950" end="01:03:55.160" style="s2">that&#39;s fine right it&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.510" end="01:03:58.190" style="s2">passionate about is planting tomatoes</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.160" end="01:04:00.590" style="s2">then you should go plant tomatoes the</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.190" end="01:04:04.400" style="s2">second is that this concept of Commons</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.590" end="01:04:05.990" style="s2">currencies will help individuals sort of</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.400" end="01:04:07.460" style="s2">be oriented towards those things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.990" end="01:04:08.840" style="s2">other people in their social field</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.460" end="01:04:10.190" style="s2">considered to be very important and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.840" end="01:04:12.500" style="s2">which they themselves may be</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.190" end="01:04:13.640" style="s2">particularly capable of doing which may</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.640" end="01:04:17.300" style="s2">passion so in my particular toy model</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.290" end="01:04:19.400" style="s2">example if you have a particular</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.300" end="01:04:20.540" style="s2">grandmother who simply legendary and her</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.400" end="01:04:22.670" style="s2">local community for being able to</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.540" end="01:04:24.650" style="s2">resolve disputes there will be social</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.670" end="01:04:26.510" style="s2">resources allocated to providing her</p>

<p begin="01:04:26.510" end="01:04:30.230" style="s2">money for doing what it is she has</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.820" end="01:04:31.970" style="s2">esteem for doing within her local</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.230" end="01:04:33.140" style="s2">community or by the way if she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.970" end="01:04:35.450" style="s2">terrible at it she could still do it she</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.140" end="01:04:37.010" style="s2">just won&#39;t make as much headway he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.450" end="01:04:38.450" style="s2">be given as much access pretty good to</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.010" end="01:04:40.820" style="s2">do that by the sort of matching</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.450" end="01:04:42.680" style="s2">algorithm the third and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.820" end="01:04:46.940" style="s2">crucial as part of our cognitive toolkit</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.680" end="01:04:48.500" style="s2">is the the notion of governance I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.940" end="01:04:51.260" style="s2">we need to have this basic model that</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.500" end="01:04:55.970" style="s2">every individual doesn&#39;t really ever</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.260" end="01:04:57.920" style="s2">desire to have a voice with the desire</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.970" end="01:05:00.650" style="s2">to have is often Ted authenticity in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.920" end="01:05:01.960" style="s2">environment they&#39;re engaged so if the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.650" end="01:05:04.070" style="s2">people I&#39;m surrounded with are</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.960" end="01:05:07.190" style="s2">authentically engaging in good faith to</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.070" end="01:05:08.510" style="s2">try to solve problems and I feel good</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.190" end="01:05:10.370" style="s2">about the fact that they&#39;re doing so</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.510" end="01:05:12.320" style="s2">then that&#39;s what I really want right I</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.370" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">don&#39;t care whether I&#39;m with a bus driver</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.320" end="01:05:17.390" style="s2">an airline pilot or somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:18.770" style="s2">working on my water system that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.390" end="01:05:21.380" style="s2">thing you&#39;re really looking for</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.770" end="01:05:22.880" style="s2">so we&#39;re designed for that oddly enough</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.380" end="01:05:24.620" style="s2">this notion of designing for giving</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:27.200" style="s2">universal suffrage or giving a voice is</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.620" end="01:05:29.300" style="s2">another example of a kludge that well</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.200" end="01:05:30.410" style="s2"> if I can&#39;t count on authenticity or</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.300" end="01:05:31.550" style="s2">if I don&#39;t have any mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.410" end="01:05:33.410" style="s2">transparency where I feel good about</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.550" end="01:05:34.760" style="s2">that actually happening then I need to</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.410" end="01:05:35.960" style="s2">be willing to go in and wait in myself</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.760" end="01:05:37.160" style="s2">like I&#39;m stressed through my elbows</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.960" end="01:05:39.440" style="s2">around to make sure that I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.160" end="01:05:43.210" style="s2">voice as opposed to actually having an</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.440" end="01:05:43.210" style="s2">authentic community that engaged it</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.950" end="01:05:48.830" style="s2">wants to jump in which is great but I</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.420" end="01:05:50.150" style="s2">will say this I just want to say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.830" end="01:05:51.890" style="s2">actually getting quite a few questions</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.150" end="01:05:54.170" style="s2">from outside in the audience and</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.890" end="01:05:55.940" style="s2">fantastic ones I will see one I would</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.170" end="01:05:57.260" style="s2">loop somebody&#39;s into the panel here we</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.940" end="01:05:58.850" style="s2">might be able to deal with a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.260" end="01:06:00.260" style="s2">them here but the general thought here</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.850" end="01:06:02.480" style="s2">is there seems to be people from outside</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.260" end="01:06:03.710" style="s2">words are trying to talk about examples</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.480" end="01:06:05.630" style="s2">of things that are already working</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.710" end="01:06:07.970" style="s2">somehow someone mentioned how the anti</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.630" end="01:06:09.980" style="s2">anti SOPA efforts you know helped</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.970" end="01:06:13.940" style="s2">pressure the existing system to move in</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.980" end="01:06:15.980" style="s2">at least the right direction or we have</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.940" end="01:06:18.140" style="s2">someone in G+ talked about how it would</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.980" end="01:06:19.790" style="s2">there be ways to tweak the tax system to</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.140" end="01:06:21.170" style="s2">start moving more in this direction and</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.790" end="01:06:21.980" style="s2">so there&#39;s something to be thinking</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.170" end="01:06:24.230" style="s2">about because I know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.980" end="01:06:25.970" style="s2">concern of like there&#39;s an extract ideal</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.230" end="01:06:27.680" style="s2">way to think about this there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.970" end="01:06:29.450" style="s2">kind of what can we do here and now kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.680" end="01:06:32.390" style="s2">of what I think it&#39;s useful to put it</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.450" end="01:06:33.770" style="s2">out there but on the other hand let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.390" end="01:06:35.150" style="s2">let&#39;s go to Brett Brett you want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.770" end="01:06:38.300" style="s2">about this it&#39;s opt-in thing and then</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.150" end="01:06:40.040" style="s2">maybe Jake yeah I wanted to disentangle</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.300" end="01:06:43.220" style="s2">two things just so we don&#39;t end up</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.040" end="01:06:46.400" style="s2">confused so John&#39;s point if I understand</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.220" end="01:06:48.560" style="s2">it was that things that are not opt-in</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.400" end="01:06:50.060" style="s2">things that are coercive don&#39;t function</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.560" end="01:06:53.900" style="s2">in the modern environment and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.060" end="01:06:56.120" style="s2">certainly some truth to that but he</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.900" end="01:06:57.980" style="s2">suggests that the future of governance</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.120" end="01:06:59.510" style="s2">will therefore have to be opted in and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.980" end="01:07:03.470" style="s2">just want to point out that at a game</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.510" end="01:07:05.440" style="s2">theoretic level pending your assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.470" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to imagine something that will</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.440" end="01:07:10.580" style="s2">function to accomplish what needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:13.490" style="s2">accomplished and the opt-in in other</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.580" end="01:07:16.400" style="s2">words if somebody wants not to opt into</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.490" end="01:07:20.840" style="s2">your system of government and to build</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.400" end="01:07:24.860" style="s2">nuclear reactors that are unsafe to</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.840" end="01:07:27.410" style="s2">operate they can&#39;t be allowed to do it</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.860" end="01:07:29.870" style="s2">if the costs of those nuclear reactors</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.410" end="01:07:33.260" style="s2">when they come apart is borne by other</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.870" end="01:07:37.990" style="s2">people perhaps did opt in and when you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.260" end="01:07:42.080" style="s2">look at the way in particular energy is</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.990" end="01:07:45.170" style="s2">delivered in the modern context it is if</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.080" end="01:07:46.940" style="s2">if you allow those who wish to opt out</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.170" end="01:07:49.100" style="s2">of your system of governance to do so</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.940" end="01:07:51.140" style="s2">and then to procure energy and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.100" end="01:07:53.720" style="s2">distribute it in any way they want that</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.140" end="01:07:55.760" style="s2">effectively I believe we&#39;ve surrendered</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.720" end="01:07:57.230" style="s2">the ability to govern and we will simply</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.760" end="01:07:59.600" style="s2">suffer the fate of whatever choices</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.230" end="01:08:00.380" style="s2">those who have not opted in have made</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.600" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.380" end="01:08:05.720" style="s2">so and then Jordan picks up the point of</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.090" style="s2">opt in from a different perspective</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.720" end="01:08:10.460" style="s2">which is that not everybody needs to</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.090" end="01:08:12.230" style="s2">participate in architecting government</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.460" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">which really this is a place where we</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.230" end="01:08:19.010" style="s2">truly can be opt in it&#39;s not an it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:21.859" style="s2">something everyone has a interest in</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.010" end="01:08:22.970" style="s2">thinking about and indeed most people</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.859" end="01:08:25.190" style="s2">don&#39;t need to think about it for</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.970" end="01:08:27.280" style="s2">governance to function properly but they</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.190" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">really are two very different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.280" end="01:08:34.370" style="s2">opt-in and the first one I believe</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.839" end="01:08:37.430" style="s2">simply can&#39;t be made to function so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.370" end="01:08:39.920" style="s2">I have another tangental point hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.430" end="01:08:42.220" style="s2">relevant on opt-in and representation in</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.920" end="01:08:45.440" style="s2">fact going back to Jordan&#39;s idea of</p>

<p begin="01:09:35.900" end="01:09:40.670" style="s2">think about other entities that need to</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.630" end="01:09:43.070" style="s2">be considered that need to be governed</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.350" end="01:10:45.910" style="s2">mean I might I might just as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.330" end="01:10:46.840" style="s2">looking at as we started to turn the</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.910" end="01:10:49.360" style="s2">corner here a little bit on the</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.840" end="01:10:50.710" style="s2">conversation um it&#39;s possible just</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.360" end="01:10:52.330" style="s2">hearing what everyone&#39;s saying here that</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.710" end="01:10:54.430" style="s2">you could imagine that kind of an</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.330" end="01:10:57.460" style="s2">emergent situation here where where the</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.430" end="01:10:59.500" style="s2">opt-in systems that would essentially be</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.460" end="01:11:02.440" style="s2">aiming for this more superior way of</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.500" end="01:11:04.300" style="s2">governance would essentially be an</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.440" end="01:11:05.950" style="s2">opt-in situation and would just prove</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.300" end="01:11:07.930" style="s2">the concepts and actually would you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.950" end="01:11:09.940" style="s2">at a local level potentially and at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.930" end="01:11:13.660" style="s2">better a fractal and scalable kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.940" end="01:11:15.880" style="s2">design level and that over time you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.660" end="01:11:17.320" style="s2">it might compete or start to compete</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.880" end="01:11:20.200" style="s2">with the existing system and then that</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.320" end="01:11:21.940" style="s2">then the ultimate kind of clash or</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.200" end="01:11:23.530" style="s2">transition is something we might be</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.940" end="01:11:25.060" style="s2">pointing to here but there is for a</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.530" end="01:11:26.530" style="s2">while at least you could imagine an</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.060" end="01:11:28.210" style="s2">opt-in system being the way that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.530" end="01:11:30.010" style="s2">could actually get the the initial work</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.210" end="01:11:31.450" style="s2">on on this in a way that would start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.010" end="01:11:33.190" style="s2">prove the concept in ways that is very</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.450" end="01:11:34.810" style="s2">abstract and difficult for people to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.190" end="01:11:36.580" style="s2">now and I know there was a kind of talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.810" end="01:11:38.530" style="s2">earlier in the side chat here with the</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.580" end="01:11:40.270" style="s2">group here about how in the past</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.530" end="01:11:42.430" style="s2">historically we&#39;ve watched essentially</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.270" end="01:11:44.950" style="s2">old systems essentially new systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.430" end="01:11:46.420" style="s2">emerged alongside the existing systems</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.950" end="01:11:48.460" style="s2">like you know early cap of them with</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.420" end="01:11:50.470" style="s2">feudalism and then over time the one</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.460" end="01:11:52.180" style="s2">just kind of being superiority and</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.470" end="01:11:53.830" style="s2">attract more kind of folks and there is</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.180" end="01:11:55.690" style="s2">a kind of natural kind of collapsing on</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.830" end="01:11:56.920" style="s2">the other systems to I mean gonna be too</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.690" end="01:11:58.480" style="s2">idealistic but there&#39;s some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.920" end="01:12:00.010" style="s2">thoughts there and folks who we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.480" end="01:12:04.710" style="s2">chatting on the side might want to jump</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.010" end="01:12:04.710" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;d like to hear Michels</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.710" end="01:12:15.289" style="s2">yes well I you know I think we we cannot</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.809" end="01:12:18.650" style="s2">confuse the governance of small groups</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.289" end="01:12:21.590" style="s2">where people are voluntary joining them</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.650" end="01:12:24.559" style="s2">and therefore give legitimacy to</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.590" end="01:12:26.630" style="s2">whatever choices they make inside the</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.559" end="01:12:30.559" style="s2">group where opt-in for example is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.630" end="01:12:32.780" style="s2">totally natural phenomena but we all</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.559" end="01:12:36.710" style="s2">also live on a territory with other</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.780" end="01:12:39.050" style="s2">people who may totally disagree with our</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.710" end="01:12:43.999" style="s2">options and so I don&#39;t think that we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.050" end="01:12:47.630" style="s2">have an automatic jump from looking at</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.999" end="01:12:50.989" style="s2">affinity groups virtual groups resilient</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.630" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">communities to the field in which they</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.989" end="01:12:54.920" style="s2">operate together which for me is you</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:57.440" style="s2">know is the field of the poet&#39;s now that</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.920" end="01:13:00.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t learn one from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.440" end="01:13:04.249" style="s2">other but we can&#39;t make the assumption</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.079" end="01:13:06.199" style="s2">that an opt-in decision by a few self</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.249" end="01:13:08.659" style="s2">judging experts in a political domain</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.199" end="01:13:09.920" style="s2">has any legitimacy for all the people</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.659" end="01:13:14.449" style="s2">who are not involved so this is why I</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.920" end="01:13:17.239" style="s2">think we we need to be very careful in</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.449" end="01:13:18.590" style="s2">our assumption that we can just jump you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.239" end="01:13:22.489" style="s2">know from one practice to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.590" end="01:13:23.989" style="s2">generalization of the practice we you</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.489" end="01:13:25.849" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know what form the polis</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.989" end="01:13:29.329" style="s2">will take you know it may not be the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.849" end="01:13:32.210" style="s2">nation-state but I&#39;m pretty sure that we</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.329" end="01:13:34.849" style="s2">will have territorial entities where we</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.210" end="01:13:37.699" style="s2">need to make decisions together all the</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.849" end="01:13:40.010" style="s2">citizens not just you know those who opt</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.699" end="01:13:43.090" style="s2">in or are particularly motivated to</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.010" end="01:13:43.090" style="s2">solve particular problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.110" end="01:13:53.250" style="s2">so actually I don&#39;t know Jordan if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.170" end="01:13:55.250" style="s2">want jump in there but I will say this</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.250" end="01:13:58.110" style="s2">we&#39;re at about 15 minutes left and</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.250" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">obviously we&#39;ve teed up a ton of issues</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.110" end="01:14:02.370" style="s2">here Jordan putting it out a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:05.550" style="s2">reaction to a lot of kind of pushes and</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.370" end="01:14:08.010" style="s2">pulls on where to go here and given the</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.550" end="01:14:10.230" style="s2">finite quality of this gathering here we</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.010" end="01:14:12.450" style="s2">might start thinking about you know the</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.230" end="01:14:14.760" style="s2">kind of if we were to continue this</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.450" end="01:14:16.890" style="s2">conversation you know some of what are</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.760" end="01:14:18.420" style="s2">the kind of really rich and deep veins</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.890" end="01:14:19.650" style="s2">that kind of issue areas the questions</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.420" end="01:14:22.260" style="s2">that you know that would be interesting</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.650" end="01:14:23.580" style="s2">to kind of move next just to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.260" end="01:14:25.500" style="s2">start to think but but I think I would</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.580" end="01:14:27.720" style="s2">rather go back to Jordan right now and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.500" end="01:14:29.790" style="s2">as you start thinking about 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.720" end="01:14:31.140" style="s2">out here what are you learning and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.790" end="01:14:32.820" style="s2">hearing and where would you see the</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.140" end="01:14:34.530" style="s2">thing going and what kind of things are</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.820" end="01:14:35.880" style="s2">starting to emerge to you for what might</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.530" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">be next</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.880" end="01:14:44.640" style="s2">yeah first I&#39;m not going to reframe I</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.320" end="01:14:46.100" style="s2">think the Michelle&#39;s point within the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.640" end="01:14:48.720" style="s2">original framework that I laid out</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.100" end="01:14:51.510" style="s2">because I want to contextualise it and</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.720" end="01:14:52.170" style="s2">this sort of emerging I think at least</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.510" end="01:14:55.350" style="s2">in my head</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.170" end="01:14:57.960" style="s2">John&#39;s experience in Michelle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.350" end="01:14:59.580" style="s2">experience so the places that the</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.960" end="01:15:02.040" style="s2">Michelle points out we have a police</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.580" end="01:15:03.870" style="s2">where groups of individuals are in</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.040" end="01:15:07.730" style="s2">physical proximity yet have very</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.870" end="01:15:09.630" style="s2">disparate sets of value structures are</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.730" end="01:15:11.990" style="s2">precisely the places where I would</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.630" end="01:15:16.020" style="s2">locate this design requirement for</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.990" end="01:15:18.840" style="s2">delivering on active piece and this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.020" end="01:15:22.350" style="s2">very much informed by John&#39;s insight</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.840" end="01:15:24.390" style="s2">that the ability to enforce police power</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.350" end="01:15:26.700" style="s2">in a top-down fashion on any group of</p>

<p begin="01:15:38.730" end="01:15:45.390" style="s2">to get very good at identifying the</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.810" end="01:16:15.800" style="s2">I think my initial response is that this</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.630" end="01:16:17.960" style="s2">I thought this actually went quite well</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.800" end="01:16:21.290" style="s2">I think we got our feet underneath</p>

<p begin="01:16:23.150" end="01:16:27.230" style="s2">extent expected we were able to jump</p>

<p begin="01:16:27.230" end="01:16:33.170" style="s2">sure the people out there in the larger</p>

<p begin="01:16:33.170" end="01:16:36.170" style="s2">heads with some of the things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.550" end="01:16:38.540" style="s2">ended up talking about and frankly</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.170" end="01:16:42.230" style="s2">talking about rather fluidly I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.540" end="01:16:44.870" style="s2">quick quick shout out to Lerman Leyland</p>

<p begin="01:16:44.870" end="01:16:49.730" style="s2">right and that is the right way to think</p>

<p begin="01:16:49.730" end="01:16:54.260" style="s2">in more of a networked environment do</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.280" end="01:16:56.420" style="s2">you want to just you will just mention</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.260" end="01:16:59.080" style="s2">what you talked about there that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.420" end="01:17:02.480" style="s2">referencing a G+ actually I mentioned</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.050" end="01:17:15.290" style="s2">some of the some of that anyhow there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.670" end="01:17:16.910" style="s2">a kind of idea of how do we start</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.290" end="01:17:18.380" style="s2">working with the system even in this way</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.910" end="01:17:20.420" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re referring to Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.380" end="01:17:22.130" style="s2">yeah yeah and it is that there&#39;s models</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.420" end="01:17:25.310" style="s2">that you can employ novel concepts likes</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.130" end="01:17:27.230" style="s2">comments currencies and information rich</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.310" end="01:17:28.490" style="s2">networks to deliver a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.230" end="01:17:30.470" style="s2">that he&#39;s talking about in the fashion</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.490" end="01:17:31.070" style="s2">which is actually pragmatic not</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.470" end="01:17:33.200" style="s2">hand-wavy</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.070" end="01:17:34.370" style="s2">I think frankly would I&#39;d like to do is</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.200" end="01:17:37.370" style="s2">I&#39;d like to get the next steps from</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.370" end="01:17:40.370" style="s2">everybody else and see where the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.370" end="01:17:41.810" style="s2">the conceptual tensions actually are</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.370" end="01:17:43.670" style="s2">located I think John and Michelle&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.810" end="01:17:45.680" style="s2">conceptual tensions got a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.670" end="01:17:46.760" style="s2">opportunity for creative bridging and</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.680" end="01:17:48.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a place that I think we can get a</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.760" end="01:17:50.270" style="s2">lot of value out of doing work on that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.530" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">particular piece at some point in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.270" end="01:17:54.950" style="s2">future well we do this when we go around</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:56.270" style="s2">with a roundtable because it is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.950" end="01:17:58.340" style="s2">getting to the towards the end here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.270" end="01:18:00.140" style="s2">what doesn&#39;t everyone just kind of tf1</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.340" end="01:18:02.390" style="s2">kind of way to think about it is if</p>

<p begin="01:18:08.660" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">a fun way to think about this as a way</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.180" end="01:18:16.370" style="s2">of some amp or at least just give you</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:18.020" style="s2">I&#39;m what you&#39;d like to see next is if</p>

<p begin="01:18:29.900" end="01:18:36.320" style="s2">felt and I think will be highly useful</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.570" end="01:18:41.120" style="s2">to discuss in more detail is and I will</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.320" end="01:18:43.910" style="s2">call it sort of John Michell tension the</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.730" end="01:19:03.050" style="s2">correct and whatever the correct answer</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.220" end="01:19:05.000" style="s2">is is extremely valuable now who wants</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.050" end="01:19:08.240" style="s2">to go next John go for it you look like</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.000" end="01:19:15.470" style="s2">you&#39;re leaning in there no no how do you</p>

<p begin="01:19:47.360" end="01:19:50.510" style="s2">really not my thing</p>

<p begin="01:22:12.140" end="01:22:17.510" style="s2">as well as it works in Finland and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.350" end="01:22:19.600" style="s2">optimistic that with changes in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.510" end="01:22:21.770" style="s2">current system we can actually increase</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.600" end="01:22:23.300" style="s2">people&#39;s ability to self govern</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.770" end="01:22:26.900" style="s2">themselves and that&#39;s that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.300" end="01:22:28.850" style="s2">happening so I&#39;m not ready to throw the</p>

<p begin="01:22:28.850" end="01:22:33.920" style="s2">because I think it doesn&#39;t belong there</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.950" end="01:22:35.900" style="s2">and also I&#39;m very pragmatic so I want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.920" end="01:22:37.160" style="s2">see change happening starting from now</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.900" end="01:22:38.810" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.160" end="01:22:41.470" style="s2">to work with with the current system</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.810" end="01:22:43.820" style="s2">because I can see the change immediately</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.470" end="01:22:46.550" style="s2">and also if my research shows that</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.820" end="01:22:49.040" style="s2">people are not like even though there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.550" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">a lot of distrust in in the current</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.040" end="01:22:54.380" style="s2">governmental forms but there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:56.690" style="s2">also trust and also content like</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.380" end="01:22:59.300" style="s2">satisfaction with some of some parts of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.690" end="01:23:01.670" style="s2">it so we should build on the positive</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.300" end="01:23:04.700" style="s2">sides and try to improve the negative</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.670" end="01:23:07.790" style="s2">sides and going forward so I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.700" end="01:23:10.730" style="s2">hear more about existing functional</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.790" end="01:23:13.370" style="s2">models of transparency transparency in</p>

<p begin="01:23:13.370" end="01:23:18.560" style="s2">policymaking and and learn from best</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.010" end="01:23:21.230" style="s2">practices and listen like lessons what</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.560" end="01:23:23.870" style="s2">others other people have learned all</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.230" end="01:23:25.370" style="s2">around the world in these experiments</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.870" end="01:23:29.180" style="s2">and I would like to have like maybe a</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.370" end="01:23:31.700" style="s2">little bit more global approach in terms</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.180" end="01:23:35.240" style="s2">of I just heard that for instance in</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.700" end="01:23:37.310" style="s2">South Korea there is sort of increase in</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.240" end="01:23:39.350" style="s2">the use of participatory budgeting for</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.310" end="01:23:41.120" style="s2">instance so that was news to me I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.350" end="01:23:44.180" style="s2">to hear more about that so it&#39;d be great</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.120" end="01:23:48.710" style="s2">to collect some more global experts and</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.180" end="01:23:50.480" style="s2">and hear from those experiments like it</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.710" end="01:23:52.640" style="s2">Jake do you want to jump in with what</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.480" end="01:23:55.760" style="s2">would where would you go next thinking</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.640" end="01:23:59.980" style="s2">but this I want to help design a</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.760" end="01:23:59.980" style="s2">political system for our Mars colony</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.490" end="01:24:05.570" style="s2">explain that a little bit I kind of get</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.660" end="01:24:09.680" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying but give me some ah I</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.570" end="01:24:11.870" style="s2">couldn&#39;t leave it like that I it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.680" end="01:24:13.370" style="s2">gonna happen for a while but every time</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.870" end="01:24:15.290" style="s2">humans have moved to a new place they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.370" end="01:24:18.440" style="s2">come up with a new political system so</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.290" end="01:24:21.230" style="s2">the exhaust even the idea of designing a</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.440" end="01:24:23.090" style="s2">political system for a Mars colony or a</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.230" end="01:24:25.190" style="s2">sea setting Institute or wherever we</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.090" end="01:24:27.080" style="s2">want to go the idea and the license to</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.190" end="01:24:29.600" style="s2">think about that will pay dividends here</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.080" end="01:24:31.790" style="s2">on earth so I want people to think about</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.600" end="01:24:33.080" style="s2">that use that tool use that opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.790" end="01:24:34.970" style="s2">to think about if we took a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.080" end="01:24:37.270" style="s2">thousand people to Mars what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.970" end="01:24:39.530" style="s2">system will be built where one person</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.270" end="01:24:41.630" style="s2">when empowered individual could do so</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.530" end="01:24:43.960" style="s2">much damage if we had a dome one on the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.630" end="01:24:46.550" style="s2">colony for example so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.960" end="01:24:48.290" style="s2">interesting constraints and ideas and</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.550" end="01:24:50.120" style="s2">license and opportunities to think about</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.290" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">political systems here on earth by</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.120" end="01:24:53.930" style="s2">giving ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:56.300" style="s2">that vision of a Mars colony so I want</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.930" end="01:24:57.440" style="s2">to I want to design that now I love I</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.300" end="01:24:59.690" style="s2">love that idea maybe we&#39;ll have to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.440" end="01:25:01.060" style="s2">one of those Brett do you have a few</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.690" end="01:25:04.160" style="s2">thoughts and then and then we&#39;ll go to</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.060" end="01:25:07.750" style="s2">you shovel right fun ideas</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.160" end="01:25:10.010" style="s2">absolutely I think the central issue</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.750" end="01:25:12.410" style="s2">from my perspective would be the one</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.010" end="01:25:15.200" style="s2">that Jake raised about the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.410" end="01:25:17.390" style="s2">biases that we have and in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.200" end="01:25:18.950" style="s2">it&#39;s the hardest to deal with because of</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.390" end="01:25:21.020" style="s2">course we have cognitive biases that</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.950" end="01:25:24.260" style="s2">make it impossible to see what it is</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.020" end="01:25:26.630" style="s2">that we don&#39;t yet understand but um you</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.260" end="01:25:30.260" style="s2">know we unfortunately are like all</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.630" end="01:25:32.060" style="s2">evolved creatures we are adapted to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.260" end="01:25:34.040" style="s2">environment from which we came and we</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.060" end="01:25:36.650" style="s2">don&#39;t live there anymore and the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.040" end="01:25:38.090" style="s2">problems that we are arranged here in</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.650" end="01:25:39.860" style="s2">this roundtable talking about are</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.090" end="01:25:42.410" style="s2">largely the result of the disconnect</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.860" end="01:25:46.400" style="s2">between what we are evolved to intuit</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.410" end="01:25:48.950" style="s2">and what our actual constraints are so I</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.400" end="01:25:52.460" style="s2">would like to see us unpack what our</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.950" end="01:25:55.190" style="s2">biases are and what a system that</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.460" end="01:25:59.180" style="s2">corrected for them would inherently have</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.190" end="01:26:00.500" style="s2">to look like I said yeah great idea well</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.180" end="01:26:02.330" style="s2">maybe dudes or some like that let me</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.500" end="01:26:04.130" style="s2">show did you have some thoughts on what</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.330" end="01:26:06.620" style="s2">where would you go next and what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.130" end="01:26:08.120" style="s2">want to think through yes oh well you</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.620" end="01:26:11.420" style="s2">know when I look at the tension that</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.120" end="01:26:15.080" style="s2">that people see between join me I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.420" end="01:26:17.660" style="s2">the way I would formulate it is that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.080" end="01:26:20.989" style="s2">live in a two-speed society in other</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.660" end="01:26:22.940" style="s2">words we have a rapidly self-organizing</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.989" end="01:26:23.620" style="s2">civil society that is operating on a</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.940" end="01:26:26.630" style="s2">global scale</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.620" end="01:26:31.010" style="s2">that&#39;s inventing new forms of governance</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.630" end="01:26:35.510" style="s2">in democracy and then we have a much</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.010" end="01:26:38.270" style="s2">slower democratic governance system that</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.510" end="01:26:41.620" style="s2">is a bit in crisis and that seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.270" end="01:26:44.630" style="s2">except maybe for Finland quite slow in</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.620" end="01:26:50.540" style="s2">in adapting new practices so I think the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.630" end="01:26:53.630" style="s2">key is the bridge is that we we have to</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.540" end="01:26:58.219" style="s2">find a way that representative democracy</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.630" end="01:27:00.680" style="s2">can look at civic practices and inspire</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.219" end="01:27:02.989" style="s2">itself by these new civic practices and</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.680" end="01:27:04.850" style="s2">one a particular thing that I think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.989" end="01:27:07.820" style="s2">we should really be pushing is</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.850" end="01:27:09.770" style="s2">see boring which is different from</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.820" end="01:27:13.100" style="s2">obtained right you proxy voting is the</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.770" end="01:27:16.520" style="s2">ability to choose people that you trust</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.100" end="01:27:19.550" style="s2">to choose in your place and to retake</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.520" end="01:27:21.740" style="s2">that vote whenever you lose a trust and</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.550" end="01:27:23.630" style="s2">so my feeling is that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.740" end="01:27:27.260" style="s2">democracy based on batch processing</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.630" end="01:27:30.610" style="s2">based on a computing vision of the 50s</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.260" end="01:27:34.340" style="s2">and the question is how can we modify</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.610" end="01:27:36.410" style="s2">the existing forms of governance and how</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.340" end="01:27:39.380" style="s2">can how can we experiment so that it</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.410" end="01:27:41.690" style="s2">becomes acceptable to change the</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.380" end="01:27:47.120" style="s2">existing form so this is for me an</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.690" end="01:27:49.220" style="s2">important debate love it what these have</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.120" end="01:27:51.110" style="s2">been some fantastic ideas let&#39;s go back</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.220" end="01:27:53.150" style="s2">to Jordan and Jordan what what are you</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.110" end="01:27:56.360" style="s2">hearing is we kind of look in a head</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.150" end="01:27:57.890" style="s2">here we got a couple minutes how about</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.360" end="01:28:00.260" style="s2">some final synthesis from you and</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.890" end="01:28:01.280" style="s2">thoughts on what what what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.260" end="01:28:02.860" style="s2">accomplished here and what you might</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.280" end="01:28:05.360" style="s2">think of next</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.860" end="01:28:06.380" style="s2">yeah I think the the the key synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.360" end="01:28:11.420" style="s2">or at least the key message that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.380" end="01:28:13.670" style="s2">receiving is that people should have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.420" end="01:28:15.620" style="s2">higher degree of optimism than many</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.670" end="01:28:18.920" style="s2">people currently have about our ability</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.620" end="01:28:21.200" style="s2">to actually not fall into a collective</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.920" end="01:28:22.610" style="s2">failure of imagination when I take a</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.200" end="01:28:23.930" style="s2">look over where michelle&#39;s focused</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.610" end="01:28:25.340" style="s2">I believe what ended up happening is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.930" end="01:28:27.680" style="s2">Michelle is focused specifically on what</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.340" end="01:28:30.350" style="s2">I would call transformation which is the</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.680" end="01:28:33.500" style="s2">bridge right and and we may actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.350" end="01:28:35.060" style="s2">share some commonality on what the the</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.500" end="01:28:36.380" style="s2">end state looks like and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.060" end="01:28:38.510" style="s2">some sort of creative tension and with</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.380" end="01:28:39.590" style="s2">the transition area states look like and</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.510" end="01:28:40.940" style="s2">more specifically we can actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.590" end="01:28:43.280" style="s2">collaborate on figuring out how to make</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.940" end="01:28:44.900" style="s2">those bridges work as long as we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.280" end="01:28:47.660" style="s2">sin and share some basic assumptions for</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.900" end="01:28:49.310" style="s2">example that we&#39;re gonna have to figure</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.660" end="01:28:52.520" style="s2">out a way I think a large part of his</p>
