<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">um i&#39;d always tended to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.759" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">of of the great of the four great</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.199" style="s2">ancient traditions epicureanism</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">stoicism aristotelianism and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.199" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">i always tended to regard uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:40.160" style="s2">epicureanism as</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">as sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.160" end="00:04:43.919" style="s2">the well-meaning but not that too bright</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">cousin</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.919" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">of that family um i thought there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.120" style="s2">some value in it but i i saw much more</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:54.160" style="s2">value in stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.120" end="00:04:55.840" style="s2">and you know platonism um the reason i</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.160" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">don&#39;t mention aristotelianism</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.840" end="00:05:02.160" style="s2">is that uh aristotelianism is taken up</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">into uh neoplatonism</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.160" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been deeply appreciative of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.919" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">getting to teach you guys about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.400" style="s2">i have discovered that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:13.520" style="s2">reciprocal relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.400" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">at least for my pedagogy that i learn</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.520" end="00:05:17.120" style="s2">the best when i&#39;m teaching others and i</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">teach</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.120" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">others the best when i&#39;m sharing my</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">and so once again i guess i&#39;ve come</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:36.880" style="s2">this question agency if you have dabbled</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">in other practice and feel so the so</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.880" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">feel see those things interfering can</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2">you compartmentalize them with the word</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:43.039" style="s2">like compartmentalizing to leave them</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">while focusing on the psychology yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">so you can just label them</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">right put them aside um precisely</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">they&#39;re interfering um and</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be an important practice</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">i&#39;m glad you brought that up because as</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">i mentioned i recommend you like so</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">you&#39;re cultivating your ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">practice here&#39;s a particular perennial</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:14.159" style="s2">problem you want to address perhaps it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">you know an issue of self-deception or</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.159" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:20.000" style="s2">particular reciprocal narrowing okay so</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">what practice can i do that will afford</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.000" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">a reciprocal opening and what i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:24.880" style="s2">to do is i&#39;m going to try a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:27.679" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.880" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">try them on and then select the one that</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.679" end="00:25:32.240" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:34.000" style="s2">transfers to my life not just feels the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.240" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">vest while i&#39;m practicing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:41.679" style="s2">that is an insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:44.000" style="s2">guide the one that seems to transfer</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.679" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">transformative transference with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.000" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">ones that transfers most transformation</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">to my life</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">that&#39;s the practice i take up so i pick</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">a perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:57.440" style="s2">right i pick up practice and then i try</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">a variety and then i&#39;m going to look for</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.440" end="00:26:00.799" style="s2">the one that&#39;s transformative that might</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.200" style="s2">not be the one that my mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.799" end="00:26:04.240" style="s2">initially enjoys the most or likes the</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.200" end="00:26:06.880" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.240" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">right sometimes it is but sometimes it</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.880" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">and so when aiden&#39;s pointing out once we</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:13.760" style="s2">do that selection we need to sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">we&#39;ve been practicing these other ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.760" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">and we&#39;ve built up a bit of habit around</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:17.679" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">and we need to put them aside we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.679" end="00:26:21.440" style="s2">put them aside and we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">sort of gently label them yes and</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.440" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">they&#39;re just putting them aside</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">and returning to the practice it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:30.000" style="s2">much like what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:31.279" style="s2">in the meditative practice so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">aiden for saying that</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.279" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">and for bringing that up i think that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">a very astute</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:37.760" style="s2">and helpful thing especially there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">kairos around it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.760" end="00:26:43.679" style="s2">at this time the timing of what you said</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">i think is very well placed</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.679" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">uh mark uh hey mark uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:50.640" style="s2">observation tried some saving today but</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">i have a messy office and not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.640" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">connections came up for me</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s laid out much like my mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">all over the place yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">um very good observation that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">um i i i i use the metaphor but i should</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.039" style="s2">emphasize it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">uh so uh mcclelland&#39;s metaphor that</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.039" end="00:27:09.279" style="s2">epicureanism is about being in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:11.440" style="s2">garden</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.279" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">and savoring should be sort of turning</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.440" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">something into a garden</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">now eventually that will be possible</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">sort of no matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:21.360" style="s2">where you are uh but it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">idea to do this practice for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.360" end="00:27:24.000" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:25.279" style="s2">in a natural setting uh that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.000" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.279" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">you know machinery there&#39;s the bio fight</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.919" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">philia hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">uh that we and there&#39;s increasing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">evidence that we&#39;re in when we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">natural settings</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.520" style="s2">we move to a more optimal functioning so</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.799" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">uh do the savoring or drinking some</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:33.600" style="s2">uh with rafe and he has his own channel</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:35.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.600" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">and so i recommend very strongly that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.360" end="00:33:40.320" style="s2">you spend</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:42.799" style="s2">a lot of time in biophilia</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.320" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">i just went camping again uh this</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.799" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">weekend</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:46.799" style="s2">uh i haven&#39;t done it for a while and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">parks are finally open</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.799" end="00:33:49.519" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got all the social</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:50.000" style="s2">distancing in place it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.519" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">place i</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.000" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">used to go as a child so it was a a deep</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:54.880" style="s2">sort of uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">almost homecoming and the people where i</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">with or i was</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:59.600" style="s2">you know most of the beloved people in</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">my life</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.600" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">um and so uh but but again just being</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">and there were that sense of how readily</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">it affords</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:12.480" style="s2">anorexia i recommend practicing that a</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.480" end="00:34:18.320" style="s2">and then gradually trying to bring it in</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">as you said made into the soulless</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.320" end="00:34:24.879" style="s2">technological environment</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">i recommend if this takes some deeper</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.879" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">conceptual cognitive work</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">because because we&#39;re natural-born</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:35.200" style="s2">cyborgs the technology isn&#39;t just out</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">there as a tool</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.200" end="00:34:40.159" style="s2">it permeates on mostly unconsciously it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">permeates our very sense of self</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.159" end="00:34:43.679" style="s2">and our way of sizing up the world and</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.679" end="00:34:49.119" style="s2">some of the work coming out of heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.200" end="00:34:50.320" style="s2">uh on you know the question concerning</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:53.720" style="s2">technology and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.320" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">ways of the way in which uh technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.720" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">insinuates an insidious metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">technology isn&#39;t evil that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:02.320" style="s2">i&#39;m talking about i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">the way in which it&#39;s culturally</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.320" end="00:35:06.640" style="s2">situated and it it</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.760" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of an insidious right it right</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.640" end="00:35:10.000" style="s2">it insinuates</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.760" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">and insidious metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.000" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">existential modes</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.359" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">uh into our thinking and so learning a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">bit more about that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">and then as a preparation and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">once you&#39;ve got sort of that revision of</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">your cultural cognitive grammar</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:26.800" style="s2">try to bring the savoring out of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:30.560" style="s2">more natural biophilic environments</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.800" end="00:35:31.920" style="s2">into ones that are more technologically</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.560" end="00:35:35.920" style="s2">encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.920" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">that would be my recommendation another</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.920" end="00:35:40.640" style="s2">observation from mark welcome again i</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:42.320" style="s2">was outside taking pictures of my flower</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.640" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">yesterday i was savoring the outside the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.320" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">smells and sounds it worked quite well</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">yes even a short walk lovely thank you</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">for this practice</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:51.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s again so the contrast that so</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">mark has</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.440" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">been very exemplary here the contrast</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">between doing it in his room</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">and doing it in a more natural</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:00.320" style="s2">environment is bringing out the point</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:36:01.440" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s why i&#39;ve given the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.359" style="s2">recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.440" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">and like i said just simply shifting the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.359" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">practice from nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:07.680" style="s2">into the technological environment that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.000" style="s2">that will work</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.680" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">probably but you can really ramp it up</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.000" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">if you read some of the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">that is reflecting on the way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:24.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t just things around us</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">it gets insinuated a a world view</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.000" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">an existential mode gets insinuated into</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.960" style="s2">the very fabric</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">um and texture of our being uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.960" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">of our of our self</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:42.480" style="s2">so taco and soho observation i feel calm</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">that&#39;s good so</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.480" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">here&#39;s where the epicureanism and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:49.280" style="s2">and the buddhist stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:52.560" style="s2">really uh can be helpful to us</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.280" end="00:36:55.119" style="s2">remember if it&#39;s the calm of escapism</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.560" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s the contentedness of a cabbage</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.119" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not what&#39;s after here but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">anorexia if it&#39;s the joy of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.000" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s the if it&#39;s the mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">if it&#39;s the participation in that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.800" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">of being itself that active uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.800" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">calm the calm that is the perpetual</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">affordance of insight then</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">that is the calm we&#39;re after matthew</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">mccready</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">observation i generally think in words</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">and lesson images but during this course</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">i definitely feel my imaginative skills</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">develop as i can imagine my inner world</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">that is um that is widely reported that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:42.560" style="s2">meditative practices</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">open up the inner senses um that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.560" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">they reported i also</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">noted that it&#39;s reported um that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:52.079" style="s2">people&#39;s experience becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">synesthetic um</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.079" end="00:37:55.119" style="s2">synthetic becomes more symptomatic uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:57.520" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.119" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">there&#39;s more secret uh synchronicities</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.520" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">uh so all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">tend to increase the whole imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">realm</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">as opposed to the merely imaginary the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:08.800" style="s2">whole imaginal realm</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">uh opens up quite profoundly um</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.800" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">with the these extended practices this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">ecology practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">uh so thank you for sharing that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">that is something to savor um</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:22.160" style="s2">it really is it&#39;s a way of coming alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:25.599" style="s2">that your inner life</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.160" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">comes alive as you start to get a felt</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.599" end="00:38:31.760" style="s2">sense of what it is to move beyond um</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:34.880" style="s2">the prop the the merely propositional</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.760" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">into the procedural and the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.880" end="00:38:37.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what the imagery is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">then when it&#39;s transforming your</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.599" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">that&#39;s ultimately the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:50.560" style="s2">so our last uh question uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">taquin soho i was wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.560" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">spiritual materialism would love to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">more about the subject so there&#39;s a book</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">written by trungpa</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:59.440" style="s2">called spiritual materialism uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:01.040" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.440" end="00:39:02.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember there&#39;s a book but</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.040" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">there&#39;s articles within</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.800" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">uh psycho psychotherapeutic uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">research called spiritual bypassing so</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">pick up the book by trungpa called</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">spiritual materialism</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:18.720" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s called cutting through</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:19.119" style="s2">spiritual materialism um and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.720" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.119" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">i recommend that that that&#39;s that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s considered a classic</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:27.359" style="s2">uh uh but i also recommend taking a look</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.599" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">within the psychotherapeutic</p>
