<p begin="00:07:11.780" end="00:07:16.669" style="s2">until that study group between the</p>

<p begin="00:07:16.669" end="00:07:23.960" style="s2">so I remember reading one time where a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.410" end="00:07:26.750" style="s2">New Republic I think it was Joe early</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.960" end="00:07:31.610" style="s2">critique Murray on his concept of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.750" end="00:07:34.610" style="s2">elegance because he he defined it early</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.610" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">that is as kind of an effete kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.610" end="00:07:42.290" style="s2">thing to him right I brought that up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:45.889" style="s2">Murray he says man these guys need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.290" end="00:07:47.660" style="s2">get an education he says we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.889" end="00:07:51.650" style="s2">talking about elegance I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.660" end="00:07:54.110" style="s2">like mathematical elegance like you come</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.650" end="00:07:55.780" style="s2">up with the proof that is so elegant for</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.110" end="00:07:58.130" style="s2">something that&#39;s complicated or complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.780" end="00:08:01.250" style="s2">but you come up with a solution that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.130" end="00:08:04.310" style="s2">simple but that incorporates all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.250" end="00:08:05.410" style="s2">complexity and solves the problem in an</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.310" end="00:08:09.710" style="s2">elegant way</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.410" end="00:08:11.630" style="s2">so for Murray the blues and jazz were</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.710" end="00:08:12.979" style="s2">ways in there are other aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.630" end="00:08:16.039" style="s2">african-american culture that we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.979" end="00:08:19.700" style="s2">talk about from the dance traditions to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.039" end="00:08:21.169" style="s2">the spirituals and gospel that also</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.700" end="00:08:23.900" style="s2">reflect us but if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.169" end="00:08:26.740" style="s2">music blues and jazz it was a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.900" end="00:08:30.200" style="s2">we responded to the vicissitudes of life</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.740" end="00:08:37.240" style="s2">to the absurdity of life to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.200" end="00:08:41.300" style="s2">unfairness of life to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.240" end="00:08:45.110" style="s2">segregation and oppression all of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.300" end="00:08:48.380" style="s2">stuff we responded in a way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.110" end="00:08:51.830" style="s2">created forms that allowed us to put our</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.380" end="00:08:56.209" style="s2">wisdom into those forms to confront</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.830" end="00:08:58.130" style="s2">life in a way that allowed us to have</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.209" end="00:09:01.010" style="s2">what Kenneth Burke calls a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.130" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">acceptance in literary terms there</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.010" end="00:09:07.900" style="s2">according to Kenneth Burke two primary</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:11.560" style="s2">frames you have a frame of rejection</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.900" end="00:09:14.620" style="s2">frame of acceptance so a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.560" end="00:09:17.740" style="s2">rejection is like a lament and elegy</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.620" end="00:09:21.160" style="s2">life is wrong and it shouldn&#39;t be that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.740" end="00:09:23.530" style="s2">way and you create different narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.160" end="00:09:26.290" style="s2">forms through that the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.530" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">acceptance accepts the fact that life is</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.290" end="00:09:31.930" style="s2">a low-down dirty shame and said you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:34.210" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna persevere we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.930" end="00:09:36.850" style="s2">gonna struggle we&#39;re gonna rise to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.210" end="00:09:39.640" style="s2">occasion anyway so that&#39;s a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.850" end="00:09:42.580" style="s2">accepting the necessity for struggle and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.640" end="00:09:43.840" style="s2">to Marie that&#39;s the foundation of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.580" end="00:09:47.140" style="s2">epic heroism</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.840" end="00:09:51.190" style="s2">so for Marie the blues and jazz for</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.140" end="00:09:55.480" style="s2">forms that reflected American principles</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.190" end="00:09:57.550" style="s2">of democracy in action and reflected an</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.480" end="00:10:00.820" style="s2">orientation to life that says that no</p>

<p begin="00:10:00.820" end="00:10:07.840" style="s2">many bars as we&#39;ve got swing as much as</p>

<p begin="00:10:15.520" end="00:10:21.790" style="s2">as there&#39;s that resilience there so it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.430" end="00:10:25.270" style="s2">gives us a way to bounce back from the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.790" end="00:10:26.710" style="s2">troubles of our lives okay and he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.270" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">use this term because I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.710" end="00:10:34.030" style="s2">Nassim Taleb had created yeah but anti</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:36.460" style="s2">fragile see so I think he would probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.030" end="00:10:38.890" style="s2">I mean I think elegant resilience is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.460" end="00:10:41.950" style="s2">actually more elegant than elegant</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.890" end="00:10:44.200" style="s2">antifragility as a sound as a poetic</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.950" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">sound but that&#39;s kind of what he needs</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.200" end="00:10:49.300" style="s2">you know I hope I answered your question</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:53.050" style="s2">I kind of went around to get to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.300" end="00:10:54.970" style="s2">yeah totally and III this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.050" end="00:10:56.980" style="s2">intersection of stoicism in like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.970" end="00:11:00.460" style="s2">know the blues jazz idiom just totally</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.980" end="00:11:02.230" style="s2">collide is this kind of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.460" end="00:11:04.210" style="s2">talking about before like the obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.230" end="00:11:05.860" style="s2">the way right with this frame of</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.210" end="00:11:07.840" style="s2">acceptance rather than having to stick</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.860" end="00:11:11.380" style="s2">the mindset where you&#39;re just not kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.840" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">of acknowledging and embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.380" end="00:11:18.310" style="s2">hardship of life and I just like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:20.500" style="s2">this elegance elegant resilience isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.310" end="00:11:21.730" style="s2">that that that kind of a tag of elegance</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.500" end="00:11:24.040" style="s2">there you know that&#39;s that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.730" end="00:11:25.060" style="s2">I think modern stoicism is missing or at</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.040" end="00:11:28.630" style="s2">least a lot of people who talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.060" end="00:11:32.470" style="s2">modern stoicism because there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.630" end="00:11:33.850" style="s2">beauty to be found in the resilience in</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.470" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">the struggle and putting emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.850" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">that I think is the right move and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:40.899" style="s2">there&#39;s another quote like this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:44.139" style="s2">coming to mind I just like he came out a</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.899" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">book by Ralph Ellison the Blues is an</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.139" end="00:11:49.420" style="s2">impulse to keep the painful details and</p>

<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:12:02.410" style="s2">quote is a classic quote can you keep</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.089" end="00:12:04.329" style="s2">going on that yeah okay so uh okay I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.410" end="00:12:06.699" style="s2">start again the Blues is an impulse to</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.889" end="00:12:25.540" style="s2">comic lyricism</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.070" end="00:12:31.540" style="s2">that&#39;s classic Ellison they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.540" end="00:12:34.779" style="s2">Richard rice Blue&#39;s 1947 yeah all right</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.779" end="00:12:42.389" style="s2">you another aspect Murray and Ellison</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.170" end="00:12:46.600" style="s2">both like the term antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.389" end="00:12:49.540" style="s2">cooperation this is a term that derives</p>

<p begin="00:12:49.540" end="00:12:59.589" style="s2">archetype and it basically says that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.089" end="00:13:02.319" style="s2">hero will have to face challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.589" end="00:13:05.410" style="s2">with each of us in our own way as we</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.029" end="00:13:16.329" style="s2">we gonna face it with a frame of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.529" end="00:13:19.240" style="s2">acceptance so we&#39;re going to face it</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.329" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">with the frame of rejection if you face</p>

<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:14:00.490" style="s2">corporation they don&#39;t seem to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.940" end="00:14:03.070" style="s2">together and there&#39;s a tension there but</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.070" end="00:14:07.810" style="s2">happen through tension and when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.290" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">about music you have tension and then</p>

<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:16.870" style="s2">concepts go together so antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:20.260" style="s2">cooperation was a very important idea</p>

<p begin="00:15:04.720" end="00:15:11.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s embedded in the very structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.170" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">of what we do and we demonstrate it like</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.110" end="00:15:16.740" style="s2">like for example for antagonistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:20.680" style="s2">cooperation we usually show a video of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.740" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">Wynton Marsalis and Jon Faddis two of</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.190" style="s2">it&#39;s like on the metronome</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.579" end="00:15:39.579" style="s2">is like I don&#39;t know 300 beats per</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.190" end="00:15:42.850" style="s2">minute I mean it&#39;s ridiculous and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.579" end="00:15:45.250" style="s2">are trading fours and they are battling</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.850" end="00:15:47.769" style="s2">but they&#39;re doing it in a respectful way</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.250" end="00:15:49.390" style="s2">they&#39;re listening they&#39;re responding and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.769" end="00:15:50.860" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.390" end="00:15:53.770" style="s2">take each other to higher and higher</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.860" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">heights so it can be viewed from the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.770" end="00:15:59.860" style="s2">outsiders antagonistic but they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.860" end="00:16:04.960" style="s2">bring pleasure to themselves and to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.500" end="00:16:07.450" style="s2">audience and the other band members so</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.960" end="00:16:11.380" style="s2">we give those kind of examples and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.450" end="00:16:14.620" style="s2">we for the antagonist cooperation we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.380" end="00:16:16.290" style="s2">look at challenges that people have gone</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.620" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">through in their life where at work and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.290" end="00:16:23.140" style="s2">then we help them do a shift from like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:25.390" style="s2">victim perspective oh so and so from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.140" end="00:16:29.440" style="s2">outside is their fault and blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.390" end="00:16:32.050" style="s2">blah - more of a player you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.440" end="00:16:33.490" style="s2">a player in this game this infinite game</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.050" end="00:16:35.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t get that deep into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.490" end="00:16:37.870" style="s2">philosophy but we are applying the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.050" end="00:16:39.640" style="s2">philosophy and we do a shift from how do</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.870" end="00:16:42.130" style="s2">you look at your challenges as something</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.640" end="00:16:44.410" style="s2">that&#39;s against you as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.130" end="00:16:47.590" style="s2">actually for you to grow and learn and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.410" end="00:16:49.210" style="s2">use actual examples in their lives to</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.590" end="00:16:52.120" style="s2">reflect that principle they write about</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.210" end="00:16:54.640" style="s2">it they talk about it in dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.120" end="00:16:58.210" style="s2">that&#39;s how we kind of embody and enacted</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.640" end="00:17:01.030" style="s2">in that so that&#39;s one example I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.210" end="00:17:02.890" style="s2">be doing some more classes on cultural</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.030" end="00:17:05.440" style="s2">intelligence and that type of thing in</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.890" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">the fall that&#39;ll have a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.440" end="00:17:11.500" style="s2">principles also what is the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">with fur for people who don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.500" end="00:17:14.320" style="s2">between blues and jazz I&#39;m so glad you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.900" end="00:17:16.900" style="s2">asked that</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.320" end="00:17:19.810" style="s2">okay so blues is the fundamental form</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.900" end="00:17:25.150" style="s2">that actually is a foundation for</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.810" end="00:17:28.120" style="s2">American music writ large blues is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.150" end="00:17:30.970" style="s2">form that in the American South on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.120" end="00:17:36.580" style="s2">Mississippi River developed first you</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.970" end="00:17:41.320" style="s2">have the folk blues where the the image</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.580" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">of the the guitar player who is playing</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.320" end="00:17:46.630" style="s2">the guitar and singing the blues like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:48.520" style="s2">12 bar blues or playing harmonica and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.630" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2">then singing the blues so you have the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.520" end="00:17:54.390" style="s2">individual there when you get and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:58.300" style="s2">like turn-of-the-century right</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.390" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">WC handy was a great writer of songs</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.300" end="00:18:04.890" style="s2">like st. Louis Blues Memphis blues</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.020" end="00:18:07.140" style="s2">he codified the blues and wrote many</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.890" end="00:18:09.300" style="s2">songs to really write down a tradition</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.140" end="00:18:10.890" style="s2">what in many cases it wasn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.300" end="00:18:13.350" style="s2">written now and these were itinerant</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.890" end="00:18:16.920" style="s2">musician so disliked their old song and</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.350" end="00:18:19.200" style="s2">dance men and women and back in the day</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.920" end="00:18:21.000" style="s2">in Europe this is a similar thing so</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.200" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">they would travel on the railroad and go</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.000" end="00:18:26.790" style="s2">from place to place and play and get a</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:29.700" style="s2">little money in but WC hand is important</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.790" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">in that then you have in the 20s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.700" end="00:18:36.230" style="s2">period that&#39;s called the classic blues</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">this is where women like Ma Rainey</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.230" end="00:18:47.250" style="s2">Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith and others</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:49.710" style="s2">they sang with a band and they were big</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.250" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">sellers and what they call race records</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.710" end="00:18:55.460" style="s2">at the time big sellers of the blues so</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:18:58.230" style="s2">that was a transition from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.460" end="00:19:01.890" style="s2">individual to more of a group dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.230" end="00:19:07.380" style="s2">and the distinction between blues</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.890" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">Wizards use a 12-bar form with 1 4 &amp; 5</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.380" end="00:19:15.510" style="s2">of the eighth notes or the eighth doremi</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:20.790" style="s2">fossil at Edo scale being prominent in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.510" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">those with jazz you and I&#39;ll use a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.790" end="00:19:28.220" style="s2">Murray term you extend elaborate and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">refine upon that folk foundation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.220" end="00:19:32.790" style="s2">then you create forms that go into more</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:37.320" style="s2">of a popular which is more of a wider</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.790" end="00:19:42.500" style="s2">span of embrace to fine art where if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.320" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">listen to Lead Belly my muddy</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.500" end="00:19:47.880" style="s2">what&#39;s-his-name any warriors or any</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">number of really even be became great</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.880" end="00:19:54.300" style="s2">blues artists you listen to Charlie</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">Parker played the Blues you listen to</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.300" end="00:19:58.679" style="s2">Duke Ellington compose what Murray</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:20:01.860" style="s2">called the fully orchestrated blue</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.679" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">statement and you can tell that there is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.860" end="00:20:10.080" style="s2">a level of of sophistication and</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">technical prowess that is beyond what</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.080" end="00:20:14.250" style="s2">you usually find at the folk level so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:17.030" style="s2">what you got</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.250" end="00:20:19.710" style="s2">foundation of the blues that then jazz</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.030" end="00:20:22.830" style="s2">builds upon and actually gospel music</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.710" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">which was the father of gospel music is</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.830" end="00:20:31.380" style="s2">Thomas Dorsey he actually was a blues</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">pianist playing with Ma Rainey and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.380" end="00:20:36.090" style="s2">he transitioned to the sacred dimension</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:39.110" style="s2">and started writing gospel music which</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.090" end="00:20:41.660" style="s2">was actually based on the Blues for I</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.110" end="00:20:46.350" style="s2">hope that answers a question adequately</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.660" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">yeah in this article you sent there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.350" end="00:20:50.660" style="s2">like the three distinctions between the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:53.430" style="s2">folk art pop fare and then fine art and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.660" end="00:20:54.900" style="s2">like could you tease out a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.430" end="00:20:56.820" style="s2">more like you know pop Ferrer versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.900" end="00:20:58.890" style="s2">fine art like what makes it what are the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.820" end="00:21:00.360" style="s2">heuristics that make it what it is okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.890" end="00:21:01.950" style="s2">good question I don&#39;t appreciate it I</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:03.810" style="s2">like what you frame that too</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.950" end="00:21:06.450" style="s2">well I gave you the folk you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.810" end="00:21:09.930" style="s2">like that&#39;s like the earth but then for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.450" end="00:21:13.380" style="s2">pop music what pop music and look pop</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.930" end="00:21:14.520" style="s2">music has taken over the world these</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.380" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2">days okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.520" end="00:21:25.470" style="s2">so pop music actually draws upon folk</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.580" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">fine whatever and it presents the music</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.470" end="00:21:32.520" style="s2">in a way that is most widely appealing</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:35.220" style="s2">okay through how it does what it does</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.520" end="00:21:36.750" style="s2">rhythmically melodically of course we</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.220" end="00:21:40.200" style="s2">know in terms of corporations there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.750" end="00:21:44.940" style="s2">huge mark marketing dollars that go into</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.200" end="00:21:48.570" style="s2">making certain stars stars but pop just</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.940" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">means it has a very wide appeal fine art</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.570" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">is the realm of masterpieces of masters</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:58.380" style="s2">grand masters who create masterpieces</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:22:01.740" style="s2">that stand the test of time beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.380" end="00:22:06.030" style="s2">time that it was created and does so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.740" end="00:22:08.580" style="s2">a way where they stomp the blues</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.030" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">continually throughout time because they</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.580" end="00:22:13.680" style="s2">are facing entropy and chaos itself and</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">saying you know something we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.680" end="00:22:19.320" style="s2">bring some Nega and repeat to this with</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:24.510" style="s2">a masterpiece I can let you hear certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.320" end="00:22:27.720" style="s2">solos that were 60 70 years ago but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.510" end="00:22:30.870" style="s2">power the majesty</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.720" end="00:22:35.130" style="s2">the the the combination of technical</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.870" end="00:22:38.039" style="s2">virtuosity with deep soulful feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.130" end="00:22:41.070" style="s2">so profound that it just becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.039" end="00:22:42.870" style="s2">masterpiece so those are some of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.070" end="00:22:45.809" style="s2">distinctions you know and there are some</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.870" end="00:22:48.830" style="s2">pop art that becomes fine art don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.809" end="00:22:54.120" style="s2">me wrong I listen to Whitney Houston</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.830" end="00:22:56.669" style="s2">singing the star-spangled banner it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.120" end="00:22:57.480" style="s2">gives me chills every time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.669" end="00:23:00.929" style="s2">incredible</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.480" end="00:23:04.340" style="s2">that&#39;s fine art Donny Hathaway singing</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.610" end="00:24:08.159" style="s2">in terms of like spiral dynamics like</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.110" end="00:24:48.330" style="s2">far as jazz sometimes you just need an</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.300" end="00:24:51.870" style="s2">introduction because jazz is not really</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.330" end="00:24:54.990" style="s2">heard and on radio stations not much on</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.410" end="00:26:04.980" style="s2">feel it and sense it but usually it</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.000" end="00:26:06.660" style="s2">takes some grounding and some and some</p>

<p begin="00:27:02.880" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">Rudy cosmopolitanism is a term that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.880" end="00:27:11.880" style="s2">comes from the philosopher Anthony</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.059" end="00:27:33.720" style="s2">the idea of an unrooted cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.529" end="00:27:34.909" style="s2">someone who excuse me is a citizen of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.720" end="00:27:39.710" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.909" end="00:27:42.149" style="s2">no moorings no foundation no roots and</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.710" end="00:27:44.010" style="s2">and frankly in the history of the term</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.149" end="00:27:48.270" style="s2">they were usually speaking about Jewish</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.010" end="00:27:51.899" style="s2">folks when they said that so he coined</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.270" end="00:27:55.080" style="s2">this rooted cosmopolitanism as a way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.899" end="00:27:59.029" style="s2">looking at just the reality that you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.080" end="00:28:05.730" style="s2">be rooted in a tradition in a place in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.029" end="00:28:07.740" style="s2">tradition ethnically culturally but you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.730" end="00:28:10.380" style="s2">can still be cosmopolitan at the same</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.740" end="00:28:14.130" style="s2">time you can still be world centric and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.380" end="00:28:16.470" style="s2">cosmos centric you can still be both it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.130" end="00:28:21.299" style="s2">to me it just makes so much sense so if</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.470" end="00:28:23.789" style="s2">you put it in spiral dynamics terms you</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.299" end="00:28:27.059" style="s2">can say first tier is kind of the rooted</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.789" end="00:28:29.159" style="s2">part you know and you can say second</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.059" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">tier is the cosmopolitan part now of</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.159" end="00:28:36.750" style="s2">course I&#39;m what would be the term I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:42.630" style="s2">privileged in the cosmopolitan on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.750" end="00:28:47.210" style="s2">higher level but I think it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.630" end="00:28:57.539" style="s2">term to get away from some of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.210" end="00:29:00.450" style="s2">potholes and trapdoors of race talk and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.539" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">race discourse so we could talk about</p>

<p begin="00:29:07.140" end="00:29:14.940" style="s2">rooted and grounded in and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.360" end="00:29:18.030" style="s2">time you can relate on larger spheres of</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.940" end="00:29:20.910" style="s2">care and concern and identification you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.030" end="00:29:24.360" style="s2">know Danielle Allen who&#39;s at Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.910" end="00:29:26.549" style="s2">who&#39;s she&#39;s got two phd&#39;s I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.360" end="00:29:29.160" style="s2">like she&#39;s the ridiculous level of</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.500" end="00:29:38.600" style="s2">and she also adopts the term rooted</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:41.460" style="s2">cosmopolitanism in certain context so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.600" end="00:29:44.549" style="s2">yeah I I think that&#39;s the term that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.460" end="00:29:46.830" style="s2">think people can use I mean I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.549" end="00:29:49.350" style="s2">it to the integral community through</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.830" end="00:29:51.179" style="s2">integral life and for some reason I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.350" end="00:29:53.309" style="s2">maybe I was wrong messenger people</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.179" end="00:29:55.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to gravity at least maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.309" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">they didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t didn&#39;t tell me but</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.620" end="00:30:00.210" style="s2">it seems to me it just so well describes</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:03.150" style="s2">like it&#39;s the integral concept in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.210" end="00:30:05.429" style="s2">you could be rooted but you could also</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.150" end="00:30:07.020" style="s2">be cosmopolitan at the same time because</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.429" end="00:30:09.780" style="s2">if you&#39;re supposed to transcend and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.020" end="00:30:12.419" style="s2">include all of that shouldn&#39;t you be</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.780" end="00:30:15.690" style="s2">rooted but as well as cosmopolitan I</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.419" end="00:30:19.350" style="s2">mean to me it&#39;s just it just makes a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.690" end="00:30:21.990" style="s2">of sense what do you think Peter yeah I</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.880" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">did you get into stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.100" end="00:31:26.970" style="s2">and what did it trigger in your body not</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:29.970" style="s2">just your mind what did it trigger in</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.970" end="00:31:32.460" style="s2">your body great right I don&#39;t if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.970" end="00:31:34.549" style="s2">hear dogs barking above so opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.460" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">to practice the all of our stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.549" end="00:31:40.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting question why</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:43.470" style="s2">did trigger in my body so I was first</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.470" end="00:31:45.270" style="s2">year university student and I was in</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.470" end="00:31:46.820" style="s2">philosophy and there&#39;s no mention of</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.270" end="00:31:49.710" style="s2">stoicism and philosophy it was only</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.820" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">until a friend gifted me a epictetus his</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.710" end="00:31:54.570" style="s2">handbook that&#39;s my discovered stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:56.159" style="s2">and I just immediately clicked</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.570" end="00:31:59.940" style="s2">he had that that was the exact book</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.159" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">actually that was gifted and it just</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.940" end="00:32:05.520" style="s2">immediately clicked like yes this is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:09.230" style="s2">not only an intuitive level but on an</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.520" end="00:32:11.640" style="s2">intellectual level and I guess it I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.230" end="00:32:13.289" style="s2">don&#39;t know if how I felt largely</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.640" end="00:32:16.440" style="s2">disembody like I didn&#39;t have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.289" end="00:32:18.419" style="s2">somatic practices when I was younger but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.440" end="00:32:20.520" style="s2">it did have a grounding effect you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.419" end="00:32:23.159" style="s2">like it had a firmness they&#39;re like okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.520" end="00:32:25.350" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s harder to shake me</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.159" end="00:32:28.770" style="s2">now when I had these principles kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.350" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">downloaded okay that&#39;s cool that&#39;s cool</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.710" end="00:33:48.690" style="s2">me because I feel that that is one of my</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:55.889" style="s2">roles to mediate this meta crisis we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.690" end="00:34:03.049" style="s2">in I&#39;m 56 years old I have been engaged</p>

<p begin="00:34:22.139" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">feel like kind of being prepared to</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.250" end="00:34:34.099" style="s2">enter the culture wars in a way that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.669" end="00:34:37.980" style="s2">can do some mediation between and among</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.099" end="00:34:46.669" style="s2">some of the factions of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.980" end="00:34:46.669" style="s2">different you know groups of thinkers of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.720" end="00:34:55.379" style="s2">discourse ins if that&#39;s a word because I</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.950" end="00:34:58.970" style="s2">don&#39;t find it happening I find people</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.379" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">that talking past each other their</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.970" end="00:35:03.930" style="s2">flaming each other you know I mean now</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:06.780" style="s2">at the high levels of the of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.930" end="00:35:09.000" style="s2">culture in terms of like the New York</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.780" end="00:35:10.710" style="s2">Times and Wall Street Journal let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.000" end="00:35:14.550" style="s2">about black intellectuals for a second</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.710" end="00:35:19.050" style="s2">there are certain black intellectuals in</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.550" end="00:35:22.380" style="s2">the Wall Street Journal who can flame</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.050" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">other black intellectuals and writers</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.380" end="00:35:26.220" style="s2">and journalists and the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:28.050" style="s2">and vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.220" end="00:35:33.030" style="s2">but why won&#39;t they ever get together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.050" end="00:35:34.470" style="s2">talk why what&#39;s up with that now some</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.030" end="00:35:37.680" style="s2">are willing to do it and that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.470" end="00:35:40.410" style="s2">but I don&#39;t see many or any people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.680" end="00:35:45.280" style="s2">actually bringing them together to have</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.410" end="00:35:49.000" style="s2">a respectful conversation well</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.280" end="00:35:50.830" style="s2">can agree to disagree they can work</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.000" end="00:35:54.850" style="s2">through and wrestle through issues and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.830" end="00:35:57.070" style="s2">go through some agon you know I just</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.850" end="00:35:59.670" style="s2">don&#39;t see it happening it&#39;s ridiculous I</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.070" end="00:36:02.530" style="s2">mean some of this has to do with the way</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.670" end="00:36:06.780" style="s2">social media structure and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.530" end="00:36:11.230" style="s2">mainstream media is structured so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.780" end="00:36:13.870" style="s2">the polarities and the dichotomies are</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.230" end="00:36:17.050" style="s2">something that triggers our amygdalas</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.870" end="00:36:18.940" style="s2">and our you know fear response</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.050" end="00:36:21.640" style="s2">flight-or-fight and all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.940" end="00:36:25.110" style="s2">they&#39;re able to get viewership clicks</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.640" end="00:36:30.010" style="s2">that&#39;s why for decades I haven&#39;t watched</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.110" end="00:36:34.510" style="s2">local news in the evening they always</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.010" end="00:36:39.070" style="s2">start with some type of tragic horrific</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.510" end="00:36:41.320" style="s2">crime and I knew what they were doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:44.230" style="s2">when I was like a teenager I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.320" end="00:36:46.450" style="s2">they&#39;re doing this on purpose to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.230" end="00:36:50.020" style="s2">trigger you you know and I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.450" end="00:36:52.360" style="s2">fall into that so the structures are set</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.020" end="00:36:55.210" style="s2">up for that and we have to find some</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.360" end="00:36:58.420" style="s2">ways and it&#39;ll take some courage and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.210" end="00:37:00.490" style="s2">sure I&#39;m gonna get my knocks but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.420" end="00:37:03.610" style="s2">ready for it I think I&#39;ve been prepared</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.490" end="00:37:08.620" style="s2">for it so in terms of how I deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.610" end="00:37:12.280" style="s2">I stay centered in myself with through</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.620" end="00:37:14.860" style="s2">my own practices I meditate I have a</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:33.370" style="s2">that I can&#39;t hold in these perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.120" end="00:37:36.580" style="s2">and his knowledge and not bring it to</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.370" end="00:37:39.970" style="s2">the fore that I have a responsibility to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.580" end="00:37:42.160" style="s2">step up because the need is so great you</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.970" end="00:37:45.310" style="s2">know so I&#39;m willing to take the risks</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.310" end="00:37:52.120" style="s2">facilitation and mimetic mediation you</p>

<p begin="00:40:23.200" end="00:40:27.700" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one that I would strongly</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.390" end="00:40:32.280" style="s2">recommend it may be I was called to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.700" end="00:40:35.050" style="s2">that for you thank you you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.280" end="00:40:37.080" style="s2">and the other Andrew had a question as</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.050" end="00:40:37.080" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.300" end="00:40:45.310" style="s2">thank you Greg I&#39;m a big fan of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.460" end="00:40:46.930" style="s2">blues I like listening to a different a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.310" end="00:40:49.060" style="s2">lot of different kind of music but</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.930" end="00:40:50.369" style="s2">there&#39;s something about the blues and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.060" end="00:40:53.710" style="s2">sort of like the visceral connection</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.369" end="00:40:55.150" style="s2">that it brings to me that it&#39;s really it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.710" end="00:40:57.369" style="s2">really draws me towards that like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.150" end="00:40:59.770" style="s2">been playing guitar for a while and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.369" end="00:41:01.840" style="s2">mentioned BB King and like those bends</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.770" end="00:41:03.520" style="s2">so that BB King does like it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.840" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">most complicated stuff but it just</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.520" end="00:41:09.820" style="s2">really brings out like a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:12.550" style="s2">emotion and it&#39;s really great so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.820" end="00:41:14.410" style="s2">question I had is can you genuinely play</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.550" end="00:41:19.869" style="s2">the Blues if you haven&#39;t faced adversity</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.410" end="00:41:23.050" style="s2">or struggle in your life the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.869" end="00:41:27.900" style="s2">well first of all do you know anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.050" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">hasn&#39;t faced some struggle in their life</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.900" end="00:41:34.330" style="s2">okay so you know that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:36.910" style="s2">universal and look you could have all</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.330" end="00:41:40.330" style="s2">the money in the world you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.910" end="00:41:42.609" style="s2">mean and not be happy</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.330" end="00:41:45.760" style="s2">so first so that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.609" end="00:41:48.280" style="s2">about the Blues it&#39;s about you know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.760" end="00:41:52.630" style="s2">Buddhist you know life is suffering you</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.280" end="00:41:56.859" style="s2">know so that that&#39;s that&#39;s intrinsic to</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.630" end="00:41:59.650" style="s2">it but to answer your question from a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.859" end="00:42:03.480" style="s2">musical and technical perspective yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.650" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">you can play you don&#39;t have to and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.480" end="00:42:09.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a book I&#39;m going to recommend to</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">you and and this may seem a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.240" end="00:42:20.650" style="s2">self-serving because I am one of the I</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">want to show you this okay here it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.650" end="00:42:22.980" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.010" end="00:42:29.600" style="s2">talks music Albert Murray on jazz and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.140" end="00:42:33.650" style="s2">blues and you see this guy right here</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.600" end="00:42:35.060" style="s2">wrote the afterwards Greg Thomas so the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.650" end="00:42:37.490" style="s2">reason I recommend this book in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.060" end="00:42:42.530" style="s2">context is because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.490" end="00:42:45.470" style="s2">conversation in here between Wynton</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.530" end="00:42:47.480" style="s2">Marsalis and Albert Murray when Albert</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.470" end="00:42:50.060" style="s2">Murray was Winton&#39;s intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.480" end="00:42:51.560" style="s2">grandfather and mentor he was my mentor</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.060" end="00:42:54.020" style="s2">I mean I actually knew him was mentored</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.560" end="00:42:56.180" style="s2">by him and they talked about that very</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.020" end="00:42:59.270" style="s2">issue so when you&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.180" end="00:43:02.090" style="s2">musical form you learn the musical form</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.270" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">and then you practice and get better at</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.090" end="00:43:10.790" style="s2">that form so there&#39;s a separation</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">between your actual experience and what</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.790" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">you&#39;re playing is a feeling in form</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:22.940" style="s2">that&#39;s Suzanne Langer but you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:25.310" style="s2">to have experienced the heartbreak in</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.940" end="00:43:28.340" style="s2">the specific form that you&#39;re singing</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.310" end="00:43:29.990" style="s2">about you know you can draw upon this so</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.340" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about an art form</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.990" end="00:43:35.510" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about developing a</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:38.350" style="s2">certain technical skill level to then</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.510" end="00:43:42.320" style="s2">play that form yourself and with others</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.350" end="00:43:44.300" style="s2">so yes and no but it&#39;s not a requirement</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.320" end="00:43:47.030" style="s2">in the sense that you meant that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.300" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">why I want to say no you need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.030" end="00:43:52.820" style="s2">the form you know because without</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:55.580" style="s2">knowing the form and the technique your</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.820" end="00:43:58.840" style="s2">ability to express those feelings in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.580" end="00:44:02.360" style="s2">form are going to be limit limited right</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.840" end="00:44:06.050" style="s2">so I hope that answers the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.360" end="00:44:10.050" style="s2">that&#39;s great thank you got</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.050" end="00:44:10.500" style="s2">maybe great you&#39;ve had a question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.050" end="00:44:16.080" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.500" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">oh maybe great okay hi Greg</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.080" end="00:44:21.630" style="s2">my question was about if you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:23.790" style="s2">music opera offers an opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.630" end="00:44:25.830" style="s2">cultures to learn about each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.790" end="00:44:27.240" style="s2">less adversarial context than we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.830" end="00:44:31.650" style="s2">usually offered through things like</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.240" end="00:44:33.780" style="s2">social media what do you think I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.650" end="00:44:35.930" style="s2">definitely imagine that it is but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.780" end="00:44:41.310" style="s2">interested in your viewpoint on it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.930" end="00:44:45.780" style="s2">absolutely absolutely I mean music is</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.310" end="00:44:50.940" style="s2">one of those universals all cultures you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.780" end="00:44:56.310" style="s2">know have music dance so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.940" end="00:44:59.550" style="s2">fundamental to our human experience that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.310" end="00:45:02.970" style="s2">it&#39;s something that can go past some of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.550" end="00:45:06.060" style="s2">the cognitive or much of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.970" end="00:45:10.830" style="s2">and go right into embodiment you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.060" end="00:45:13.320" style="s2">it&#39;s because so you can feel it and not</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.830" end="00:45:17.250" style="s2">just think about it so the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.320" end="00:45:19.410" style="s2">absolutely and it does do that and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.250" end="00:45:20.910" style="s2">want to address something this is not in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.410" end="00:45:24.090" style="s2">your question but this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.910" end="00:45:25.650" style="s2">troubles me so much with certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.090" end="00:45:27.930" style="s2">discourses and I&#39;ll have an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.650" end="00:45:31.940" style="s2">hopefully in some other places when they</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.930" end="00:45:34.770" style="s2">talk about appropriation of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.940" end="00:45:38.870" style="s2">there is such a thing but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.770" end="00:45:42.330" style="s2">overdone that&#39;s the way cultures work</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.870" end="00:45:45.720" style="s2">you see something you like you try it on</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.330" end="00:45:48.750" style="s2">for size you compare it to your own you</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.720" end="00:45:51.270" style="s2">have fun with it you play and you adapt</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.750" end="00:45:54.270" style="s2">it that&#39;s the way culture actually works</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.270" end="00:45:58.230" style="s2">so it&#39;s not about appropriating per se</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.270" end="00:46:02.130" style="s2">it&#39;s about the actual way that culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.230" end="00:46:05.100" style="s2">and acts itself in the world you know to</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.130" end="00:46:08.180" style="s2">me now if you take something claim it as</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.100" end="00:46:10.890" style="s2">your own don&#39;t give it credit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.180" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">appropriation but if you can acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.890" end="00:46:15.510" style="s2">the sources and say this is part of my</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:17.070" style="s2">learning and this is where I got it from</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.510" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">that&#39;s not appropriation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.070" end="00:46:24.710" style="s2">appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:26.759" style="s2">okay Megan you had a similar question</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.710" end="00:46:29.400" style="s2">would you like to meet yourself and ask</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.759" end="00:46:31.619" style="s2">it oh great I think you just answered my</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.400" end="00:46:33.299" style="s2">question already I was asking for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.619" end="00:46:35.190" style="s2">positive direction that you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.299" end="00:46:38.970" style="s2">take this idea of cultural appropriation</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.190" end="00:46:41.099" style="s2">and maybe there&#39;s a there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.970" end="00:46:44.069" style="s2">else you&#39;d like to take that that idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.099" end="00:46:46.380" style="s2">and I&#39;m worried about the D emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.069" end="00:46:49.529" style="s2">personal intention that often comes into</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.380" end="00:46:50.700" style="s2">that story and worse than D emphasis I</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.529" end="00:46:53.099" style="s2">was trying to think of the right word</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.700" end="00:46:55.529" style="s2">there but almost attacking the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.099" end="00:46:57.990" style="s2">intention matters I&#39;m often reading that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.529" end="00:47:02.309" style="s2">and in mainstream media about this idea</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.990" end="00:47:03.450" style="s2">which really worries me I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.309" end="00:47:04.950" style="s2">there&#39;s anything else that you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.450" end="00:47:07.529" style="s2">add to that idea if you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.950" end="00:47:08.940" style="s2">answered that well Megan I want you to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.529" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">tell me a little more about the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.940" end="00:47:12.869" style="s2">connection between intention and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:16.559" style="s2">appropriation I want to get that before</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.869" end="00:47:19.160" style="s2">I respond for me well it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.559" end="00:47:23.039" style="s2">that intention is absolutely critical in</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.160" end="00:47:24.630" style="s2">that question so if you&#39;re absorbing</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.039" end="00:47:28.009" style="s2">something because you like and respect</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.630" end="00:47:30.299" style="s2">it and you&#39;re making changes to it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.009" end="00:47:31.740" style="s2">and creating your own thing based on</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.299" end="00:47:34.349" style="s2">that and that to me seems like a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.740" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">positive thing to do but there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.349" end="00:47:38.789" style="s2">narratives that I&#39;ve read I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:40.200" style="s2">from people that I know that says that</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.789" end="00:47:41.730" style="s2">it actually doesn&#39;t matter whether you</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.200" end="00:47:43.589" style="s2">have good intentions or not what really</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.730" end="00:47:46.829" style="s2">matters is you know what your genetic</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.589" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">heritage is and that to me seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.829" end="00:47:53.789" style="s2">really concerning direction that I see</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:56.849" style="s2">people around me moving in yeah I hear</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.789" end="00:48:01.650" style="s2">you that&#39;s that&#39;s very troubling that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.849" end="00:48:03.809" style="s2">very troubling on so many levels so let</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.650" end="00:48:07.289" style="s2">me just give a little plug here my wife</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.809" end="00:48:10.640" style="s2">and I we have a blog called tune into</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.289" end="00:48:14.519" style="s2">leadership comm and I mention it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.640" end="00:48:16.920" style="s2">she loves to write about creativity</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.519" end="00:48:18.569" style="s2">purpose intention and those types of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.920" end="00:48:20.180" style="s2">things I would invite you all to check</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.569" end="00:48:23.720" style="s2">that out</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.180" end="00:48:28.740" style="s2">intention of course intention matters</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.720" end="00:48:30.869" style="s2">motivation matters I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.740" end="00:48:31.529" style="s2">things about the the discourse on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.869" end="00:48:32.710" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.529" end="00:48:35.380" style="s2">particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.710" end="00:48:38.230" style="s2">or left with a postmodern very</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.380" end="00:48:43.050" style="s2">progressive and political bent is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.230" end="00:48:47.109" style="s2">they they stretch a discourse that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.050" end="00:48:49.930" style="s2">beyond not only logic in many cases but</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.109" end="00:48:53.500" style="s2">so far away from the very traditions</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.930" end="00:48:58.300" style="s2">that they should be looking to for</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.500" end="00:49:00.810" style="s2">wisdom okay you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.300" end="00:49:05.700" style="s2">actually say okay let me give you this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.810" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">when I was in grad school at NYU from</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.700" end="00:49:13.180" style="s2">1996 to 99 that was an American Studies</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:16.359" style="s2">doctoral program at NYU and that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.180" end="00:49:19.630" style="s2">this stuff was really getting going so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.359" end="00:49:22.240" style="s2">studied critical race theory and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.630" end="00:49:26.109" style="s2">critical theory that that was based on I</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.240" end="00:49:29.770" style="s2">studied Foucault and there he died and</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.109" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">others you know and I got something from</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.770" end="00:49:33.490" style="s2">it but I was so grounded in Ellison and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:35.230" style="s2">Murray that I was inoculated from some</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.490" end="00:49:37.480" style="s2">of the extremities from that and I was</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.230" end="00:49:39.869" style="s2">also in my mid-30s so I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.480" end="00:49:42.670" style="s2">wasn&#39;t gonna dis fall down some paths</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.869" end="00:49:48.210" style="s2">but they talked about essentialism back</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.670" end="00:49:50.650" style="s2">then essentialism was the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.210" end="00:49:51.940" style="s2">have bass tones from inherited</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.650" end="00:49:53.830" style="s2">characteristics something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.940" end="00:49:57.580" style="s2">essential to you based on your blood</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.830" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">your genetics and the idea at the time</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.580" end="00:50:02.980" style="s2">is that essentialism wasn&#39;t good</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:08.320" style="s2">seems like essentialism has been thrown</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.980" end="00:50:12.730" style="s2">out the window and adopted as the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.320" end="00:50:17.730" style="s2">fundamental essence of your identity and</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.730" end="00:50:20.380" style="s2">it is it&#39;s so far off base and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.730" end="00:50:21.760" style="s2">there are bubbles of discourse and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.380" end="00:50:24.570" style="s2">just sorta that that that particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.760" end="00:50:27.609" style="s2">bubble of discourse is now getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.570" end="00:50:30.609" style="s2">mainstream distribution but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.609" end="00:50:32.890" style="s2">really critically analyze such terms in</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.609" end="00:50:35.320" style="s2">such ideas because they&#39;re dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.890" end="00:50:38.260" style="s2">where do you find the basis for human</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.320" end="00:50:41.250" style="s2">commonality where do you find the basis</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.260" end="00:50:43.540" style="s2">for you know saying that or</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.250" end="00:50:46.130" style="s2">cosmopolitanism if you use that term I</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.540" end="00:50:49.130" style="s2">mean that idea is so far</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.130" end="00:50:52.549" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna say that because I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.130" end="00:50:56.950" style="s2">a particular genetic heritage therefore</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.549" end="00:50:56.950" style="s2">X Y Z what about your cultural heritage</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.549" end="00:51:03.769" style="s2">biology is the foundation culture comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.759" end="00:51:07.549" style="s2">along to extend our biological</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.769" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">inheritance like a prosthetic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.549" end="00:51:14.839" style="s2">what great anthropologist Paul Bohannon</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:20.299" style="s2">who wrote foundational book me how</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:48.529" style="s2">multi-cultural I am an anti race</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.789" end="00:51:54.049" style="s2">anti-racist so I&#39;m against the concept</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.529" end="00:51:56.920" style="s2">of race so so I don&#39;t like to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.049" end="00:51:59.299" style="s2">multiracial but we could say that too</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.920" end="00:52:03.079" style="s2">how in the world you have all of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.299" end="00:52:05.660" style="s2">mixtures what albamar recall omnia</p>

<p begin="00:52:05.660" end="00:52:11.089" style="s2">mixtures how in the world are you going</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.789" end="00:52:14.599" style="s2">to even scientifically determine some</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.089" end="00:52:18.049" style="s2">type of racial or genetic purity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.599" end="00:52:19.249" style="s2"> most of us are mixed one way or</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.049" end="00:52:21.289" style="s2">the other and if we&#39;re not mixed</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.249" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">biologically with mixed culturally I</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.289" end="00:52:29.599" style="s2">mean it&#39;s ridiculous but we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:32.440" style="s2">patient now we have to have give people</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.599" end="00:52:35.469" style="s2">a chance to voice their opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.440" end="00:52:38.779" style="s2">hopefully through discourse and dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.469" end="00:52:40.910" style="s2">you can help them look at things</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.779" end="00:52:43.400" style="s2">differently or consider some different</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.910" end="00:52:46.609" style="s2">ideas and maybe show them some of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.400" end="00:52:48.589" style="s2">limitations of that train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.609" end="00:52:50.029" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many limitations and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.589" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">so many dead ends to that train of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.029" end="00:52:55.099" style="s2">thought yeah so I don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:57.920" style="s2">answers the appropriation anymore I</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.099" end="00:52:59.470" style="s2">think I kind of did when I anticipated</p>
