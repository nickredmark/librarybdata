<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:26.610" style="s2">at the work of Stanovich and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.110" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">culminating ideas coming out of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.610" end="00:00:32.279" style="s2">rationality debate tried to expel and</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">the notion for you of need for cognition</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.279" end="00:00:35.610" style="s2">talked a little bit more about problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">finding and the generation of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.610" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">Nexus and then also the the affective</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:44.460" style="s2">component of that wonder and curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:47.370" style="s2">and sort of balancing them off together</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.460" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">and then more specifically looked at</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:51.480" style="s2">Stanovich his theory of foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:54.270" style="s2">which he calls disruption Aelia and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.480" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">looked at the idea of dual processing s1</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.270" end="00:01:02.790" style="s2">and s2 and the idea that what makes you</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:05.159" style="s2">foolish is s one&#39;s functioning that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.790" end="00:01:07.530" style="s2">makes you leap to conclusions interferes</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.159" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">with the inferential processing of s2</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.530" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">you leap to conclusions inappropriately</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:15.659" style="s2">and that&#39;s what causes you to be biased</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:18.179" style="s2">in your processing self-deceptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.659" end="00:01:21.179" style="s2">foolish etc and then what active</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.179" end="00:01:23.999" style="s2">open-mindedness does is it for grounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.179" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">s2 and protects it from undue</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.999" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">interference from s1 and that&#39;s all very</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:34.200" style="s2">good in a theoretical context but we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">took a look at work at the work of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.200" end="00:01:41.159" style="s2">jacobs and Teasdale and said but in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:42.439" style="s2">medic sari in a therapeutic context the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.159" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">opposite is the case</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.439" end="00:01:48.599" style="s2">what you need is you need that machinery</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:50.130" style="s2">of leaping to work well and we took a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.599" end="00:01:52.349" style="s2">look at the work of baker senate and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.130" end="00:01:55.159" style="s2">cece showing that that ability to leap</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.349" end="00:01:59.149" style="s2">cognitive leaping is actually very</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.159" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">powerfully predictive of insight and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.149" end="00:02:02.819" style="s2">that&#39;s what you need in therapy you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:04.679" style="s2">insight</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.819" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">powerful kinds of insight to break you</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.679" end="00:02:08.250" style="s2">out of the ways in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:10.709" style="s2">confronting you know existential</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.250" end="00:02:12.980" style="s2">entrapment and inertia ignorance and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.709" end="00:02:18.000" style="s2">cannot infer your way through</p>

<p begin="00:02:18.000" end="00:02:25.540" style="s2">so I proposed and Teasdale also has</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.840" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">independently proposed this that we need</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.540" end="00:02:31.180" style="s2">a cognitive style of that four grams s1</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:33.520" style="s2">puts us into a state for triggering</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.180" end="00:02:35.410" style="s2">insight tends to background and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.520" end="00:02:38.170" style="s2">constrain as to processing that in</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.410" end="00:02:40.330" style="s2">faretta t&#39;v processing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.170" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">mindfulness we know we have evidence</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.330" end="00:02:45.820" style="s2">that mindfulness facilitates insight and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">mindfulness is also increasingly being</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.820" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">incorporated into therapeutic settings</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.990" style="s2">precisely for its capacity to generate</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:55.540" style="s2">cognitive flexibility and afford insight</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.990" end="00:02:59.320" style="s2">so we&#39;re noticing that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.540" end="00:03:00.910" style="s2">needing is right right because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.320" end="00:03:03.370" style="s2">relationship between s 1 and s 2 is</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.910" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">opponent and not adversarial we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.370" end="00:03:06.910" style="s2">to need some higher-order way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.900" end="00:03:09.070" style="s2">coordinating these two cognitive styles</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.910" end="00:03:12.490" style="s2">active open mindedness and mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.070" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">so that we can optimize the enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.490" end="00:03:17.260" style="s2">in rationality of the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:22.150" style="s2">realization that is at the core of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.260" end="00:03:25.680" style="s2">intelligence and then took time before</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.150" end="00:03:27.550" style="s2">we passed to explicit theories</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.680" end="00:03:33.850" style="s2">psychological theories of wisdoms to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.550" end="00:03:36.070" style="s2">note this idea right that how you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.850" end="00:03:37.930" style="s2">relating to your intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.070" end="00:03:40.030" style="s2">applying your intelligence to itself the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.930" end="00:03:42.040" style="s2">degree to which you problematize your</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.030" end="00:03:45.730" style="s2">own intelligence and try and improve it</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.040" end="00:03:47.530" style="s2">we can see that as rationality and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.730" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">I suggested to you I propose to you the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.530" end="00:03:57.460" style="s2">possibility that when I do this when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:04:00.250" style="s2">recursively and reflectively use my</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.460" end="00:04:02.350" style="s2">rationality to enhance and optimize my</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.250" end="00:04:04.390" style="s2">rationality is by enhancing perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.350" end="00:04:06.610" style="s2">relationship between the component</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.390" end="00:04:09.790" style="s2">styles of mindfulness and active open</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.610" end="00:04:12.580" style="s2">mindedness then I&#39;m moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.790" end="00:04:14.050" style="s2">wisdom we took a look at that and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.580" end="00:04:17.560" style="s2">connection with this we took a look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.050" end="00:04:19.239" style="s2">the work of Dweck and again making the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.560" end="00:04:20.890" style="s2">argument that the relay the way you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.239" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">relate to your higher cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.050" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">problem-solving capacity is not just the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.470" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">intellectual or information processing</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:37.290" style="s2">deeply existential and we saw saw the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:39.450" style="s2">work on mine setting and that write the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.290" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">way you identify with your intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.450" end="00:04:44.310" style="s2">the way you&#39;re framing how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:46.889" style="s2">identifying with your intelligence has a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.310" end="00:04:49.110" style="s2">tremendous impact on your need for</p>

<p begin="00:04:50.760" end="00:05:00.780" style="s2">deception self-deception etc okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:05:03.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned a lot along the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.780" end="00:05:06.139" style="s2">think has given us a good framework with</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.630" end="00:05:09.990" style="s2">which we can critically and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.139" end="00:05:14.840" style="s2">constructively engage with some of the I</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.990" end="00:05:21.030" style="s2">think representative theories of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.840" end="00:05:22.889" style="s2">let&#39;s remember earlier on that we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.030" end="00:05:24.300" style="s2">already take a look at a central review</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.889" end="00:05:27.360" style="s2">of some of those theories the work of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.300" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">McGee and Barber showing us that one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:30.210" style="s2">they were not trying to give a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:32.070" style="s2">comprehensive theory of wisdom they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.210" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">just trying to find a central feature</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.070" end="00:05:35.700" style="s2">and the central feature was seeing</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">through a lesion and into reality and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.700" end="00:05:41.789" style="s2">then we took that up as how does one get</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:44.100" style="s2">comprehensively reliably systematically</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.789" end="00:05:45.630" style="s2">better at dealing with self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.100" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">and that&#39;s how we got into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.630" end="00:05:50.010" style="s2">rationality debate that&#39;s how we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.430" end="00:05:53.520" style="s2">so we we&#39;ve done a lot to unpack that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.010" end="00:05:55.380" style="s2">intuition well it&#39;s more than an</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.520" end="00:05:57.539" style="s2">intuition it&#39;s a conclusion of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.380" end="00:05:59.400" style="s2">argument the very careful argument made</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.539" end="00:06:03.000" style="s2">by McGee and barber that at the core of</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.400" end="00:06:05.240" style="s2">wisdom is what I would argue is with</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.000" end="00:06:08.789" style="s2">rationality the systematic and reliable</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.240" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">ability to overcome self-deception now</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.789" end="00:06:13.350" style="s2">let&#39;s take all of this and as I said</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">let&#39;s put it into dialogue with some</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.350" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">existing theories the first theory I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:20.610" style="s2">want to take a look at isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:23.430" style="s2">comprehensive theory of wisdom but</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.610" end="00:06:25.770" style="s2">nevertheless it&#39;s instructive because it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.430" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">brings up some core components of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.770" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">theory of wisdom and it does something</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:32.039" style="s2">that&#39;s exemplary something we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:34.350" style="s2">consider it discusses the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.039" end="00:06:36.539" style="s2">between wisdom and virtue which is an</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.350" end="00:06:39.419" style="s2">idea that&#39;s taken up explicitly by one</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.539" end="00:06:41.250" style="s2">of the core theories of wisdom which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.419" end="00:06:43.320" style="s2">the work of bolts and starting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.250" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">known as the Berlin paradigm but before</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.320" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">we do that in order to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:48.300" style="s2">examine the connection between wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:51.620" style="s2">and virtue I want to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.300" end="00:06:51.620" style="s2">work of Schwartz and Sharpe</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.980" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">and fortune sharp and it&#39;s 2006 is the</p>

<p begin="00:07:39.640" end="00:07:42.730" style="s2">positive psychology is about positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.170" end="00:07:44.440" style="s2">psychology is the idea that we should</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.730" end="00:07:45.640" style="s2">study the mind not only how it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.440" end="00:07:48.100" style="s2">down into its parts</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.640" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">we should also study it in terms of how</p>

<p begin="00:08:10.650" end="00:08:16.710" style="s2">now what Schwartz and sharp are</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.990" end="00:08:20.410" style="s2">interested in is they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.710" end="00:08:22.030" style="s2">some work done by Peterson not Jordan</p>

<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:30.250" style="s2">virtue and they&#39;re discussing virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:34.750" style="s2">course as a form of human excellence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.250" end="00:08:38.530" style="s2">so they study they lists a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.750" end="00:08:43.330" style="s2">virtues and Schwartz and Sharpe sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.530" end="00:08:46.570" style="s2">stand aside from that and they note some</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.330" end="00:08:48.070" style="s2">difficulties with this idea this list of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.570" end="00:08:51.130" style="s2">virtues you know you should be honest</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.070" end="00:08:56.830" style="s2">you should be courageous right things</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.130" end="00:08:59.650" style="s2">like that notice what we have here the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.830" end="00:09:01.570" style="s2">the presentation of the virtues carries</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.650" end="00:09:03.070" style="s2">with it the strong implication that</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:09.850" style="s2">with what we&#39;re given is a feature list</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">of virtues we&#39;re given a feature list of</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.850" end="00:09:14.589" style="s2">virtues without any indicator</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.120" style="s2">of how they relate to each other and see</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.589" end="00:09:17.529" style="s2">in fact there seems to be the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.120" end="00:09:19.269" style="s2">that they&#39;re logically independent from</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.529" end="00:09:22.209" style="s2">each other a very questionable</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.269" end="00:09:23.440" style="s2">assumption right and instead what we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.209" end="00:09:24.850" style="s2">should be looking for is a feature</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.440" end="00:09:28.500" style="s2">schema we should be looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.850" end="00:09:31.750" style="s2">structural functional organization that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.500" end="00:09:38.560" style="s2">helps to explicate and explain how</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.750" end="00:09:41.050" style="s2">virtues relate to each other so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.560" end="00:09:42.519" style="s2">important to note that the feature list</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.050" end="00:09:44.440" style="s2">carries with it the implication that</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.519" end="00:09:46.510" style="s2">what you should simply do is maximize</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.440" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">each virtue and occur and right away</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.510" end="00:09:50.699" style="s2">that tells you an inadequacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:53.740" style="s2">feature list I mean if I maximize</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.699" end="00:09:58.050" style="s2">honesty if I&#39;m always as honest as I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.740" end="00:10:02.529" style="s2">possibly be I will at times be cruel I</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.050" end="00:10:05.170" style="s2">will have given up on kindness right if</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.529" end="00:10:07.480" style="s2">I meet people and say oh I need to tell</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.170" end="00:10:09.399" style="s2">you you&#39;re looking uglier than you did</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.480" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">yesterday I need to tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.399" end="00:10:16.420" style="s2">because it&#39;s being honest maximally</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:18.850" style="s2">honest right we don&#39;t think of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.420" end="00:10:20.560" style="s2">person as being excellent we think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.850" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">that person as being an asshole</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.560" end="00:10:25.630" style="s2">right and so that&#39;s important that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">important right away to notice that</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.630" end="00:10:30.670" style="s2">we&#39;re not trying to maximize the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:33.670" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get some optimal</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.670" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">relationship between them and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.670" end="00:10:38.350" style="s2">ancients had at least these the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:40.060" style="s2">Greeks had a very stronger version of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.350" end="00:10:41.699" style="s2">this they had the idea that the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.060" end="00:10:43.720" style="s2">were actually significantly</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.699" end="00:10:45.310" style="s2">interdependent with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.720" end="00:10:47.290" style="s2">there&#39;s two ways in which they could be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.310" end="00:10:49.390" style="s2">interdependent they could form an</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.290" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">interdependent system or they could all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.390" end="00:10:57.310" style="s2">be different different versions of some</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:59.350" style="s2">core ability I I might come back to that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.310" end="00:11:02.949" style="s2">if I have time but I want to get into</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.350" end="00:11:06.990" style="s2">the core argument so the core argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.949" end="00:11:12.819" style="s2">is right we should talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.990" end="00:11:15.480" style="s2">relationship between the virtues and as</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.819" end="00:11:19.209" style="s2">soon as we do that we can see some</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.480" end="00:11:21.190" style="s2">important issues coming to bear so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.209" end="00:11:23.699" style="s2">they do is they they talk about a couple</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.190" end="00:11:23.699" style="s2">of situations</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.960" end="00:11:30.980" style="s2">in which we can see virtues in conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.080" end="00:11:34.100" style="s2">with each other so one example they give</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.980" end="00:11:35.779" style="s2">is well an example that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.100" end="00:11:39.500" style="s2">something I just said they give the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.779" end="00:11:42.950" style="s2">example of your bridesmaid and right</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.500" end="00:11:46.520" style="s2">time is running out and you&#39;re with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.950" end="00:11:48.260" style="s2">the bride or at least the intended bride</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.520" end="00:11:50.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the metaphysical status before</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.260" end="00:11:51.230" style="s2">the wedding are you bright like your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.120" end="00:11:54.890" style="s2">potential bride I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.230" end="00:11:56.779" style="s2">anyways there with that person and right</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.890" end="00:11:59.270" style="s2">there trying on wedding dresses and time</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.779" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">is running out and right they&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.270" end="00:12:05.060" style="s2">you well how do I look</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:08.420" style="s2">and if you it like so--you you&#39;re caught</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.060" end="00:12:12.500" style="s2">between you know being honest being kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.420" end="00:12:14.690" style="s2">and being helpful right you could just</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">be totally kind it you look wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.690" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">oh it&#39;s beautiful that might not but</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe not the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">right you could be honest you look ugly</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">it&#39;s hideous right that such a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:31.279" style="s2">or you could try to be helpful like we</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:32.930" style="s2">should we&#39;re running out of time um but</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.279" end="00:12:34.400" style="s2">then what do you say and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.930" end="00:12:36.980" style="s2">balance them all do you just give up</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.400" end="00:12:39.890" style="s2">honesty&#39;s you just lie no do you give up</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.980" end="00:12:41.390" style="s2">Cana Ste kindness you just brutal no do</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.890" end="00:12:42.860" style="s2">you forget that you&#39;re trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:48.850" style="s2">helpful and you&#39;re undercut time</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.860" end="00:12:51.709" style="s2">constraints no what do you do all right</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.850" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">the another example they give is right</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.709" end="00:12:54.050" style="s2">there&#39;s the one that&#39;s put into me</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:59.300" style="s2">you&#39;re grading an assignment for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.050" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">student right now this is the student</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.300" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">has you know they they&#39;ve made terrific</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:10.070" style="s2">progress they&#39;ve really overcome some</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:12.529" style="s2">barriers they&#39;ve gone from like you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.070" end="00:13:16.670" style="s2">a low C and they&#39;ve been improving and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.529" end="00:13:19.820" style="s2">they&#39;re getting into a high B now if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.670" end="00:13:22.640" style="s2">grade this if I try to grade this paper</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.820" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">as completely objectively as I possibly</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.640" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:28.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that that feedback</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">will stop that arc will stop that growth</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.579" end="00:13:32.600" style="s2">and the person will remain a B student</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.760" style="s2">but if I if I just give them a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.600" end="00:13:36.080" style="s2">bit of encouragement if I if I extend it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.760" end="00:13:38.390" style="s2">and is this</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.080" end="00:13:39.710" style="s2">lying because what I&#39;m what am I doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.390" end="00:13:42.170" style="s2">with marking am i marking what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.710" end="00:13:43.880" style="s2">done or if I&#39;m on am I also</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.170" end="00:13:46.280" style="s2">simultaneously indicating what they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.880" end="00:13:47.960" style="s2">do so if I give them a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.280" end="00:13:50.570" style="s2">if I push them into the a range that</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.960" end="00:13:53.390" style="s2">might actually like in a self-fulfilling</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.570" end="00:13:55.910" style="s2">prophecy lift them into an a-student</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.390" end="00:13:57.410" style="s2">and what&#39;s my moral obligation here is</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.910" end="00:14:01.190" style="s2">my moral obligation to give them</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.410" end="00:14:03.620" style="s2">brutally objective truth or as my boodle</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.190" end="00:14:05.450" style="s2">is my moral obligation to make them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.620" end="00:14:09.110" style="s2">afford them to be the best student they</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.110" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">do okay what these dilemmas make clear</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.490" end="00:14:20.900" style="s2">is that the virtues are not independent</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:22.280" style="s2">from each other and we&#39;re not trying to</p>

<p begin="00:14:40.460" end="00:14:47.000" style="s2">some important these issues of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">we start to see some important things</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.000" end="00:14:54.260" style="s2">about our relationship to the virtues</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:58.340" style="s2">let me read a quote from you real-life</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.260" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">situations do not come labeled with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.340" end="00:15:03.770" style="s2">needed virtues or strength attached</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.330" style="s2">notice notice how this is the</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.330" end="00:15:11.660" style="s2">reference and and right all the stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.660" end="00:15:13.040" style="s2">talked about and notice how they zero</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.660" end="00:15:16.730" style="s2">right in on it because notice what they</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.040" end="00:15:20.690" style="s2">say next there is thus the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.730" end="00:15:22.700" style="s2">here it is and the this word is</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.690" end="00:15:25.790" style="s2">emphasized in the original there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.700" end="00:15:29.200" style="s2">problem of relevance which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.790" end="00:15:36.590" style="s2">relevant virtue to bring to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.200" end="00:15:38.240" style="s2">then of course not only is that so that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.590" end="00:15:43.070" style="s2">you see that do I bring honest is</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.240" end="00:15:47.270" style="s2">honesty the relevant virtue in these</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.070" end="00:15:48.589" style="s2">examples is mentorship they&#39;re relevant</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.270" end="00:15:52.410" style="s2">virtue</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.589" end="00:15:54.630" style="s2">guidance good guidance is kindness is</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.410" end="00:15:59.310" style="s2">being helpful like what&#39;s the what are</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.630" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">the relevant virtues and of course</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.310" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">what&#39;s also shown is the virtues can</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:07.490" style="s2">conflict with each other they often pull</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.079" end="00:16:12.180" style="s2">you into different kinds of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.490" end="00:16:13.829" style="s2">different kinds of behavior now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.180" end="00:16:14.940" style="s2">bring another thing back we often and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.829" end="00:16:16.769" style="s2">this is something that Schwartz and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.940" end="00:16:20.279" style="s2">sharp are going to make a lot out of we</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.769" end="00:16:21.510" style="s2">often represent virtues with rules and</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.279" end="00:16:24.329" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about this when we talked</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.510" end="00:16:27.180" style="s2">about rules remember and I write</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.329" end="00:16:31.740" style="s2">remember this rule and it&#39;s this is a a</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.180" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">virtue rule be kind do you remember the</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.740" end="00:16:38.310" style="s2">problem with that right that rule</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:40.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t specify its conditions it</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.310" end="00:16:42.209" style="s2">doesn&#39;t specify this is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.260" end="00:16:44.459" style="s2">specification it doesn&#39;t specify its</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.209" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">conditions of application being kind to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.459" end="00:16:48.180" style="s2">my son is not the same thing as being</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:50.190" style="s2">kind to my partner it&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.180" end="00:16:51.720" style="s2">thing as being kind to my students it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.190" end="00:16:53.459" style="s2">not the same thing as being kind to my</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.720" end="00:16:54.899" style="s2">friends not the same thing as being kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.459" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">to a stranger that&#39;s the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.899" end="00:16:57.870" style="s2">being kind of a stranger on the street</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">and being kind to a stranger somebody</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.870" end="00:17:01.920" style="s2">just met at a Funeral</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:04.169" style="s2">these are all different remember that</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.920" end="00:17:05.850" style="s2">that&#39;s why you can&#39;t capture relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.169" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">your cognitive commitment in a rule</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.850" end="00:17:11.669" style="s2">because you just have you&#39;d have to just</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:13.740" style="s2">get an ever expanding penumbra of rules</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.669" end="00:17:16.679" style="s2">for how to apply and specify that rule</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.740" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">rule application specification depends</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.679" end="00:17:23.730" style="s2">on relevance realization in fact unlike</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">Schwartz and sharp I think all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.730" end="00:17:27.449" style="s2">problems they list right the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.010" style="s2">relevance is clearly a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.449" end="00:17:31.770" style="s2">relevance realization the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.010" end="00:17:34.919" style="s2">conflict is a problem of determining</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.770" end="00:17:36.120" style="s2">which is more important right and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.919" end="00:17:38.960" style="s2">problem as i&#39;ve just argued of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.120" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">specification is also a problem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.960" end="00:17:42.799" style="s2">determining relevance</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.270" end="00:17:52.580" style="s2">I would add so they specify these three</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:54.800" style="s2">interconnected problems as I&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.580" end="00:17:57.080" style="s2">relevance conflict and specificity I</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.800" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">would add a fourth that they don&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.080" end="00:18:01.190" style="s2">about and this has to do with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:03.320" style="s2">that sometimes the best response to a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.190" end="00:18:07.690" style="s2">situation is to realize that I need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.320" end="00:18:11.030" style="s2">develop a virtue that I do not have</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.690" end="00:18:13.309" style="s2">it&#39;s an aspirational response rather</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.030" end="00:18:15.470" style="s2">than a select which of my virtues should</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.309" end="00:18:18.140" style="s2">I apply or there come how do i specified</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.470" end="00:18:21.350" style="s2">its might be oh jeez I&#39;m lacking a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.140" end="00:18:23.809" style="s2">virtue that I need I need to cultivate a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.350" end="00:18:26.090" style="s2">virtue that I do not have so I would add</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.809" end="00:18:27.590" style="s2">in right there in addition to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.090" end="00:18:29.540" style="s2">problem of relevance conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.590" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">specificity there&#39;s the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.540" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">development the need to aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:36.410" style="s2">acquire virtues you do not have and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">already shown you how much the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.410" end="00:18:40.250" style="s2">developmental process is dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:45.580" style="s2">capacity for insight and qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.250" end="00:18:50.300" style="s2">transformative experience etc all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.580" end="00:18:53.690" style="s2">so what are they proposing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.300" end="00:18:57.320" style="s2">proposing that we need a higher order so</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.690" end="00:19:00.820" style="s2">here&#39;s the virtues right we need a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.320" end="00:19:03.950" style="s2">higher order ability that deals with</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.820" end="00:19:04.820" style="s2">relevance they look put it as a list but</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.950" end="00:19:11.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to show you how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.820" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">related right conflict specificity</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.920" end="00:19:15.820" style="s2">specification sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.520" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">development well what would that be well</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.050" end="00:19:30.560" style="s2">they argue that&#39;s wisdom they argue that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:32.510" style="s2">that&#39;s wisdom wisdom is what you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.560" end="00:19:36.500" style="s2">notice what the argument they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.510" end="00:19:39.470" style="s2">here given the fact that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.500" end="00:19:41.810" style="s2">logically independent given that in very</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.470" end="00:19:43.850" style="s2">many situations right all of these</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.810" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">issues are brought to bear and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.850" end="00:19:48.770" style="s2">arguing and I think it&#39;s fair that this</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s centers on ability to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:57.140" style="s2">determine relevance right you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:20:00.740" style="s2">wisdom in order to be wise in fact one</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.140" end="00:20:02.390" style="s2">of the interpretations of the Greek the</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.740" end="00:20:04.670" style="s2">ancient Greek idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.390" end="00:20:06.680" style="s2">interdependence of the virtues it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.670" end="00:20:09.500" style="s2">that the virtues are all constraining on</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.680" end="00:20:12.110" style="s2">each other but that each virtue is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.500" end="00:20:15.620" style="s2">a particular way in which you&#39;re wise in</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.110" end="00:20:18.170" style="s2">a situation right so to be kind is how</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.620" end="00:20:19.790" style="s2">to be most wise in this situation to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.170" end="00:20:22.040" style="s2">honest is how to be most wise in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.790" end="00:20:23.990" style="s2">situation so that version of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.040" end="00:20:27.200" style="s2">interdependence of the virtues really</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.990" end="00:20:29.900" style="s2">really tightly ties the virtues to</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.200" end="00:20:34.810" style="s2">wisdom either way there is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.900" end="00:20:39.680" style="s2">connection between the cultivation and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.810" end="00:20:46.910" style="s2">the pursuit of a virtuous way of life</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.680" end="00:20:49.220" style="s2">and the cultivation of wisdom now this</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.910" end="00:20:51.020" style="s2">is where Schwartz and sharp and this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.220" end="00:20:53.780" style="s2">why their book is entitled practical</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.020" end="00:20:56.060" style="s2">wisdom and that&#39;s why the title of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.780" end="00:20:58.580" style="s2">article is practical wisdom because they</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.060" end="00:21:01.090" style="s2">call back to Aristotle&#39;s distinction</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.580" end="00:21:01.090" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">this is the distinction between Sophia</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:14.710" style="s2">which is in philosophy ax and phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.720" end="00:21:21.740" style="s2">right both of these words can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.010" end="00:21:24.350" style="s2">translated as wisdom this is often</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.740" end="00:21:26.900" style="s2">translated as theoretical wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.350" end="00:21:29.240" style="s2">this and then that becomes problematic</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.900" end="00:21:31.340" style="s2">because that&#39;s often assimilated to our</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.240" end="00:21:34.250" style="s2">idea of theoretical knowledge and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.340" end="00:21:36.410" style="s2">we lose a lot of what Sophia is right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.250" end="00:21:39.310" style="s2">and then phronesis is often translated</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.410" end="00:21:39.310" style="s2">as practical wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.040" end="00:21:49.250" style="s2">so what Schwarz and sharp want to argue</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.560" end="00:21:56.150" style="s2">is that phronesis is what you need for</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.250" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">virtue phronesis is the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.150" end="00:22:01.940" style="s2">very contextually sensitive to exercise</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:04.370" style="s2">good judgment to know what to do in this</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.940" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">situation so it overlaps very</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.370" end="00:22:09.200" style="s2">considerably with you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:11.480" style="s2">relationship between preach procedural</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.200" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">knowledge knowing how to do various</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.480" end="00:22:15.890" style="s2">things knowing how to be honest knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:18.410" style="s2">how to be kind and prospective or</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.890" end="00:22:20.540" style="s2">knowing a situational awareness of what</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.410" end="00:22:24.200" style="s2">is best fitted here what is most</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.540" end="00:22:26.390" style="s2">appropriate for here right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.200" end="00:22:29.540" style="s2">can see clearly why phronesis is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.390" end="00:22:32.980" style="s2">relevant and and one of the things they</p>

<p begin="00:22:44.900" end="00:22:51.130" style="s2">sort of critical of a Content idea of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.750" end="00:22:53.840" style="s2">being virtue being virtuous as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.130" end="00:22:56.810" style="s2">specifying as your baby whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.840" end="00:22:57.950" style="s2">this is cons for you I it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.810" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">something I&#39;m going to get into this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">certainly a view that many people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.210" end="00:23:04.670" style="s2">that the point the way in which you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:06.350" style="s2">virtuous is to have a set of rules moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.670" end="00:23:11.630" style="s2">Commandments and that you follow those</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.350" end="00:23:14.270" style="s2">rules as best you can and then what and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.630" end="00:23:16.220" style="s2">what that can lead to and the Schwartz</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.270" end="00:23:17.990" style="s2">has been critical of this elsewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.220" end="00:23:19.870" style="s2">some talks you can find on YouTube for</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.990" end="00:23:24.610" style="s2">example this has been this</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.870" end="00:23:26.590" style="s2">then sort of right this can lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.610" end="00:23:29.950" style="s2">attempt to try and legislate everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.590" end="00:23:31.570" style="s2">to try and specify everything in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.950" end="00:23:34.120" style="s2">of how we should behave in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.570" end="00:23:36.669" style="s2">rules and they&#39;re critical of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.120" end="00:23:38.409" style="s2">because first of all it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.669" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">notice the example of be kind if I try</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.409" end="00:23:41.620" style="s2">to make a log that we should be kind and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:43.480" style="s2">I have to make laws about all these</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.620" end="00:23:45.730" style="s2">different ways in which I specified</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.480" end="00:23:48.520" style="s2">being kind I&#39;d have to make laws that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.730" end="00:23:50.470" style="s2">tell me when I should give preference to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.520" end="00:23:52.710" style="s2">kindness over honesty across all</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.470" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">possible like it&#39;s just it&#39;s impossible</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.710" end="00:23:59.799" style="s2">right but you can get into an illusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:03.130" style="s2">this is part of Schwartz&#39;s that you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.799" end="00:24:08.049" style="s2">somehow replace people becoming wise</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.130" end="00:24:11.020" style="s2">with people having laws now obviously i</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.049" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">am not proposing anarchy like that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.020" end="00:24:15.700" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have laws or etc like that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:18.250" style="s2">that&#39;s not Schwartz&#39;s point he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.700" end="00:24:21.059" style="s2">proposing that that&#39;s absurd what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.250" end="00:24:25.029" style="s2">proposing is to step back and realize</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.059" end="00:24:29.020" style="s2">that we should have right this balance</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.029" end="00:24:31.270" style="s2">between proposing legislation and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.020" end="00:24:34.929" style="s2">requiring from people that they</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.270" end="00:24:36.250" style="s2">cultivate wisdom okay so he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.929" end="00:24:38.020" style="s2">that argument and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.250" end="00:24:41.010" style="s2">something that we should take into</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.020" end="00:24:44.799" style="s2">account we should ask ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.010" end="00:24:46.659" style="s2">not just will this legislation reduce</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.799" end="00:24:51.700" style="s2">harm that&#39;s a really important question</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.659" end="00:24:53.350" style="s2">okay for sure but we should also and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.700" end="00:24:56.590" style="s2">think this is also an important question</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.350" end="00:24:59.200" style="s2">will this legislation tend to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.590" end="00:25:03.429" style="s2">people less likely to pursue the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.200" end="00:25:04.950" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom and virtue okay so</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.429" end="00:25:08.049" style="s2">you have to have to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.950" end="00:25:09.730" style="s2">issue short his argument I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.049" end="00:25:11.350" style="s2">an argument that should be taken</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.730" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">seriously and that&#39;s why of course he</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.350" end="00:25:16.120" style="s2">keeps making it anything he&#39;s getting a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:19.000" style="s2">considerable audience around it okay</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.120" end="00:25:22.120" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to the main point they</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.000" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">tend to leave this out because they tend</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.120" end="00:25:28.480" style="s2">to associate Sophia I think unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:30.740" style="s2">with the having of having rules they</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.480" end="00:25:32.630" style="s2">assimilated I think too much</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.740" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">you theoretical knowledge and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.630" end="00:25:36.860" style="s2">possession of propositions of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.790" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">rules are propositions you&#39;re proposing</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.860" end="00:25:44.980" style="s2">what people should do proposing very</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.110" end="00:25:47.059" style="s2">strongly right and they see Sophia as</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.980" end="00:25:51.280" style="s2">theoretical knowledge largely</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.059" end="00:25:54.050" style="s2">propositional i I think that&#39;s an unfair</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.280" end="00:25:56.059" style="s2">representation of Sophia and other</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.050" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">people have pointed that this out and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.059" end="00:26:01.910" style="s2">whereas I think look this is about being</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:04.550" style="s2">very contextually sensitive and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.910" end="00:26:07.820" style="s2">very important because that allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.550" end="00:26:11.510" style="s2">generate the process needed in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.820" end="00:26:13.250" style="s2">situation I need to start behaving you</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.510" end="00:26:17.260" style="s2">know in this sort of balance between</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.250" end="00:26:20.540" style="s2">being kind and honest right</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.260" end="00:26:22.370" style="s2">but I also need this and I instead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.540" end="00:26:24.860" style="s2">thinking of this as rules and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.370" end="00:26:27.350" style="s2">possession of propositions are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.860" end="00:26:31.429" style="s2">analogous to the content model let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.350" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">think of this instead as right the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.429" end="00:26:37.970" style="s2">awareness of principles so for me this</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:41.660" style="s2">is about getting you right into a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.970" end="00:26:44.360" style="s2">process the contextual sensitivity that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.660" end="00:26:46.309" style="s2">the the prospective of situational</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.360" end="00:26:49.160" style="s2">awareness activating the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.309" end="00:26:51.800" style="s2">procedures in the appropriate way so</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.160" end="00:26:54.380" style="s2">that I fit the situation right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.800" end="00:26:56.630" style="s2">great but I also need across contextual</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.380" end="00:26:59.360" style="s2">sensitivity I need to pick up on things</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.630" end="00:27:00.309" style="s2">that are generalizable across different</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.360" end="00:27:02.900" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.309" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">right and of course that is partially</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.900" end="00:27:07.220" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to do with our laws</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:10.520" style="s2">hence that hence the connection but to</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.220" end="00:27:12.170" style="s2">reduce this to just the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.520" end="00:27:14.929" style="s2">generate propositional knowledge I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.170" end="00:27:17.179" style="s2">is a mistake that&#39;s not what Sophia is</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.929" end="00:27:19.190" style="s2">Sophia is something like a deep kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.179" end="00:27:21.710" style="s2">ontological depth perception it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.190" end="00:27:24.230" style="s2">able to see deep underlying principles</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.710" end="00:27:26.510" style="s2">because what I need to know really and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.230" end="00:27:29.390" style="s2">this was Aristotle&#39;s point right I need</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.510" end="00:27:32.660" style="s2">both of them I need to know how to put</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.390" end="00:27:35.150" style="s2">principles into processes and I need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.660" end="00:27:36.920" style="s2">know how to regulate processes with</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.150" end="00:27:39.559" style="s2">principles that&#39;s what it is to put a</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.920" end="00:27:41.929" style="s2">principle into practice and to practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.559" end="00:27:43.340" style="s2">in a principled manner so I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.929" end="00:27:47.059" style="s2">against Schwartz and Sharpe</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.340" end="00:27:48.980" style="s2">that you need both sofia and from you</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.059" end="00:27:52.370" style="s2">sis you need something that is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.980" end="00:27:55.820" style="s2">pick up on cross contextual invariance</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.370" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">and you need something that is designing</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.820" end="00:28:00.169" style="s2">helping you - and of course this is in</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:02.120" style="s2">line with the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.169" end="00:28:04.429" style="s2">model I have argued something that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.120" end="00:28:06.769" style="s2">the aspect of wisdom that is about</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.429" end="00:28:08.629" style="s2">contextual sensitivity what&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.769" end="00:28:10.669" style="s2">here what&#39;s special here how do I fit</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.629" end="00:28:12.679" style="s2">myself to this specific situation as</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.669" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">opposed to how do I generalize across</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.679" end="00:28:17.779" style="s2">these many situations and what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:20.749" style="s2">an opponent relationship between them so</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.779" end="00:28:23.929" style="s2">that I can discover powerful principles</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.749" end="00:28:27.879" style="s2">and put them into effective practice and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.929" end="00:28:32.509" style="s2">so that I can regulate my practices with</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.879" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">well justified principles so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.509" end="00:28:38.869" style="s2">that that&#39;s a very crucial issue there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:43.429" style="s2">one other issue about Schwartz and sharp</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.869" end="00:28:45.049" style="s2">that I want to come back to I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.429" end="00:28:47.779" style="s2">they&#39;re right in saying that phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.049" end="00:28:49.519" style="s2">is a kind of know-how a procedural</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.779" end="00:28:53.960" style="s2">knowledge I think it&#39;s more it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.519" end="00:28:55.789" style="s2">perspectival and potentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.960" end="00:28:59.749" style="s2">participatory but at least perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.789" end="00:29:03.529" style="s2">and one of the things they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.749" end="00:29:06.169" style="s2">they talk about this in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.529" end="00:29:08.809" style="s2">language of expertise of being an expert</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.169" end="00:29:10.730" style="s2">which is different and then what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.809" end="00:29:12.769" style="s2">trying to do with that contract is write</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.730" end="00:29:14.539" style="s2">an expert doesn&#39;t necessarily possess</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.769" end="00:29:16.940" style="s2">the best theory they write they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.539" end="00:29:20.360" style="s2">have the knowledge that the expert has</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.940" end="00:29:21.710" style="s2">the best know-how expertise is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.360" end="00:29:25.690" style="s2">excellence in know-how</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.710" end="00:29:29.629" style="s2">I think because they&#39;ve sort of not</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.690" end="00:29:31.490" style="s2">because they&#39;ve focused in on from nice</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.629" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">is separate from Sofia and they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.490" end="00:29:37.090" style="s2">thought of know-how without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:40.570" style="s2">also of the prospective all-knowing I</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.090" end="00:29:40.570" style="s2">think this is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.350" end="00:29:54.520" style="s2">here&#39;s why I I think that expert eat</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.370" end="00:29:56.930" style="s2">well I&#39;m trying to be careful here</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.520" end="00:29:58.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which this we can be we</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.930" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">can equivocate with this word we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.910" end="00:30:03.740" style="s2">just mean that we can what we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:06.170" style="s2">use this to me just good like you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.740" end="00:30:08.180" style="s2">excellent you know that&#39;s what expertise</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.170" end="00:30:10.610" style="s2">is and that&#39;s a very loose way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.180" end="00:30:13.430" style="s2">talking but if you&#39;re trying to use it</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.610" end="00:30:16.930" style="s2">within psychologically in a more precise</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.430" end="00:30:21.640" style="s2">manner expertise is a domain-specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.930" end="00:30:21.640" style="s2">thing and we&#39;ve talked about this before</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.030" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">right so I can become a tennis expert</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.450" end="00:30:31.700" style="s2">like my know-how can rise to a level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.890" style="s2">authority and notice that my being an</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.700" end="00:30:35.240" style="s2">expert in tennis you&#39;ve done this before</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.890" end="00:30:38.510" style="s2">but let&#39;s do it again maybe being an</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.240" end="00:30:42.920" style="s2">expert in tennis doesn&#39;t give me any</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.510" end="00:30:45.260" style="s2">special authority over squash in fact my</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.920" end="00:30:48.490" style="s2">expertise in tennis can dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.260" end="00:30:51.350" style="s2">interfere with my playing squash so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.490" end="00:30:53.300" style="s2">typically what happens in expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.350" end="00:30:56.030" style="s2">it tends to be very domain-specific</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.300" end="00:30:59.330" style="s2">which is precisely why you can get very</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.030" end="00:31:04.700" style="s2">focused training on it and become very</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.330" end="00:31:06.500" style="s2">good like tennis here&#39;s my my problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.700" end="00:31:08.570" style="s2">with understanding from Mises and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.500" end="00:31:11.540" style="s2">therefore also the relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.570" end="00:31:13.700" style="s2">virtue on the model of expertise the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.540" end="00:31:16.010" style="s2">domain specificity of expertise if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.700" end="00:31:20.060" style="s2">using the current term carefully is not</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.010" end="00:31:21.500" style="s2">what I need here right it&#39;s not what I</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.060" end="00:31:26.510" style="s2">need and you&#39;re saying ah but phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.500" end="00:31:28.160" style="s2">is context-sensitive yes it is and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.510" end="00:31:30.530" style="s2">perhaps that&#39;s the source of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.160" end="00:31:34.220" style="s2">confusion being context-sensitive isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.530" end="00:31:36.470" style="s2">the same thing as being having expertise</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.220" end="00:31:39.710" style="s2">and you say but that sounds similar well</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.470" end="00:31:42.020" style="s2">let&#39;s pull it apart right what from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.710" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">nieces is and so let&#39;s do this very</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.020" end="00:31:46.760" style="s2">carefully Vinicius is not like expertise</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:48.470" style="s2">in tennis which I can only apply here</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.760" end="00:31:50.480" style="s2">and in fact if I try to transfer it to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.470" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">something even similar it will interfere</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:55.450" style="s2">I would argue that what phronesis is is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.519" style="s2">my ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.450" end="00:32:00.499" style="s2">sensitive in this context and sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.519" end="00:32:03.349" style="s2">in this context and sensitive in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.499" end="00:32:06.409" style="s2">context and that is very very different</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.349" end="00:32:12.739" style="s2">that is very very different from</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.409" end="00:32:16.849" style="s2">expertise right so what we need is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.739" end="00:32:19.219" style="s2">domain general ability now this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.849" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">contradiction your ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.219" end="00:32:23.570" style="s2">contextually sensitive is itself a</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:25.309" style="s2">domain general ability I have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.570" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">to be contextually sensitive in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.309" end="00:32:29.809" style="s2">different domains and so I&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:32.599" style="s2">that there&#39;s a bit of confusion here and</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.809" end="00:32:37.190" style="s2">if you pull it apart what we need is an</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.599" end="00:32:41.739" style="s2">ability right to be contextually</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.190" end="00:32:45.139" style="s2">sensitive but in a domain general way</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.739" end="00:32:48.109" style="s2">across many domains so you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.139" end="00:32:50.359" style="s2">things like well intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.109" end="00:32:52.099" style="s2">rationality or I would argue the ability</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.359" end="00:32:53.960" style="s2">to realize relevance which always has a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.099" end="00:32:55.779" style="s2">contextually sensitive component to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.960" end="00:32:59.479" style="s2">are much better ways of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.779" end="00:33:02.389" style="s2">phronesis then expertise because this</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.479" end="00:33:04.580" style="s2">those ways of talking are domain general</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.389" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">they have each one of them has an aspect</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.580" end="00:33:09.739" style="s2">that is the domain general ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:10.839" style="s2">contextually sensitive here and here and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.739" end="00:33:14.210" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.839" end="00:33:17.989" style="s2">and that&#39;s important because you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.210" end="00:33:20.779" style="s2">what you&#39;re not foolish generally in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.989" end="00:33:22.999" style="s2">domain specific way specific domains may</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.779" end="00:33:26.179" style="s2">make you more foolish but we all</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.999" end="00:33:28.009" style="s2">wonderfully have the ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.179" end="00:33:31.309" style="s2">foolish in almost every domain of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.009" end="00:33:39.080" style="s2">life often many domains simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.309" end="00:33:43.489" style="s2">in a disastrous chaos so I would argue</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.080" end="00:33:46.909" style="s2">that we shouldn&#39;t confuse that phronesis</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.489" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">is about context sensitivity with</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.909" end="00:33:52.309" style="s2">expertise which is locked to a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:56.839" style="s2">particular domain we should think of</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.309" end="00:33:59.179" style="s2">something much more like intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.839" end="00:34:02.629" style="s2">rationality relevance realization which</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.179" end="00:34:05.419" style="s2">can apply across multiple domains make</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.629" end="00:34:07.940" style="s2">you a general problem solver and deal</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.419" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">with the domain generality of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.940" end="00:34:10.960" style="s2">capacity for foolish</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.950" end="00:34:21.320" style="s2">and so I think my two main response I so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.630" end="00:34:26.899" style="s2">let&#39;s draw this together the argument</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.320" end="00:34:29.929" style="s2">for the connection between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.899" end="00:34:34.130" style="s2">virtue I think is very powerful solid</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.929" end="00:34:37.250" style="s2">argument the argument that that should</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.130" end="00:34:41.000" style="s2">make us more hesitant to trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.250" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">capture wisdom just with rule so like</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.000" end="00:34:45.260" style="s2">virtue just with rules I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:46.760" style="s2">that&#39;s an argument I&#39;m sympathetic wick</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.260" end="00:34:53.690" style="s2">I think that&#39;s going in the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.760" end="00:34:56.780" style="s2">direction the argument that phronesis is</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.690" end="00:34:59.060" style="s2">all we need for virtue when I question I</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.780" end="00:35:03.980" style="s2">think of following Aristotle&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.060" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">phronesis and Sophia should be in a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.980" end="00:35:09.290" style="s2">powerful opponent relationship you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:11.270" style="s2">trying to get principles into processes</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.290" end="00:35:18.310" style="s2">and process is regulated by principles</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.270" end="00:35:22.580" style="s2">etc and the idea of trying to capture</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.310" end="00:35:25.100" style="s2">the procedure allottee phronesis with</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.580" end="00:35:26.900" style="s2">the notion of expertise I think is as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.100" end="00:35:31.700" style="s2">confusion as I&#39;ve argued and we should</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.900" end="00:35:37.310" style="s2">put that aside okay I now want to pick</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.700" end="00:35:41.000" style="s2">up on one of the I mean I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.310" end="00:35:44.420" style="s2">a fair way of saying it one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.000" end="00:35:46.600" style="s2">seminal theories psychological theories</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.420" end="00:35:53.240" style="s2">of wisdom in many ways this theory</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.600" end="00:35:54.680" style="s2">turned the investigation of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.240" end="00:36:01.090" style="s2">psychological investigation of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.680" end="00:36:05.120" style="s2">into an experimental empirical process</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.090" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">and so this is the important work of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.120" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">bolts and starting er</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.730" end="00:36:26.740" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Berlin wisdom paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.460" end="00:36:32.710" style="s2">they&#39;re both working in Berlin obviously</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.740" end="00:36:39.430" style="s2">they&#39;re German and so what I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.710" end="00:36:41.230" style="s2">is go to there it&#39;s you know it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.430" end="00:36:42.970" style="s2">hard to to tell you what to refer to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.230" end="00:36:45.819" style="s2">because they ship their work shows up in</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.970" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">multiple articles multiple handbooks on</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.819" end="00:36:51.880" style="s2">wisdom but the article I think that many</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:56.650" style="s2">people regard as sort of the seminal one</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.880" end="00:36:59.950" style="s2">is an article entitled with them as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.650" end="00:37:03.160" style="s2">meta heuristic yielding sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.950" end="00:37:09.549" style="s2">getting the wrong quote here sorry here</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.160" end="00:37:13.260" style="s2">I just want to get into it wisdom a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.549" end="00:37:14.829" style="s2">metahuman to orchestrate mind and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.260" end="00:37:17.460" style="s2">towards excellence</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.829" end="00:37:21.220" style="s2">okay so sorry for that little delay</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.460" end="00:37:25.540" style="s2">wisdom a metahuman in brackets pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.220" end="00:37:26.079" style="s2">to orchestrate mind and virtue towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.540" end="00:37:29.410" style="s2">excellence</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.079" end="00:37:31.390" style="s2">so notice right here the title tells you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.410" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">that they&#39;ve accepted deeply accepted</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.390" end="00:37:39.180" style="s2">the point by made by Schwartz and sharp</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:39.180" style="s2">that there&#39;s a deep connection between</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:45.880" style="s2">wisdom and virtue orchestrating mind and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.290" end="00:37:48.040" style="s2">virtue towards excellence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.880" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">already the deep connection to positive</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.040" end="00:37:53.589" style="s2">psychology but also notice something the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:57.880" style="s2">invocation of the term am at a heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.589" end="00:38:00.910" style="s2">and the notion of pragmatics tells us</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.880" end="00:38:03.490" style="s2">that relevance realization is playing a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.910" end="00:38:09.450" style="s2">very significant role in this theory at</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.490" end="00:38:09.450" style="s2">least I will argue that okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.860" end="00:38:21.550" style="s2">so let&#39;s first of all deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.510" end="00:38:24.970" style="s2">notion that they put in brackets of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.550" end="00:38:28.540" style="s2">pragmatics because they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.970" end="00:38:30.940" style="s2">picking up on a couple different related</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.540" end="00:38:34.930" style="s2">but not identical meanings associated</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.940" end="00:38:37.780" style="s2">with that term one is having to do with</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.930" end="00:38:40.110" style="s2">I think like the pragmatic aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.780" end="00:38:43.420" style="s2">language pragmatics</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.110" end="00:38:44.770" style="s2">so there&#39;s syntax semantics semantics</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.420" end="00:38:46.740" style="s2">and pragmatics then we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.770" end="00:38:49.570" style="s2">when we talked about grace and</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.740" end="00:38:51.400" style="s2">conversational implicature right that</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.570" end="00:38:54.190" style="s2">you always are conveying much more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.400" end="00:38:56.860" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and that how that depends</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.190" end="00:38:59.560" style="s2">on capacity for relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.860" end="00:39:04.450" style="s2">and you can see and so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.560" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">sense of that dealing with how much our</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.450" end="00:39:09.040" style="s2">communication and more broadly our</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:12.720" style="s2">cognition goes beyond what we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.040" end="00:39:15.400" style="s2">directly propositional II represent</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.720" end="00:39:17.890" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely there there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.400" end="00:39:22.150" style="s2">meaning of pragmatics and that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.890" end="00:39:23.620" style="s2">with pragmatism which I haven&#39;t talked</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.150" end="00:39:27.910" style="s2">about I&#39;m going to talk about it later I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.620" end="00:39:32.920" style="s2">want to talk briefly about James and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.910" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">the idea behind pragmatism is so sorry I</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.920" end="00:39:39.580" style="s2">like I said there&#39;s a there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:42.550" style="s2">there but the idea about pragmatism I</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:43.840" style="s2">would argue a way of understanding it at</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.550" end="00:39:47.980" style="s2">least the way of understanding James</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.840" end="00:39:49.650" style="s2">James is one of my heroes James was both</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.980" end="00:39:53.620" style="s2">a great psychologist and a great</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.650" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2">philosopher and he was interested so</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.620" end="00:39:57.160" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a protocol goon of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:39:58.690" style="s2">scientist and he but he isn&#39;t interested</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.160" end="00:40:00.340" style="s2">just in cognition he&#39;s interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.690" end="00:40:02.350" style="s2">much very much and you know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.340" end="00:40:04.870" style="s2">to live a good life he he starts some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.350" end="00:40:07.620" style="s2">the earliest work on you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.870" end="00:40:10.390" style="s2">study of mystical experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.620" end="00:40:13.600" style="s2">religion psychological investigation so</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.390" end="00:40:17.170" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s just a really pivotal figure</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.600" end="00:40:19.420" style="s2">for me and for many people but one way I</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.170" end="00:40:21.940" style="s2">would argue is what Brooke what James</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.420" end="00:40:24.260" style="s2">was on about is that you should evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.940" end="00:40:26.750" style="s2">your knowledge claims ultimately in</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.260" end="00:40:30.440" style="s2">terms of their efficaciousness how much</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.750" end="00:40:33.560" style="s2">they can be viably used in your life in</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.440" end="00:40:36.380" style="s2">order to adapt you to the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.560" end="00:40:38.330" style="s2">one one way of thinking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.380" end="00:40:39.800" style="s2">your propositional claims ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.330" end="00:40:42.710" style="s2">have to be grounded in your procedural</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.800" end="00:40:45.230" style="s2">abilities I could James doesn&#39;t use this</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.710" end="00:40:46.790" style="s2">language but I could find passages in</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.230" end="00:40:50.710" style="s2">James that clearly point to it I would</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.790" end="00:40:52.880" style="s2">argue that your you know your your your</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.710" end="00:40:54.380" style="s2">propositional knowing has to be grounded</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.880" end="00:40:55.760" style="s2">in your procedural abilities which have</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.380" end="00:40:57.620" style="s2">to be grounded in your perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.760" end="00:41:00.260" style="s2">which have to be grounded ultimately and</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.620" end="00:41:01.250" style="s2">your your participatory James was very</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.260" end="00:41:02.660" style="s2">interested in the phenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.250" end="00:41:04.730" style="s2">conversion when people go through these</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.660" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">massive identity changes and how that</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.730" end="00:41:12.200" style="s2">changes the world that they can live in</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:13.670" style="s2">now I think that&#39;s deeply right but</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.200" end="00:41:16.130" style="s2">there are also some problems with</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.670" end="00:41:17.840" style="s2">pragmatism I&#39;ll come back to this so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.130" end="00:41:20.120" style="s2">I&#39;ll just mention it now I think there</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.840" end="00:41:21.830" style="s2">is a confusion at least a potential</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.120" end="00:41:26.720" style="s2">confusion between truth and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.830" end="00:41:28.670" style="s2">and and that can be problematic now why</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.720" end="00:41:30.350" style="s2">does all of that matter well because as</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.670" end="00:41:33.170" style="s2">I just tried to show you pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.350" end="00:41:34.970" style="s2">tries to situate your what James would</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.170" end="00:41:39.020" style="s2">call sort of your intellectual claims</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.970" end="00:41:42.950" style="s2">right into this deeper lived experienced</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.020" end="00:41:45.620" style="s2">viable ability to fit your world to</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.950" end="00:41:49.460" style="s2">develop your connectedness to develop</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.620" end="00:41:52.100" style="s2">yourself both of those I think can</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.460" end="00:41:53.870" style="s2">plausibly be brought back together in</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.100" end="00:41:56.030" style="s2">the notion that you know what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.870" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">talking about and then and then then</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.030" end="00:41:59.870" style="s2">this just goes so well with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">invocation of the term meta heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.870" end="00:42:03.830" style="s2">our heuristic for managing your</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:07.240" style="s2">heuristics we can draw this together and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.830" end="00:42:11.060" style="s2">this term together meta heuristic right</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.240" end="00:42:13.280" style="s2">we can draw this right all together with</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.060" end="00:42:15.670" style="s2">well having to deal with realizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.280" end="00:42:15.670" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.320" end="00:42:28.040" style="s2">this is in vote not not an in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.660" end="00:42:29.900" style="s2">the theoretical account I&#39;ve given but</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.040" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">the idea that zeroing in on relevant</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.900" end="00:42:34.820" style="s2">information is crucial to wisdom this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">invoked throughout the article by bolts</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.820" end="00:42:42.200" style="s2">and onager let&#39;s be clear I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:44.900" style="s2">they are explicitly making a case the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.200" end="00:42:47.300" style="s2">way I am what I&#39;m saying is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.900" end="00:42:50.830" style="s2">invoking ideas and making use of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.300" end="00:42:53.660" style="s2">that ultimately deeply presuppose the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.830" end="00:43:00.700" style="s2">villa the ability for relevance</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.660" end="00:43:05.540" style="s2">realization now they have an account of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.700" end="00:43:08.330" style="s2">the five criteria you need in order to</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.540" end="00:43:13.900" style="s2">be wise and the point about this is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.330" end="00:43:13.900" style="s2">try and specify what these medical</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.190" end="00:43:22.750" style="s2">inspection of mind and virtue together</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.690" end="00:43:26.570" style="s2">so that we become excellent human beings</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.750" end="00:43:29.510" style="s2">excellent persons they try to specify</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.570" end="00:43:31.490" style="s2">this in terms of five criteria the point</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.510" end="00:43:35.960" style="s2">of the criteria are these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.490" end="00:43:40.460" style="s2">the features that are needed to judge</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.960" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">someone wise and also these are features</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.460" end="00:43:49.760" style="s2">that can be empirically investigated</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:52.990" style="s2">okay so what are these criteria so rich</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.760" end="00:43:59.870" style="s2">factual knowledge about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.990" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">pragmatics of life right so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.870" end="00:44:05.690" style="s2">is in some sense like Sophia this person</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:09.410" style="s2">has a deep grasp of the facts they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.690" end="00:44:15.170" style="s2">the principles of the practice under</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.410" end="00:44:18.320" style="s2">mental pragmatics of life they also need</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.170" end="00:44:19.940" style="s2">rich procedural knowledge about the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.320" end="00:44:21.980" style="s2">fundamental pragmatics of life and this</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.940" end="00:44:25.010" style="s2">goes back to the mcgee and barbara point</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.980" end="00:44:26.870" style="s2">right that wisdom is not so much what</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.010" end="00:44:28.850" style="s2">you know but how you know it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.870" end="00:44:33.080" style="s2">about knowing how to put these</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.850" end="00:44:35.120" style="s2">principles into practice into process</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.080" end="00:44:37.340" style="s2">now they they of course have now done</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.120" end="00:44:40.340" style="s2">propositional and procedural knowledge I</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.340" end="00:44:41.590" style="s2">think they should have gone deeper they</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.340" end="00:44:43.160" style="s2">obviously are going to need</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.590" end="00:44:44.870" style="s2">participatory knowledge because they</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.160" end="00:44:47.120" style="s2">have to explain how we go through</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.870" end="00:44:49.940" style="s2">traumatic developmental change because</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.120" end="00:44:51.800" style="s2">presumably qualitative changed is what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.940" end="00:44:55.700" style="s2">needed for wisdom hence the term</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.800" end="00:44:57.440" style="s2">excellence all right and of course they</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.700" end="00:45:01.730" style="s2">are missing the perspective of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.440" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">that connects the procedural knowing to</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.730" end="00:45:10.550" style="s2">you know specific contexts situational</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:14.300" style="s2">awareness okay so that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.550" end="00:45:17.210" style="s2">important I think they&#39;re pointing</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.300" end="00:45:19.070" style="s2">towards this prospective all-knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.210" end="00:45:20.870" style="s2">how it ultimately plugs into</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.070" end="00:45:23.780" style="s2">participatory when they invoke the next</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.870" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">criteria they call it lifespan</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.780" end="00:45:29.870" style="s2">contextualism lifespan contextualism</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:32.510" style="s2">like I say this is a kind of respectable</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.870" end="00:45:35.150" style="s2">knowing this is the way in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.510" end="00:45:37.730" style="s2">you know you&#39;re taking the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.150" end="00:45:41.210" style="s2">your ability to zoom out and then from</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.730" end="00:45:44.440" style="s2">that big picture zoom in as needed right</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.210" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">so it&#39;s this perspective all-knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.440" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">that I think is very crucial I think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:54.020" style="s2">has a lot to do with our capacities for</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:46:00.260" style="s2">self-regulation and we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.020" end="00:46:02.920" style="s2">that now the next one I want I want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.260" end="00:46:06.620" style="s2">state it then I want to challenge it</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.920" end="00:46:14.390" style="s2">this is they call it relativism of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.620" end="00:46:19.940" style="s2">values and priorities right I find that</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.390" end="00:46:26.480" style="s2">a hard criterion to be be beats or to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.940" end="00:46:29.990" style="s2">tethered to I if they&#39;re using this term</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.480" end="00:46:32.110" style="s2">carefully I don&#39;t think that many of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.990" end="00:46:34.520" style="s2">people that I would regard as</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.110" end="00:46:38.210" style="s2">quintessentially wise were moral</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.520" end="00:46:40.190" style="s2">relativists I do not think Socrates or</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.210" end="00:46:43.100" style="s2">Plato were moral relativist I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.190" end="00:46:45.650" style="s2">they&#39;re clearly the opposite I I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.100" end="00:46:47.990" style="s2">it&#39;s unlikely that the Buddha</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.650" end="00:46:51.970" style="s2">morale was a moral relativists or jesus</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.970" end="00:47:00.019" style="s2">think we are falling prey to thinking</p>

<p begin="00:47:08.269" end="00:47:14.930" style="s2">the notion of wisdom to those values I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.319" end="00:47:17.299" style="s2">think what might be on offer here what</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.930" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">they&#39;re actually talking about is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.299" end="00:47:24.109" style="s2">capacity for tolerance and perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:28.130" style="s2">way we could understand that then is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.109" end="00:47:30.410" style="s2">instead of a kind of relativism we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.130" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">understand it in terms that we can apply</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.410" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">to Socrates of a fallibilism which is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:42.140" style="s2">claim that you should never assert</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:45.650" style="s2">certainty right we can we can easily</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.140" end="00:47:49.519" style="s2">attribute that to Socrates and things</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.650" end="00:47:52.630" style="s2">analogous Jesus is regular condemnation</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.519" end="00:47:55.430" style="s2">of self-righteousness seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.630" end="00:47:57.289" style="s2">appropriate here so a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.430" end="00:47:59.299" style="s2">fallibilism and then link to something</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.289" end="00:48:07.960" style="s2">that you&#39;ve heard me mention multiple</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.299" end="00:48:12.710" style="s2">times humility humility a recognition an</p>

<p begin="00:48:12.710" end="00:48:21.920" style="s2">etc so if we bring in fallibilism and</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.859" end="00:48:25.670" style="s2">humility rather than requiring wise</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.920" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">people to demonstrate moral relativism I</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.670" end="00:48:32.690" style="s2">think we can plausibly apply this</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:37.430" style="s2">criteria to many exemplars of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.690" end="00:48:43.039" style="s2">from the past the fifth one and I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.430" end="00:48:46.430" style="s2">this is very crucial is recognition and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.039" end="00:48:52.819" style="s2">management of uncertainty recognition</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.430" end="00:48:55.220" style="s2">and management of uncertainty so this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.819" end="00:48:57.920" style="s2">to say right we are in the finitary</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.220" end="00:48:59.540" style="s2">predicament most of the time we can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.920" end="00:49:03.230" style="s2">algorithmic processing we</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.540" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">cannot pursue certainty we have to act</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.230" end="00:49:10.100" style="s2">as best we can with you with within</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:13.160" style="s2">unavoidable contexts of uncertainty so</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.100" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">you can see why I see why I think this</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.160" end="00:49:21.160" style="s2">theory is sort of dripping in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:21.160" style="s2">machinery of relevance realization I</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.030" end="00:49:26.660" style="s2">think the term meta heuristic is very</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.530" end="00:49:27.830" style="s2">good I think the meta meta heuristic is</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.660" end="00:49:30.460" style="s2">something that coordinates between</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.830" end="00:49:32.420" style="s2">heuristics it might be something like an</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.460" end="00:49:34.940" style="s2">optimization within a dynamical system</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.420" end="00:49:37.580" style="s2">like I argued you know trade-off between</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.940" end="00:49:40.910" style="s2">compression and particularization things</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.580" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">like that they at times though</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.910" end="00:49:46.850" style="s2">tend to talk about this meta heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">as a form of expertise and I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.850" end="00:49:51.370" style="s2">made the criticism I think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:54.860" style="s2">mistake I think that understanding</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.370" end="00:49:58.400" style="s2">wisdom as expertise is to mislead us</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.860" end="00:50:00.620" style="s2">again it causes us to over focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.400" end="00:50:02.390" style="s2">important procedural knowledge to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.620" end="00:50:06.020" style="s2">exclusion of the perspective of another</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.390" end="00:50:09.020" style="s2">participatory it also confuses you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.020" end="00:50:11.840" style="s2">the context sensitivity with you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.020" end="00:50:13.400" style="s2">being being domain-specific and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.840" end="00:50:15.730" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do that and I&#39;ve made that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.400" end="00:50:18.980" style="s2">argument I&#39;m not going to make it again</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.730" end="00:50:23.740" style="s2">instead I want to point out that what</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.980" end="00:50:27.590" style="s2">they tend to be arguing for is a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.740" end="00:50:30.830" style="s2">very comprehensive kind of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.590" end="00:50:32.780" style="s2">flexibility and that that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.830" end="00:50:35.270" style="s2">adaptability that your cognition is</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.780" end="00:50:37.850" style="s2">flexible enough that it can adapt itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.270" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">to different situations in a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.850" end="00:50:47.840" style="s2">efficacious manner what&#39;s important is</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:51.860" style="s2">that they started to generate semi</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.840" end="00:50:56.180" style="s2">empirical work well how do you do this</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.860" end="00:50:59.810" style="s2">well you you basically train independent</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.180" end="00:51:02.030" style="s2">judges to be able to evaluate these</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.810" end="00:51:04.910" style="s2">criteria in people&#39;s behavior their</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.030" end="00:51:07.660" style="s2">spoken behavior things like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.910" end="00:51:11.120" style="s2">and then what you do is you put people</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.660" end="00:51:13.260" style="s2">into various situations often situations</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.120" end="00:51:15.660" style="s2">that might involve moral dilemmas</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.260" end="00:51:18.060" style="s2">other more practical challenges and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.660" end="00:51:19.950" style="s2">get those people to relate on how they</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.060" end="00:51:21.690" style="s2">would deal with those difficult</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.950" end="00:51:25.380" style="s2">situations you try to find some</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.690" end="00:51:28.800" style="s2">situations that we would prototypically</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.380" end="00:51:31.350" style="s2">do do this for we would say for somebody</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.800" end="00:51:33.630" style="s2">who handled them well in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.350" end="00:51:36.330" style="s2">in that situation we would be quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.630" end="00:51:37.740" style="s2">happy with with attributing wisdom to</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.330" end="00:51:39.720" style="s2">them they&#39;d say yeah if somebody man</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.740" end="00:51:41.400" style="s2">into this situation really well that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.720" end="00:51:43.650" style="s2">would be good evidence for me</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.400" end="00:51:45.330" style="s2">for calling them wise now what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.650" end="00:51:48.390" style="s2">reverse engineer that take those</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.330" end="00:51:50.490" style="s2">situations that if solves successfully</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.390" end="00:51:53.210" style="s2">would generally lead to the attribution</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.490" end="00:51:56.910" style="s2">of wisdom give them to a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.210" end="00:51:59.250" style="s2">evaluate how in the answers that people</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.910" end="00:52:00.960" style="s2">are giving not just sort of vaguely how</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.250" end="00:52:03.090" style="s2">well the they answer it</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.960" end="00:52:05.970" style="s2">but do they answer it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.090" end="00:52:08.940" style="s2">exemplifies these five criteria and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.970" end="00:52:13.620" style="s2">you can judge how well people are doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.940" end="00:52:17.510" style="s2">in solving these problems and so what</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.620" end="00:52:20.550" style="s2">you got was some of the first attempts</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.510" end="00:52:23.490" style="s2">to start to empirically measure wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.550" end="00:52:25.110" style="s2">by putting people see what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.490" end="00:52:26.970" style="s2">this is analogous on how we test</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.110" end="00:52:28.560" style="s2">intelligence and rationality we give</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.970" end="00:52:30.630" style="s2">people a bunch of tests across</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.560" end="00:52:33.600" style="s2">situations and we try to see how they do</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.630" end="00:52:36.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s and then we start to generate</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.600" end="00:52:38.810" style="s2">from that a measure of how wise they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.180" end="00:52:45.840" style="s2">I think this is as I said this is just</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.810" end="00:52:50.940" style="s2">quintessentially important so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.840" end="00:52:53.900" style="s2">things I want to bring out they talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.940" end="00:53:03.540" style="s2">about the cognitive styles that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.900" end="00:53:06.210" style="s2">important for being wise and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.540" end="00:53:08.280" style="s2">is important sort of a judicial style</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.210" end="00:53:10.320" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s good at making judgments</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.280" end="00:53:11.760" style="s2">the reason why I&#39;m not going into that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.320" end="00:53:14.700" style="s2">detail is that relying on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.760" end="00:53:16.920" style="s2">notions from Sternberg and others about</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.700" end="00:53:18.780" style="s2">particular kinds of styles and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.920" end="00:53:20.790" style="s2">really have time to go into that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.780" end="00:53:22.850" style="s2">depth at that would be a large chunk on</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.790" end="00:53:25.530" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.850" end="00:53:28.980" style="s2">what what what it shows</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.530" end="00:53:31.800" style="s2">what it shows is how important that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.980" end="00:53:34.320" style="s2">the capacity for good judgment is for</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.800" end="00:53:35.940" style="s2">wisdom and we sort of knew that but as</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.320" end="00:53:37.590" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to as I&#39;m trying to argue</p>
