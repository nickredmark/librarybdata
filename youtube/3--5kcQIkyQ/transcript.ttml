<p begin="00:00:05.060" end="00:00:08.370" style="s2">so this is a slightly different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:11.099" style="s2">film where we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.370" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">sense-making the corona virus outbreak</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.099" end="00:00:16.410" style="s2">and things are sort of changing day by</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:19.830" style="s2">day minute by minute and this is a real</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.960" style="s2">sort of task for sense making so in this</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.830" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">we&#39;re going to play a few clips from</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.960" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">different people some people have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:28.380" style="s2">on the channel before some people who</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">are new and looking at sort of the wider</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.380" end="00:00:32.969" style="s2">context the challenges to making sense</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:34.530" style="s2">of it what are the sort of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:37.590" style="s2">fragilities and what are the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.530" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">second-order issues that this is likely</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.590" end="00:00:43.219" style="s2">to throw up I mean it feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">almost certain to stress test our</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.219" end="00:00:47.760" style="s2">societies like the sense-making and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:52.170" style="s2">health care system and all of the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.760" end="00:00:54.530" style="s2">systems as well and this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.170" end="00:00:56.730" style="s2">a live sort of ongoing sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.530" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">exploration so we&#39;re going to obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.730" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">return to this in future days I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">feel a little bit kind of frazzled right</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">now kind of information overload myself</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.150" style="s2">yeah and in these kind of environments I</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.280" style="s2">certainly feel a real sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.150" end="00:01:13.290" style="s2">responsibility around like anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.280" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">sharing information in this time I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.290" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">there&#39;s an extra level of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">and awareness that that certainly I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:23.340" style="s2">and we feel in in doing this because</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">anything that we&#39;re sharing can have</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.340" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">serious consequences and so we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:27.659" style="s2">to be really really careful with what</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">we&#39;re saying what we&#39;re what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.659" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">sharing while at the same trying time to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">hold that the fact that things are</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:37.710" style="s2">uncertain some of the information seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">to contradict itself there are different</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.710" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">perspectives and that we all need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:42.090" style="s2">upregulate</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:43.770" style="s2">and to improve our sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.090" end="00:01:46.939" style="s2">discernment as we as we kind of go</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.770" end="00:01:51.180" style="s2">through this so we have interviews with</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.939" end="00:01:52.950" style="s2">Thomas poyo who wrote an article that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.180" end="00:01:54.750" style="s2">you may have read it it was hugely</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.950" end="00:01:57.329" style="s2">popular it&#39;s been shared over 24 million</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.750" end="00:02:01.079" style="s2">times it&#39;s an amazing piece of work of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.329" end="00:02:02.850" style="s2">about 37 pages and as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.079" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">it&#39;s more complete and more well</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.850" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">researched than anything I&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:09.629" style="s2">the mainstream media and Thomas isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:11.099" style="s2">journalist Thomas&#39;s works in tech so</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.629" end="00:02:12.770" style="s2">this is going to be another factor as we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.099" end="00:02:15.290" style="s2">look at like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.770" end="00:02:17.330" style="s2">where are the if some of the sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.290" end="00:02:19.640" style="s2">making organs are being overwhelmed and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.330" end="00:02:24.980" style="s2">not fit for purpose where are the new</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.640" end="00:02:27.440" style="s2">sense making people and networks coming</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.980" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">from we&#39;re also going to hear from two</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.440" end="00:02:30.830" style="s2">people who&#39;ve been on the channel before</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:33.380" style="s2">Alex Evans who&#39;s a former UK government</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.830" end="00:02:35.510" style="s2">adviser and also the creator of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.380" end="00:02:37.520" style="s2">collective psychology project we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.510" end="00:02:39.050" style="s2">going to hear from Josh fields it was on</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.520" end="00:02:41.720" style="s2">the channel quite recently talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.050" end="00:02:44.240" style="s2">collapse and systems change systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.720" end="00:02:47.210" style="s2">fragility and we&#39;re also going to hear</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.240" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">from Joe Edelman of human systems and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.210" end="00:02:51.350" style="s2">Joe has not been on the channel before</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">but he is in this sort of wider</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.350" end="00:02:56.270" style="s2">sense-making community and is very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.310" style="s2">highly regarded and he&#39;s got a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.270" end="00:02:59.720" style="s2">really interesting stuff to share so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.310" end="00:03:01.310" style="s2">mentioned the word frazzled before and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.720" end="00:03:03.800" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly what I&#39;m feeling right</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.310" end="00:03:05.360" style="s2">now having been delving into lots of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.800" end="00:03:07.400" style="s2">different sources of information and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of other concepts we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.400" end="00:03:10.340" style="s2">talked about in the channel which I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:11.720" style="s2">think are really being tested right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.340" end="00:03:13.670" style="s2">so one of them is sovereignty this</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.720" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">ability to stay connected to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.670" end="00:03:17.870" style="s2">but also be receptive to the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">another is discernment you know this</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.870" end="00:03:21.890" style="s2">huge amount of information and a huge</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.670" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">amount of uncertainty complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.890" end="00:03:24.290" style="s2">chaos really with things changing every</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:25.850" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.290" end="00:03:27.710" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve certainly felt that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.850" end="00:03:29.930" style="s2">myself my both of those things my</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.710" end="00:03:32.300" style="s2">sovereignty my connectedness to myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.930" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">and then also my discernment especially</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.300" end="00:03:36.140" style="s2">this huge almost overwhelm of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:38.210" style="s2">information so that and I&#39;ve also been</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.140" end="00:03:39.950" style="s2">reminded you know I think well firstly I</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.210" end="00:03:41.510" style="s2">think we&#39;re all experiencing that or</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.950" end="00:03:42.740" style="s2">pretty much everyone I&#39;ve spoken to is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.510" end="00:03:44.990" style="s2">experiencing that is something where</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.740" end="00:03:47.900" style="s2">we&#39;re all experiencing kind of at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.990" end="00:03:51.170" style="s2">same time and so this this process of</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.900" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">making sense live feels like important</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.170" end="00:03:54.440" style="s2">but for me also feels like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:57.260" style="s2">only things I feel like I can do right</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.440" end="00:04:01.430" style="s2">now it&#39;s just kind of do the best job I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.260" end="00:04:03.260" style="s2">can and kind of making sense staying as</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.430" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">centered as I can and being as</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.260" end="00:04:07.670" style="s2">discerning as I can as well yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:09.050" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of those times where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.670" end="00:04:11.240" style="s2">can almost feel like the collective</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.050" end="00:04:12.920" style="s2">consciousness like everyone is aware of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.240" end="00:04:14.209" style="s2">this everyone is responding in their own</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.920" end="00:04:15.800" style="s2">ways and just the blizzard of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.209" end="00:04:17.239" style="s2">sense-making as well just things are</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.800" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">changing hour by hour and minute by</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.239" end="00:04:20.510" style="s2">minute and probably even by the time we</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:22.580" style="s2">upload this in a couple of hours time</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:24.140" style="s2">things will have changed so this is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.580" end="00:04:25.670" style="s2">that this is not an attempt to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.140" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">make sense of what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.670" end="00:04:29.090" style="s2">current state of affairs is we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:31.870" style="s2">to direct people to and give some links</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">to people to follow on Twitter and other</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.870" end="00:04:35.450" style="s2">other sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:37.430" style="s2">environments that people can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.450" end="00:04:39.290" style="s2">track that stuff given that this is kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.430" end="00:04:41.990" style="s2">of real-time sense making we would love</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.290" end="00:04:43.640" style="s2">to hear from you guys put any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.990" end="00:04:45.890" style="s2">really well researched or really</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.640" end="00:04:49.790" style="s2">interesting since making resources into</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.890" end="00:04:51.770" style="s2">the comments below we&#39;re also opening up</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.790" end="00:04:55.100" style="s2">a new thread on the discord channel and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.770" end="00:04:56.480" style="s2">we&#39;re looking to to make sense while</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.100" end="00:04:58.010" style="s2">being mindful that we don&#39;t want to take</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.480" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">resources away from people who are doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.010" end="00:05:01.520" style="s2">that well elsewhere so if you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:03.860" style="s2">there are communities that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.520" end="00:05:05.690" style="s2">this well elsewhere please do get in</p>

<p begin="00:05:06.950" end="00:05:10.640" style="s2">something to add to this kind of ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.530" end="00:05:13.610" style="s2">project and we&#39;ll bring that up on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.640" end="00:05:15.590" style="s2">screen now so I&#39;m gonna play part of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.610" end="00:05:17.900" style="s2">interview with Thomas pueyo who wrote</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.590" end="00:05:20.480" style="s2">this incredibly viral article that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.900" end="00:05:23.390" style="s2">been shared over 24 million times in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.480" end="00:05:25.400" style="s2">last few days you wrote an article that</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.390" end="00:05:28.520" style="s2">was incredibly well researched I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.400" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">it was about 39 pages in total that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.520" end="00:05:32.990" style="s2">been very very popular I think I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.890" end="00:05:41.510" style="s2">the main takeaway from that article that</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.780" end="00:05:44.900" style="s2">people need to know the number of cases</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.510" end="00:05:47.180" style="s2">of coroner virus is exploding the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.900" end="00:05:49.720" style="s2">globally people don&#39;t realize that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.180" end="00:05:51.890" style="s2">happening because this is exponential</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.720" end="00:05:56.390" style="s2">which means that at the beginning it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.890" end="00:06:00.050" style="s2">very slow and suddenly it explodes that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.390" end="00:06:01.370" style="s2">is why most countries have not taking</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.050" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">the measures that they needed to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.370" end="00:06:05.080" style="s2">the moment to take the measures it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:08.540" style="s2">when it&#39;s here it&#39;s not only it&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.080" end="00:06:11.090" style="s2">at that point the outbreak has already</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.540" end="00:06:13.550" style="s2">exploded so what you need to show other</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.090" end="00:06:16.460" style="s2">of the article explain what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.550" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">happen which is if you don&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.460" end="00:06:21.710" style="s2">the cases are gonna explode once they</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:24.530" style="s2">explode they&#39;re going to overrun the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.710" end="00:06:27.530" style="s2">healthcare system once they do the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.530" end="00:06:32.300" style="s2">mortality rate of the coroner others</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.530" end="00:06:33.740" style="s2">will explode probably up to 10x 10 times</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.300" end="00:06:36.440" style="s2">higher mortality</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.740" end="00:06:38.120" style="s2">Thomas can I ask your your background</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:39.190" style="s2">because I understand you&#39;re not in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:40.630" style="s2">media or not a journal</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:42.490" style="s2">how long do I have to meet you two right</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.630" end="00:06:46.570" style="s2">and what&#39;s your background for doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.490" end="00:06:49.480" style="s2">this so I had spent before I wrote it I</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.570" end="00:06:53.910" style="s2">had spent around two weeks researching</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.480" end="00:07:00.670" style="s2">this around for four to five hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.910" end="00:07:04.630" style="s2">and I think your underlying question is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.670" end="00:07:06.610" style="s2">why should people listen to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.630" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">think the answer is they shouldn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.610" end="00:07:14.860" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t listen to me I I am NOT going</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:17.530" style="s2">to be down knowledge I just I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.860" end="00:07:19.690" style="s2">biologist what I&#39;ve done is gather all</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.530" end="00:07:22.990" style="s2">the research from all these different</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.690" end="00:07:26.920" style="s2">places and put it in one place so people</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.990" end="00:07:29.710" style="s2">can understand it you should judge the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.920" end="00:07:32.170" style="s2">article based on the data and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.710" end="00:07:35.560" style="s2">arguments and sources not on the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.170" end="00:07:41.740" style="s2">that it&#39;s me it so happens that I have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.560" end="00:07:44.320" style="s2">couple of background elements that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.740" end="00:07:46.090" style="s2">helped me put this together I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.320" end="00:07:48.100" style="s2">engineer I have two masters of science</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.090" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">so I&#39;m very very close to all things</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.100" end="00:07:52.150" style="s2">data and analysis and statistics I</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">worked as a consultant where I had to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.150" end="00:07:54.820" style="s2">get into account in companies and</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:58.320" style="s2">understand them within two to three</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.820" end="00:08:00.250" style="s2">weeks so I&#39;m very I have experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.320" end="00:08:02.890" style="s2">going deep into understanding a problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.250" end="00:08:05.890" style="s2">very very quickly I also created some</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.890" end="00:08:08.500" style="s2">very altercations that exploded to up to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.890" end="00:08:12.640" style="s2">20 million users so I am acquainted with</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.500" end="00:08:14.680" style="s2">the analytics of virality I think these</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.640" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">are some of the reasons why I was able</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.680" end="00:08:19.930" style="s2">to put these two together but people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:21.790" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t see me as the person making</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.930" end="00:08:26.680" style="s2">the arguments but rather making the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.790" end="00:08:28.870" style="s2">Assembly of the arguments and so we talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.680" end="00:08:31.150" style="s2">a lot on on this channel we look very</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.870" end="00:08:33.820" style="s2">closely at sense making what are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.150" end="00:08:36.370" style="s2">failures and sense making and especially</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.820" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">about how do we get better how do we up</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.370" end="00:08:40.840" style="s2">regulate our discernment and our sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:43.390" style="s2">making and it&#39;s really interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:45.550" style="s2">you seem to be doing something that so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.390" end="00:08:50.130" style="s2">far the mainstream media hasn&#39;t done to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.550" end="00:08:50.130" style="s2">that level why do you think that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.150" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">the media and and politicians and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.800" end="00:09:00.770" style="s2">and I care about both but I came more</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:03.650" style="s2">about politicians I think I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.770" end="00:09:06.010" style="s2">the key mental frameworks that most</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.650" end="00:09:09.260" style="s2">people are lack is exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.010" end="00:09:10.850" style="s2">the the my job I didn&#39;t mention that in</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.260" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">but in my job both in the viral</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.850" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">applications but but in tech in general</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:17.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going for exponential growth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:18.589" style="s2">you understand the mechanics of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.060" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">experience for growth so when you see</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.589" end="00:09:23.870" style="s2">that something is growing at 20% or 30%</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:25.700" style="s2">day over day you freak out you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.870" end="00:09:28.130" style="s2">super happy if it&#39;s your product or</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.700" end="00:09:30.170" style="s2">you&#39;re super super super scared if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.130" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">a virus but because you understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.170" end="00:09:34.670" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen in a week two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:35.930" style="s2">three weeks three months four months so</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.670" end="00:09:39.020" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.930" end="00:09:44.210" style="s2">key issues why people didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.020" end="00:09:47.180" style="s2">what was going to happen there&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.210" end="00:09:50.870" style="s2">issue of connecting the dots here</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.180" end="00:09:52.460" style="s2">because it&#39;s not just one part this is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.870" end="00:09:56.660" style="s2">puzzle and you need to put it together</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.460" end="00:09:58.970" style="s2">and most journalists especially when</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.660" end="00:10:00.980" style="s2">they&#39;re covering news they are not</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.970" end="00:10:02.330" style="s2">trained to put all the pieces together</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.980" end="00:10:04.250" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing a lot of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.330" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">fragilities in various different areas</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.250" end="00:10:08.209" style="s2">and one of them is the ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:09.830" style="s2">sense of the crisis and I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.209" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">the things that&#39;s required is for people</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.830" end="00:10:16.010" style="s2">to to improve their discernment to step</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:17.900" style="s2">up and potentially alternatives to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.010" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">of the failing systems are emerging and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.900" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">I would put you in that bracket as</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.230" style="s2">someone who seems to be making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:26.510" style="s2">the outbreak better than most if not all</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.230" end="00:10:30.410" style="s2">in the mainstream media sense that that</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.510" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">people are having to step up here we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.410" end="00:10:34.130" style="s2">in a perfect example of new information</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.180" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">coming to society</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.130" end="00:10:38.839" style="s2">it reminds me for example what happened</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:43.910" style="s2">with uh with drugs heads or the Trump</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.839" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">election in 2016 where it took everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.910" end="00:10:49.820" style="s2">the back nobody knew how to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:51.140" style="s2">that situation right and so suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.820" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">there&#39;s these new information in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.140" end="00:10:57.500" style="s2">system and and and the system just</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:59.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know how to cope with it and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.500" end="00:11:02.450" style="s2">it tries to digest it so the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.390" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">becomes when you have these this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.450" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">happen frequently by the way</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:10.910" style="s2">but but when it happens what is the best</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:12.649" style="s2">process to to process this information</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.910" end="00:11:15.350" style="s2">as quickly as possible and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.649" end="00:11:17.449" style="s2">what is happening today is the right way</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.350" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">to do it yeah this film is not to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.449" end="00:11:21.410" style="s2">concentrate on sort of the logistics of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.809" style="s2">the virus like the transmission rates or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.410" end="00:11:25.639" style="s2">the ways of protecting ourselves and all</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.809" end="00:11:26.629" style="s2">of that that&#39;s really available</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.639" end="00:11:28.639" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.629" end="00:11:30.859" style="s2">I&#39;ve highly recommend the Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.639" end="00:11:32.749" style="s2">podcast and the Sam Harris podcast</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.859" end="00:11:35.689" style="s2">recently with experts in the field and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.749" end="00:11:37.879" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting to see how these</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.689" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">long-form podcasts do feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.879" end="00:11:42.319" style="s2">coming into their own when there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.549" style="s2">there&#39;s a very complex situation I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.319" end="00:11:44.889" style="s2">just add to that as well as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.549" end="00:11:47.509" style="s2">talking about it what strikes me is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.889" end="00:11:49.549" style="s2">another thing that the traditional news</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.509" end="00:11:51.109" style="s2">outlets struggle to do is cooperate in</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.549" end="00:11:52.699" style="s2">the same way that that people are</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.109" end="00:11:54.529" style="s2">cooperating online where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.699" end="00:11:56.569" style="s2">decentralized it&#39;s not a competition</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.529" end="00:11:58.189" style="s2">it&#39;s about people finding and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.569" end="00:12:00.410" style="s2">the best information and that builds on</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.189" end="00:12:02.089" style="s2">itself in a very decentralized way as</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.410" end="00:12:03.799" style="s2">opposed to we&#39;ve got the scoop and we</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.089" end="00:12:05.809" style="s2">better we better hold on to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.799" end="00:12:07.759" style="s2">completely different model we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.809" end="00:12:10.999" style="s2">play a very short clip now from the Sam</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.759" end="00:12:14.299" style="s2">Harris podcast with a mesh adelgid from</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.999" end="00:12:17.660" style="s2">the Johns Hopkins University it&#39;s still</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.660" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">this virus yeah I think it is going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.299" end="00:12:25.790" style="s2">be more than people will imagine but</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:27.529" style="s2">will it be cataclysmic I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.790" end="00:12:29.569" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the case the highest flu</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.529" end="00:12:34.040" style="s2">death rate we have I think outside of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.569" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">pandemic is 80,000 and 2017 to 2018 so</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.040" end="00:12:38.029" style="s2">this is magnitude higher than that and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:40.549" style="s2">do think it&#39;s gonna be disruptive and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.029" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">bad but I think that what I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.549" end="00:12:45.769" style="s2">about is that people&#39;s actions and</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:48.919" style="s2">reactions and and and panic will</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.769" end="00:12:51.110" style="s2">actually make things worse and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.919" end="00:12:53.329" style="s2">really lead to this kind of cascading</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.110" end="00:12:56.089" style="s2">effect where where hospitals can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.329" end="00:12:58.389" style="s2">operate where where there is widespread</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.089" end="00:13:01.069" style="s2">social chaos going on and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.389" end="00:13:03.379" style="s2">what really worries me more than the</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.069" end="00:13:06.230" style="s2">virus itself yeah so that clip really</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.379" end="00:13:07.579" style="s2">leads into what most of the rest of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.230" end="00:13:09.980" style="s2">is going to be about which is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.579" end="00:13:12.499" style="s2">second-order consequences the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.980" end="00:13:16.309" style="s2">fragility and how this might play out</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.499" end="00:13:17.899" style="s2">I&#39;m going to start with the the way that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.309" end="00:13:18.340" style="s2">different countries are responding to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.899" end="00:13:21.010" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.340" end="00:13:22.779" style="s2">in particular the UK seems to be taking</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.010" end="00:13:25.390" style="s2">and again this is changing kind of alibi</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.779" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">our like the UK has has has changed</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.390" end="00:13:31.390" style="s2">position quite significantly even in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">last couple of days even today but the U</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.390" end="00:13:35.620" style="s2">the UK had decided on a very different</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.230" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.620" end="00:13:41.350" style="s2">to many other countries so Italy went</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.230" end="00:13:43.510" style="s2">into lockdown China went into lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.350" end="00:13:44.470" style="s2">but that seems to be what Spain is doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.510" end="00:13:47.890" style="s2">and what most of the other European</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.470" end="00:13:49.720" style="s2">countries are doing the UK decided on a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.890" end="00:13:53.830" style="s2">course of what they&#39;re calling herd</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.720" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">immunity and this is why this is really</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.830" end="00:13:58.570" style="s2">interesting is that the UK one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:00.610" style="s2">most senior advisors in the UK is a guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.570" end="00:14:03.310" style="s2">called Dominic Cummings and Dominic</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.610" end="00:14:06.160" style="s2">Cummings is incredibly well versed in</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.310" end="00:14:08.350" style="s2">complexity theory in some of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.160" end="00:14:10.510" style="s2">topics that we&#39;ve talked about on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.350" end="00:14:13.390" style="s2">channel and a lot of people who are kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.510" end="00:14:15.220" style="s2">of involved in making sense in this sort</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.390" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">of sense making community would be</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.220" end="00:14:19.930" style="s2">worked very well aware of and Cummings</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.920" end="00:14:21.910" style="s2">if you look at his blog he kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.930" end="00:14:23.080" style="s2">details all of these like he&#39;s a first</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.910" end="00:14:24.850" style="s2">principles thinker</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.080" end="00:14:25.990" style="s2">he&#39;s very allergic to doing what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.850" end="00:14:29.170" style="s2">everyone else is doing he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.990" end="00:14:31.300" style="s2">allergic to the status quo and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.170" end="00:14:32.950" style="s2">interesting that he&#39;s chosen or we</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.300" end="00:14:35.410" style="s2">assume that he&#39;s heavily involved in</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.950" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">this decision by the UK government to</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.410" end="00:14:38.440" style="s2">the nature of the British political</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.290" style="s2">system if you&#39;re kind of watching from</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.440" end="00:14:44.920" style="s2">from the US when is much more</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.290" end="00:14:47.110" style="s2">centralized than the US and power is</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.920" end="00:14:49.300" style="s2">very concentrated on the prime minister</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.110" end="00:14:51.430" style="s2">and very concentrated in the Prime</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.300" end="00:14:55.570" style="s2">Minister&#39;s advisor in this case he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.430" end="00:14:57.580" style="s2">very very powerful in the UK and despite</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.570" end="00:14:59.650" style="s2">the huge pressure to change course at</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.580" end="00:15:01.750" style="s2">the moment the UK looks to be taking a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.650" end="00:15:03.940" style="s2">different step and I talked to Alex</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.750" end="00:15:05.800" style="s2">Evans who as I said he used to work in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.940" end="00:15:07.870" style="s2">the British government about this and</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.800" end="00:15:10.660" style="s2">also Josh fields they&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.870" end="00:15:12.339" style="s2">something called herd immunity they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.660" end="00:15:15.250" style="s2">assuming that most people will get the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.339" end="00:15:20.050" style="s2">virus so they&#39;re wanting to to manage</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.250" end="00:15:21.700" style="s2">the numbers and and once once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.050" end="00:15:23.620" style="s2">calculating that 60 percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.700" end="00:15:26.830" style="s2">have developed immunity then there will</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.620" end="00:15:32.019" style="s2">be some immunity in the population but I</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:34.839" style="s2">think that also depends on one key</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.019" end="00:15:37.089" style="s2">unknown or that maybe unknown is whether</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.839" end="00:15:39.610" style="s2">immunity develops and if immunity</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.089" end="00:15:41.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t develop then that&#39;s a not only a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.610" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">high-risk strategy it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.290" end="00:15:45.489" style="s2">potentially a really suicidal strategy</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:48.220" style="s2">yeah so let me just dump out a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.489" end="00:15:49.899" style="s2">bit Harrod immunity is really the you</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.220" end="00:15:51.610" style="s2">kid this is the second principle of why</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.899" end="00:15:53.619" style="s2">UK government policy is different</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.610" end="00:15:56.529" style="s2">Harrod immunity is basically saying look</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.619" end="00:15:58.989" style="s2">people are gonna get the virus anyway we</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.529" end="00:16:03.579" style="s2">should let people get said virus but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.989" end="00:16:07.149" style="s2">ensure that it is mainly law grasp risk</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.579" end="00:16:09.670" style="s2">groups law risk categories who end up</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.149" end="00:16:12.459" style="s2">getting the virus and what will this do</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.670" end="00:16:15.730" style="s2">well the idea hypothesis is they get the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.459" end="00:16:17.649" style="s2">virus they recover from the virus and in</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.730" end="00:16:18.970" style="s2">so doing they actually build immunity to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.649" end="00:16:22.809" style="s2">the virus and so they don&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.970" end="00:16:25.869" style="s2">future carriers of said virus now why</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.809" end="00:16:27.399" style="s2">might this be a wise strategy because in</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.869" end="00:16:28.869" style="s2">other words it&#39;s basically saying let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.399" end="00:16:32.699" style="s2">give more of the population in this</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.869" end="00:16:35.079" style="s2">infection right why might this be wise I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.699" end="00:16:37.179" style="s2">think part of the thinking behind is if</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.079" end="00:16:39.220" style="s2">you go to China or Italy people are in</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.179" end="00:16:41.470" style="s2">quarantine these people aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.220" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">building immunity right because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.470" end="00:16:43.959" style="s2">not a lot of them are not actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:46.660" style="s2">picking up the virus it&#39;s just a self</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.959" end="00:16:49.089" style="s2">self as a it&#39;s a precautious measure to</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.660" end="00:16:51.910" style="s2">stop the spread know if the virus is is</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.089" end="00:16:52.929" style="s2">doubling in size every four days in</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.910" end="00:16:55.569" style="s2">terms of the number of people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.929" end="00:16:58.269" style="s2">affecting that quarantine is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.569" end="00:17:00.309" style="s2">excellent way to stop that spread but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.269" end="00:17:02.589" style="s2">doesn&#39;t do much for future immunity and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.309" end="00:17:05.620" style="s2">so I think part of the rationale behind</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.589" end="00:17:07.870" style="s2">this is if you give Loras groups more of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.620" end="00:17:11.529" style="s2">the infection we build the immunity over</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.870" end="00:17:13.299" style="s2">time and so we won&#39;t need interventions</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.529" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">like quarantine six twelve months in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.299" end="00:17:16.449" style="s2">future and China and Italy</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:18.069" style="s2">what happens if everybody starts to come</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.449" end="00:17:19.569" style="s2">out on the streets again and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.069" end="00:17:21.399" style="s2">suddenly there&#39;s another via there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.569" end="00:17:23.110" style="s2">another outbreak of the virus they have</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.399" end="00:17:24.819" style="s2">to go back to the quarantine whereas if</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.110" end="00:17:27.250" style="s2">our population become could become more</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.819" end="00:17:30.730" style="s2">resistant that could be hypothetically a</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.250" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">good thing no this is extremely this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.730" end="00:17:35.049" style="s2">a high-risk high-reward strategy because</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:37.840" style="s2">what it basically confers Azur suggests</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.049" end="00:17:39.970" style="s2">is we can actually build 30-minute herd</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.840" end="00:17:41.500" style="s2">immunity right i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.970" end="00:17:43.149" style="s2">problematic for two reasons the first</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.500" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">there is absolutely fuck-all evidence</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.149" end="00:17:45.760" style="s2">that we can there is an implicit</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:47.260" style="s2">assumption from</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.760" end="00:17:49.540" style="s2">biologist this is what tends to happen</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.260" end="00:17:52.350" style="s2">and which by the way I&#39;d really like to</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.540" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">see open sourced we&#39;re basing our</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.350" end="00:17:57.820" style="s2">surrender to Herod immunity on models we</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:18:01.900" style="s2">don&#39;t understand or have not seen but</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.820" end="00:18:05.580" style="s2">the second is the presupposition that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.900" end="00:18:08.950" style="s2">can actually build build immunity so is</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.580" end="00:18:10.900" style="s2">really said suggests or hopes that our</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.950" end="00:18:14.890" style="s2">immune systems are strong enough to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.900" end="00:18:16.810" style="s2">that but our local our our modern world</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.890" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">with toxins and pollution and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.810" end="00:18:20.860" style="s2">we eat suggests that immune systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:23.860" style="s2">aren&#39;t quite now what the or they once</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.860" end="00:18:25.390" style="s2">were and so it&#39;s a big risk it&#39;s a hell</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.860" end="00:18:29.170" style="s2">of a big risk and I&#39;d love to see things</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.390" end="00:18:31.630" style="s2">open sourced to really know why the</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.170" end="00:18:34.390" style="s2">rationale for this but just such a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.630" end="00:18:36.100" style="s2">just to give a summary then the U key is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.390" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">different in two ways we&#39;re noting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.100" end="00:18:40.420" style="s2">not encouraging social social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:43.450" style="s2">because of behavioral psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.420" end="00:18:45.670" style="s2">because of herd immunity both of those</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.450" end="00:18:48.190" style="s2">things are I on two major asam two major</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.670" end="00:18:51.400" style="s2">assumptions one is capacity to predict</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.190" end="00:18:54.430" style="s2">and the capacity to build immunity I</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.400" end="00:18:56.200" style="s2">think we need to see more evidence as to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.430" end="00:19:00.640" style="s2">why those are fear clear assumptions to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.200" end="00:19:03.130" style="s2">make yeah and it&#39;s interesting there was</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.640" end="00:19:05.230" style="s2">a letter today or a series of letters to</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.130" end="00:19:07.900" style="s2">the times from very senior medical</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:09.550" style="s2">people making exactly those points that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.900" end="00:19:12.010" style="s2">we need to see the models we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.550" end="00:19:14.860" style="s2">understand why the government is taking</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.010" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">these decisions and while I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.860" end="00:19:19.840" style="s2">you I also wonder if there&#39;s a second</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:23.050" style="s2">factor involved or another factor</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.840" end="00:19:24.850" style="s2">involved which is that we&#39;re very we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.050" end="00:19:27.340" style="s2">not very good at talking about risk</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.850" end="00:19:32.260" style="s2">especially in the media the media is</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.340" end="00:19:34.570" style="s2">generally very good at to sell papers</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.260" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">that sort of over at overstating risks</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.570" end="00:19:40.840" style="s2">so I think the reason they haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.760" end="00:19:41.950" style="s2">this so far is that once you start once</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.840" end="00:19:44.530" style="s2">you start having a really honest</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.950" end="00:19:46.030" style="s2">conversation about the UK strategy the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.530" end="00:19:48.280" style="s2">next question that will come back from</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.030" end="00:19:49.900" style="s2">journalists is so are you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.280" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">you&#39;re basically encouraging people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.900" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">get the virus are you saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:58.660" style="s2">are going to wilfully allow people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.620" style="s2">die because of this virus and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.660" end="00:20:02.020" style="s2">to those is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.620" end="00:20:04.840" style="s2">because that is the strategy that the UK</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.020" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">is has chosen but that&#39;s not a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.840" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">that can be reported well in the media</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:12.850" style="s2">you can see the headlines now governor</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:15.520" style="s2">says people must die so that is I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.850" end="00:20:17.920" style="s2">another failure condition of this of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.520" end="00:20:19.480" style="s2">response to the virus is that with we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.920" end="00:20:21.610" style="s2">terrible at understanding and talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.480" end="00:20:24.220" style="s2">about risk and we&#39;re terrible about</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.610" end="00:20:26.680" style="s2">being able to communicate that without</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.220" end="00:20:28.660" style="s2">scare mongering and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.680" end="00:20:30.940" style="s2">another systemic fragility that I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.660" end="00:20:34.059" style="s2">is being shown up with the with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.940" end="00:20:36.340" style="s2">going on at the moment one one if if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.059" end="00:20:38.710" style="s2">were to speak in really crude terms as</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.340" end="00:20:42.580" style="s2">to what parrot immunity actually means</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.710" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">in practice it&#39;s really us taking age or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.580" end="00:20:47.050" style="s2">the government taking agency or bruh how</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:48.220" style="s2">much it Thai treats the virus if</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.050" end="00:20:50.080" style="s2">instantly says we&#39;re gonna load the</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.220" end="00:20:53.350" style="s2">virus get to the Symone when we think</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.080" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">it&#39;s reached our our peak ie when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.350" end="00:20:58.690" style="s2">think our health care resources can no</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:00.460" style="s2">longer handle more we will titrate it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.690" end="00:21:02.770" style="s2">and we&#39;ll close schools and we&#39;ll lead</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.460" end="00:21:04.240" style="s2">to social isolation but really if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.770" end="00:21:06.429" style="s2">can read between the lines of what that</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.240" end="00:21:07.960" style="s2">means it is really saying like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.429" end="00:21:09.309" style="s2">gonna load there to know now we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.960" end="00:21:10.540" style="s2">stop death we&#39;re gonna load death no</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.309" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna stop death and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.540" end="00:21:16.210" style="s2">is yeah I&#39;m politically unfeasible on</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:17.950" style="s2">the media aspect um I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.210" end="00:21:20.050" style="s2">that it becomes difficult for the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.950" end="00:21:21.850" style="s2">government to be upfront about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.050" end="00:21:23.620" style="s2">dilemmas and trade-offs that any</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.850" end="00:21:26.200" style="s2">government has to navigate in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.620" end="00:21:28.090" style="s2">of an issue because as you say the media</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.200" end="00:21:28.660" style="s2">will often you know go into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.090" end="00:21:31.000" style="s2">gotcha</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.660" end="00:21:32.260" style="s2">mode and aim to kind of embarrass the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.000" end="00:21:34.090" style="s2">government or go for the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.260" end="00:21:36.610" style="s2">sensational angle possible I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.090" end="00:21:38.920" style="s2">not unlike the Facebook algorithm which</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.610" end="00:21:42.010" style="s2">will push content at us that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.920" end="00:21:43.240" style="s2">triggering or outraging or scary content</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.010" end="00:21:45.309" style="s2">because they know that that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.240" end="00:21:47.230" style="s2">effective way of monetizing our</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.309" end="00:21:50.679" style="s2">attention and of course the media have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.230" end="00:21:52.360" style="s2">many of the same incentives in place so</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.679" end="00:21:53.740" style="s2">I mean I think that you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.360" end="00:21:55.570" style="s2">interesting things in all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.740" end="00:21:57.790" style="s2">that you know we are all speculating</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.570" end="00:22:00.130" style="s2">about what is the top-down strategy from</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.790" end="00:22:01.390" style="s2">government here but also if we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.130" end="00:22:03.550" style="s2">the things that are if you like within</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.390" end="00:22:04.900" style="s2">our own circle of control there is this</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.550" end="00:22:07.750" style="s2">whole other aspect which is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.900" end="00:22:09.970" style="s2">bottom-up response to it which is both</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.750" end="00:22:11.770" style="s2">about people&#39;s own decisions in their</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.970" end="00:22:14.320" style="s2">everyday lives whether they observe</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.770" end="00:22:16.120" style="s2">social distancing protocol</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.320" end="00:22:18.370" style="s2">or just assumed well I&#39;ll be fine it</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.120" end="00:22:20.170" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if I get it whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.370" end="00:22:22.170" style="s2">they&#39;re engaging in panic buying or</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.170" end="00:22:24.520" style="s2">leaving goods for others and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.170" end="00:22:26.080" style="s2">so there&#39;s that aspect and also I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.520" end="00:22:28.270" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing this weekend in particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.080" end="00:22:31.330" style="s2">a huge amount of self organizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.270" end="00:22:33.970" style="s2">happening in communities to build Street</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.330" end="00:22:35.740" style="s2">and neighborhood level resilience in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.970" end="00:22:37.260" style="s2">way that&#39;s really encouraging and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.740" end="00:22:39.550" style="s2">think you know however it plays out</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.260" end="00:22:41.290" style="s2">however the government&#39;s strategy pans</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.550" end="00:22:43.090" style="s2">out over time this is stuff that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.290" end="00:22:44.920" style="s2">only be a good thing so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.090" end="00:22:47.830" style="s2">if you like two sides to the resilient</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.920" end="00:22:49.780" style="s2">story here I just wanted to recap the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.830" end="00:22:52.540" style="s2">proviso in that because it is really</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.780" end="00:22:54.490" style="s2">really important that the assumption of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.540" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">the herd immunity strategy like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.490" end="00:22:58.540" style="s2">not advocating one way or another we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">trying to make sense of different</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.540" end="00:23:02.650" style="s2">conflicting narratives and conflicting</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">perspectives without trying to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.650" end="00:23:08.470" style="s2">into any one of them but the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:10.150" style="s2">important thing here is that the British</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.470" end="00:23:12.520" style="s2">government&#39;s assumption about herd</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.150" end="00:23:13.900" style="s2">immunity relies on the fact that once</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.520" end="00:23:17.230" style="s2">someone has had the virus they develop</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.900" end="00:23:19.780" style="s2">immunity and that is an assumption and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.230" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">if that&#39;s not the case then what the UK</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.780" end="00:23:24.040" style="s2">is thinking of doing becomes infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.900" style="s2">more dangerous in fact very very</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.040" end="00:23:27.340" style="s2">dangerous so I just want to kind of put</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.900" end="00:23:29.230" style="s2">a flag in that that&#39;s something you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.340" end="00:23:31.780" style="s2">we need to watch out for and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.230" end="00:23:35.650" style="s2">more information onto whether that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.780" end="00:23:38.170" style="s2">case and the other thing that it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.650" end="00:23:42.150" style="s2">flagging up again was mentioned in those</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.170" end="00:23:44.410" style="s2">clips is this is really challenging to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.150" end="00:23:46.210" style="s2">mainstream media sense making because</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.410" end="00:23:50.160" style="s2">we&#39;re it&#39;s very very difficult to talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.210" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">about risk in a sane sensible way when</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.160" end="00:23:55.210" style="s2">sensationalism rules and you can just</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.590" style="s2">see that the questions that would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.210" end="00:23:59.920" style="s2">asked at the press conference is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.590" end="00:24:01.780" style="s2">potential newspaper headlines where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.920" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">question is okay you&#39;re pursuing a herd</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.780" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">immunity strategy mr. Boris Johnson so</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:08.920" style="s2">are you saying that you want people to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.970" end="00:24:11.050" style="s2">get the virus are you saying that people</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.920" end="00:24:14.050" style="s2">that you are going to pursue a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.050" end="00:24:16.060" style="s2">that means more people will die and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.050" end="00:24:17.860" style="s2">you end up with potentially newspaper</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.060" end="00:24:19.720" style="s2">headlines that say government kills the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.860" end="00:24:22.600" style="s2">elderly or something like that because</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.720" end="00:24:24.840" style="s2">we can&#39;t talk about systemic risk we</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.600" end="00:24:26.919" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about the balance of risks</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.840" end="00:24:28.779" style="s2">sensibly in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.919" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">sensationalist media environment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.779" end="00:24:32.259" style="s2">that&#39;s another of the sort of systemic</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:34.359" style="s2">fragilities that we&#39;re seeing being kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.259" end="00:24:35.710" style="s2">of flagged up here and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.359" end="00:24:36.279" style="s2">that I also talked about with some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.710" end="00:24:38.590" style="s2">the interviewees</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.279" end="00:24:40.239" style="s2">you&#39;ve just put out a piece called the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.590" end="00:24:43.779" style="s2">corona crisis and designing better</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.239" end="00:24:47.470" style="s2">social systems and you say right at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.779" end="00:24:49.239" style="s2">beginning of it that this corona crisis</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.470" end="00:24:50.409" style="s2">only an economic crash connected to it</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.239" end="00:24:52.330" style="s2">reveals yet again how Western</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.330" end="00:24:56.830" style="s2">failing you want to expand on that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.759" end="00:24:59.830" style="s2">are you seeing already that has led you</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.830" end="00:25:03.399" style="s2">to conclude that yeah sure I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.830" end="00:25:05.289" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a lot so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.399" end="00:25:08.859" style="s2">that&#39;s failing is the media and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.289" end="00:25:10.739" style="s2">general there&#39;s a feeling that the US</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.859" end="00:25:12.899" style="s2">and the UK have suffered a kind of decay</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.739" end="00:25:15.190" style="s2">where people trust the government less</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.899" end="00:25:18.039" style="s2">than they used to where the government</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.190" end="00:25:21.519" style="s2">kind of deserves less trust than it used</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.039" end="00:25:22.799" style="s2">to deserve for a few of us that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.519" end="00:25:24.909" style="s2">following the right accounts on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.799" end="00:25:27.220" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually been in a better position</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.909" end="00:25:29.830" style="s2">to make sense of the crisis but at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.220" end="00:25:34.359" style="s2">same time there&#39;s massive misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.830" end="00:25:37.210" style="s2">and confusion going on very little</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.359" end="00:25:39.700" style="s2">ability to cohere around that if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.210" end="00:25:41.440" style="s2">look at what&#39;s trending and the tweets</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.700" end="00:25:44.169" style="s2">that are going the most viral these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.440" end="00:25:48.519" style="s2">not actually the ones that have the best</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.169" end="00:25:50.320" style="s2">information content so we see breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.519" end="00:25:52.210" style="s2">in media we see a breakdown in political</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.320" end="00:25:54.100" style="s2">systems what do you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.210" end="00:25:57.460" style="s2">crisis in sense making that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.100" end="00:25:59.169" style="s2">now so I&#39;ve been writing about this for</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.460" end="00:26:01.809" style="s2">a couple of years been thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.169" end="00:26:03.970" style="s2">a hail of the law and when we think</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.809" end="00:26:06.249" style="s2">about sense making think about it in two</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.970" end="00:26:09.399" style="s2">ways the first is the information that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.249" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">is coming into our environment from our</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.399" end="00:26:13.359" style="s2">environment and also our capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:15.100" style="s2">discern that information from that</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.359" end="00:26:18.779" style="s2">environment and so if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.100" end="00:26:21.970" style="s2">first one this exponential increase in</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.779" end="00:26:24.429" style="s2">misinformation this information in fake</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.970" end="00:26:26.499" style="s2">news means that as sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.429" end="00:26:29.799" style="s2">organisms we&#39;re struggling to actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.499" end="00:26:32.529" style="s2">know what what information we can</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.799" end="00:26:33.940" style="s2">actually trust okay and so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.529" end="00:26:35.619" style="s2">if you&#39;ve seen with this coronavirus</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.940" end="00:26:37.299" style="s2">stuff you&#39;ve got the happy Debbie&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.619" end="00:26:38.859" style="s2">one side good basically going this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.299" end="00:26:39.999" style="s2">all some sort of conspiracy theory by</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.859" end="00:26:40.610" style="s2">the government and it&#39;s all about love</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.999" end="00:26:42.860" style="s2">and if your</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.610" end="00:26:45.770" style="s2">panicking your your lower chakra energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.860" end="00:26:50.530" style="s2">is wherever they want to say and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.770" end="00:26:53.960" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a bolts most likely</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.530" end="00:26:59.150" style="s2">disseminating bad information in order</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.960" end="00:27:01.790" style="s2">to increase systemic instability and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.150" end="00:27:04.100" style="s2">the information ecology is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.790" end="00:27:07.490" style="s2">mess it&#39;s it&#39;s a mess and so if</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.100" end="00:27:09.530" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to actually get behind a</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.490" end="00:27:11.030" style="s2">consistent narrative as to what to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.530" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">and they&#39;re all these competing claims</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.030" end="00:27:13.970" style="s2">in social media</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:17.809" style="s2">it becomes hell of a hard to sense make</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.970" end="00:27:20.120" style="s2">I think part of that is linked to we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.809" end="00:27:23.470" style="s2">lost trust in our institutions we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.120" end="00:27:29.179" style="s2">lost trust in our em epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.470" end="00:27:30.940" style="s2">authorities and that&#39;s problematic if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.179" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">want to create a coherent cohesive</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.940" end="00:27:35.090" style="s2">response the other problem is and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:37.100" style="s2">is going to go to the second point which</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.090" end="00:27:39.500" style="s2">is our ability to actually take in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.100" end="00:27:42.380" style="s2">information because we&#39;re so overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.500" end="00:27:44.450" style="s2">with anxiety and mental health issues</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.380" end="00:27:46.970" style="s2">because our concentration capacities are</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.450" end="00:27:48.980" style="s2">actually decreasing our ability to make</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.970" end="00:27:50.600" style="s2">discerning and sovereign decisions about</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.980" end="00:27:53.390" style="s2">what is good information and what is bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.600" end="00:27:55.220" style="s2">information is also compromised so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.390" end="00:27:57.620" style="s2">have this juxtaposition of shifty</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.220" end="00:28:00.590" style="s2">information and shetty capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.620" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">handle that information in the presence</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.590" end="00:28:06.440" style="s2">of exponential complexity it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:08.150" style="s2">highly problematic and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.440" end="00:28:10.460" style="s2">the issue with that man yes there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.150" end="00:28:12.860" style="s2">epistemological crisis because we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.460" end="00:28:15.110" style="s2">trusting I think part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.860" end="00:28:18.710" style="s2">we&#39;re not trusting is because this lack</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.110" end="00:28:20.960" style="s2">of trust that&#39;s disseminating right</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.710" end="00:28:22.490" style="s2">but why how did we get to a position of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.960" end="00:28:26.210" style="s2">a lack of truth in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.490" end="00:28:29.150" style="s2">and I think part of it is we in the West</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.210" end="00:28:32.450" style="s2">the the the Herald&#39;s and this and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.150" end="00:28:34.429" style="s2">creators of the cultures of science and</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.450" end="00:28:38.990" style="s2">technology and engineering ie</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.429" end="00:28:41.390" style="s2">truth based paradigms we ourselves have</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.990" end="00:28:43.370" style="s2">actually taken on more a face over truth</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.390" end="00:28:48.049" style="s2">culture than a truth over face culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.370" end="00:28:50.660" style="s2">and so this we&#39;ve normalized deceit in</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.049" end="00:28:52.250" style="s2">our culture but because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.660" end="00:28:53.539" style="s2">normalized people don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.250" end="00:28:55.820" style="s2">actually a problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.539" end="00:28:58.279" style="s2">you had exponential technology to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.820" end="00:29:00.169" style="s2">cultural adaptation of the seal the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.279" end="00:29:01.759" style="s2">truth I in that cultural adaptation a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.169" end="00:29:04.789" style="s2">little bit more just what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.759" end="00:29:07.059" style="s2">that face over truth yeah so when when</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.789" end="00:29:11.080" style="s2">you look at em a lot of Asian cultures</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.059" end="00:29:15.169" style="s2">Asian cultures tend to put their</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.080" end="00:29:18.070" style="s2">family&#39;s reputation or their their and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.169" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">their external projection to the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.070" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">over and above what is actually true so</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">a lot of people have summarized this as</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:28.849" style="s2">Western culture is more of a guilt based</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:32.119" style="s2">culture and Eastern culture and more of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.849" end="00:29:34.039" style="s2">a shame based culture in the social</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.119" end="00:29:37.070" style="s2">shame or what people think of you is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.039" end="00:29:39.049" style="s2">primary driver of behavior in the eat in</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.070" end="00:29:44.590" style="s2">the East there on the west it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.049" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">individual conscience and your own yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.590" end="00:29:49.129" style="s2">being able to square your own actions</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:50.690" style="s2">with your own in a truth and and more of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.129" end="00:29:52.669" style="s2">the Christian tradition is more on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.690" end="00:29:53.989" style="s2">individual and that what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.669" end="00:29:55.639" style="s2">and I think I&#39;ve heard a few other</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.989" end="00:29:58.489" style="s2">people say as well as like in the social</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.639" end="00:29:59.929" style="s2">media age and in the in the the</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.489" end="00:30:03.109" style="s2">environment that we&#39;ve created for</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.929" end="00:30:05.059" style="s2">ourselves now it&#39;s much more in the West</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.109" end="00:30:06.529" style="s2">about what where people think of</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.059" end="00:30:10.580" style="s2">ourselves and less about the actual</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.529" end="00:30:11.749" style="s2">behavior yeah we&#39;ve I think the point</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.580" end="00:30:15.139" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to make here is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.749" end="00:30:18.129" style="s2">we&#39;ve created the cult rule for that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.139" end="00:30:22.129" style="s2">we&#39;ve created the cultural container</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.129" end="00:30:25.609" style="s2">that is just right for misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.129" end="00:30:27.979" style="s2">disinformation and fake news because our</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.609" end="00:30:30.919" style="s2">culture doesn&#39;t actually no longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.979" end="00:30:33.590" style="s2">actually holds truths to be one of its</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.919" end="00:30:35.629" style="s2">highest virtues or values instead it</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.590" end="00:30:37.340" style="s2">holds that this kind of like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.629" end="00:30:41.179" style="s2">narcissistic co-optation</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.340" end="00:30:42.979" style="s2">and more to be more significant and more</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.179" end="00:30:45.349" style="s2">important and then we have the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.979" end="00:30:47.239" style="s2">systemic fragility I think we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.349" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">realizing that there&#39;s going to be many</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.239" end="00:30:51.289" style="s2">second and third-order consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.789" style="s2">this as it kind of cascades through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.289" end="00:30:56.090" style="s2">system and that&#39;s something that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.789" end="00:30:59.690" style="s2">talked to both Josh and to Joe about how</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.090" end="00:31:02.210" style="s2">do you see this playing out sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.690" end="00:31:05.070" style="s2">the in the I guess medium term in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.210" end="00:31:08.109" style="s2">of the systemic fragilities</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.070" end="00:31:11.669" style="s2">hmmm I mean I think we&#39;re we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.109" end="00:31:15.489" style="s2">in for a pretty bad economic downturn</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.669" end="00:31:18.129" style="s2">and I think what&#39;s happening is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.489" end="00:31:23.830" style="s2">actually very promising promising and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.129" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">exciting we&#39;re seeing a deal Ajith</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.830" end="00:31:28.809" style="s2">imitation of certain ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:31.059" style="s2">things and then a possible legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.809" end="00:31:33.309" style="s2">itemization of other newer ways of doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.059" end="00:31:35.409" style="s2">things and I think this is how political</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.309" end="00:31:37.029" style="s2">change happens more generally like if we</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.409" end="00:31:40.089" style="s2">look at transitions from monarchies to</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.029" end="00:31:42.330" style="s2">representative democracies it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.089" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">assumed that there&#39;s some kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.330" end="00:31:45.789" style="s2">revolution and this is the main moment</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:47.589" style="s2">that it happens but if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.789" end="00:31:49.210" style="s2">American Revolution for instance the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.589" end="00:31:50.259" style="s2">people that kind of took over during the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.210" end="00:31:52.029" style="s2">American Revolution were actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.259" end="00:31:53.799" style="s2">already running things in the colonies</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.029" end="00:31:56.649" style="s2">and they had a different way of</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.799" end="00:32:00.149" style="s2">operating citizens assemblies and things</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.649" end="00:32:04.869" style="s2">like that so they had they developed</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.149" end="00:32:07.139" style="s2">legitimacy under the radar below the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.869" end="00:32:09.940" style="s2">level of the monarchy and the official</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.139" end="00:32:11.499" style="s2">representatives of the King and so by</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.940" end="00:32:12.909" style="s2">the time they wanted to have an American</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.499" end="00:32:17.759" style="s2">Revolution they&#39;d kind of proven</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.909" end="00:32:19.719" style="s2">themselves as a new way of operating and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.759" end="00:32:22.899" style="s2">improving themselves in a series of</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.719" end="00:32:25.029" style="s2">crises before the kind of big crisis at</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.899" end="00:32:27.339" style="s2">the American Revolution and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.029" end="00:32:28.839" style="s2">is how this is the more more common way</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.339" end="00:32:32.429" style="s2">that political change happens and we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.839" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">see it happening right now as the CDC</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.429" end="00:32:37.479" style="s2">you know some governmental actors become</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:39.070" style="s2">dita legitimize the way that they do</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.479" end="00:32:43.059" style="s2">things clearly isn&#39;t working for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.070" end="00:32:46.509" style="s2">people and new actors that maybe have no</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.059" end="00:32:51.989" style="s2">relationship to government are looking</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.509" end="00:32:55.929" style="s2">very responsible and very capable and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.989" end="00:32:57.879" style="s2">think what we need to do right now is we</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.929" end="00:33:04.139" style="s2">need to do our best to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.879" end="00:33:07.629" style="s2">the capable looking actors are also</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.139" end="00:33:09.159" style="s2">promising in terms of new social</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.629" end="00:33:12.339" style="s2">mechanisms in terms of new political</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.159" end="00:33:14.919" style="s2">mechanisms we wouldn&#39;t want this to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.339" end="00:33:18.730" style="s2">into a moment where we develop a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.919" end="00:33:21.460" style="s2">authoritarian or even fascist</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.730" end="00:33:26.250" style="s2">existent because that works we we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.460" end="00:33:30.780" style="s2">to make sure that we have some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.250" end="00:33:35.410" style="s2">hopefully sort of quasi democratic</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.780" end="00:33:38.110" style="s2">optimistic new systems that are seen to</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.410" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">be performing well in the crisis and are</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.110" end="00:33:45.850" style="s2">you seeing anything any sort of real</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:47.530" style="s2">world networks or projects that are kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.850" end="00:33:49.060" style="s2">of that are happening now that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.530" end="00:33:55.800" style="s2">giving you hope or that you&#39;re paying</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.060" end="00:34:03.130" style="s2">attention to yes absolutely I think I</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.800" end="00:34:07.270" style="s2">see many communities I see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.130" end="00:34:09.250" style="s2">a kind of a techno hippie scene which i</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.270" end="00:34:12.700" style="s2">think is doing great work it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.250" end="00:34:16.660" style="s2">like the Burning Man kind of that area I</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.700" end="00:34:19.060" style="s2">see a lot of really talented nerdy</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.660" end="00:34:22.060" style="s2">people also the rationalists the</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.060" end="00:34:26.560" style="s2">effective altruists these people seem to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.060" end="00:34:30.490" style="s2">be responding rapidly organizing doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.560" end="00:34:34.500" style="s2">better than the meta modernists better</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.490" end="00:34:37.840" style="s2">than a lot of the political theorists I</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.500" end="00:34:41.590" style="s2">think what&#39;s one kind of group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.840" end="00:34:43.930" style="s2">shining right now is the kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.590" end="00:34:48.610" style="s2">who have 60 meetups around the world</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.930" end="00:34:51.000" style="s2">like this kind of group and it may be</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.610" end="00:34:55.300" style="s2">that they&#39;ve been doing I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.000" end="00:34:58.090" style="s2">circling or yeah I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.300" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">responsible charity stuff in the past</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.090" end="00:35:04.210" style="s2">but now they&#39;re ready to coordinate and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:07.750" style="s2">do something more immediate more useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.210" end="00:35:10.180" style="s2">so I think I think we&#39;re seeing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.750" end="00:35:12.730" style="s2">these kinds of global community global</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.180" end="00:35:14.380" style="s2">glocal communities are having a moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.730" end="00:35:16.660" style="s2">to shine I think we all have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.380" end="00:35:18.550" style="s2">that there&#39;s going to be huge unintended</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.660" end="00:35:21.730" style="s2">consequences coming out of this that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.550" end="00:35:25.030" style="s2">we&#39;re not really aware of yet I was with</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.730" end="00:35:27.640" style="s2">a family member yesterday who is in</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.030" end="00:35:31.180" style="s2">recovery from alcoholism and I was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.640" end="00:35:32.440" style="s2">thinking this person has a Hugh has</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.180" end="00:35:36.099" style="s2">quite a lot of so</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.440" end="00:35:38.470" style="s2">all events that they&#39;re going to they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.099" end="00:35:40.839" style="s2">involved in going to recovery meetings</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.470" end="00:35:42.609" style="s2">if those sort of things shut down like</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.839" end="00:35:45.400" style="s2">these unintended consequences I know</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.609" end="00:35:47.619" style="s2">that this person will relapse for</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.400" end="00:35:51.490" style="s2">example then we&#39;ve got people who and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.619" end="00:35:54.940" style="s2">like and we know for example that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.490" end="00:35:56.920" style="s2">such social creatures that we need we</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.940" end="00:35:59.170" style="s2">actually need human connection like</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.920" end="00:36:02.530" style="s2">social isolation is an actual torture</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.170" end="00:36:06.150" style="s2">Sarris individual isolation in well they</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.530" end="00:36:08.980" style="s2">call it in jail not social isolation</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.150" end="00:36:11.230" style="s2">confinement so we know that solitary</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.980" end="00:36:12.819" style="s2">confinement in jail is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.230" end="00:36:15.520" style="s2">torture because we are the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.819" end="00:36:19.300" style="s2">creatures that need to meet to connect</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.520" end="00:36:21.460" style="s2">to align our stories to and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.300" end="00:36:23.980" style="s2">if we don&#39;t do that we we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.460" end="00:36:26.380" style="s2">atrophy so are you worried about what</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.980" end="00:36:28.329" style="s2">that might mean sort of longer term or</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.380" end="00:36:30.099" style="s2">medium term yeah I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.329" end="00:36:32.290" style="s2">absolutely right the data shows that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.099" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">loneliness is actually as bad for life</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.290" end="00:36:37.810" style="s2">expectancy as smoking 15 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:38.859" style="s2">cigarettes a day and I think as you say</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.810" end="00:36:41.470" style="s2">this is going to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.859" end="00:36:43.240" style="s2">consequences of consequences if you like</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.470" end="00:36:44.950" style="s2">of the corona virus outbreak and I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.240" end="00:36:47.440" style="s2">one of the particularly cruel twists of</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.950" end="00:36:49.210" style="s2">this is that the people some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.440" end="00:36:50.680" style="s2">vulnerable people to coronavirus like</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.210" end="00:36:52.869" style="s2">elderly people who are the ones who will</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.680" end="00:36:54.819" style="s2">really need to stay home are often</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.869" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">communities among whom loneliness is</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.819" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">spiking in the first place there you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.760" end="00:37:01.510" style="s2">have this added twist that no they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.160" end="00:37:03.579" style="s2">be able to see the grandchildren but</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.510" end="00:37:05.829" style="s2">also they won&#39;t be able to have the kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.579" end="00:37:08.230" style="s2">of you know day-to-day so-called weak</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.829" end="00:37:09.819" style="s2">ties contact with people like you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.230" end="00:37:11.829" style="s2">someone at the GP surgery someone at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.819" end="00:37:13.180" style="s2">post office someone in the supermarket</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.829" end="00:37:14.650" style="s2">those sort of little day-to-day</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.180" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">interactions that make you feel at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.650" end="00:37:20.349" style="s2">connected in your community so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">emotional toll of all of this is going</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.349" end="00:37:25.359" style="s2">to be really hard you can have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:27.609" style="s2">people either sick or just isolating for</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">their own protection and feeling bored</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.609" end="00:37:32.859" style="s2">lonely anxious and then as the as the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.230" style="s2">epidemic moves on there will also be</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.859" end="00:37:37.630" style="s2">grief to contend with because you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.230" end="00:37:40.569" style="s2">we&#39;ll start to see deaths and I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.630" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">the question of what sort of support</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.569" end="00:37:44.109" style="s2">mechanisms we can get in place while</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:46.250" style="s2">obviously observing social distancing</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.109" end="00:37:48.350" style="s2">protocols a really important one</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.250" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">one of their really encouraging things</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.350" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">that is happening this weekend is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:53.180" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing lots and lots of things on</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:55.610" style="s2">Twitter where people are going out into</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.180" end="00:37:58.070" style="s2">their own communities just you know now</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.610" end="00:37:59.930" style="s2">before the tsunami hit to reach out and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.070" end="00:38:01.250" style="s2">just get their neighbors contact details</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.930" end="00:38:03.800" style="s2">and for example just set up a</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.250" end="00:38:05.900" style="s2">street-level whatsapp group which can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.800" end="00:38:08.030" style="s2">on the one hand a way for people to kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.900" end="00:38:09.950" style="s2">of check in and stay up with news and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.030" end="00:38:12.140" style="s2">share content and just sort of feel</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.950" end="00:38:14.450" style="s2">connected but also that&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.140" end="00:38:16.610" style="s2">way of coordinating community self-help</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.450" end="00:38:18.920" style="s2">so that if there&#39;s people that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.610" end="00:38:21.020" style="s2">need prescriptions or supermarket shops</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.920" end="00:38:23.420" style="s2">picking up or maybe they need cooking</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.020" end="00:38:25.490" style="s2">for all their dogs walking that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.420" end="00:38:27.380" style="s2">stuff can self-organize and just emerge</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.490" end="00:38:29.270" style="s2">very quickly but it is important that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.380" end="00:38:31.070" style="s2">you know the bandwidth the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.270" end="00:38:34.040" style="s2">social network connections are in place</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.070" end="00:38:36.350" style="s2">on whatsapp or on a Facebook group or</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.040" end="00:38:37.820" style="s2">whatever it may be before things get</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.350" end="00:38:39.530" style="s2">really difficult so that&#39;s a great</p>
