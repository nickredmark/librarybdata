<p begin="00:04:13.209" end="00:04:18.609" style="s2">happen is the mythological framing frame</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.480" end="00:04:20.980" style="s2">framework and the way people are framing</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.609" end="00:04:22.930" style="s2">themselves and their world changes now</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.980" end="00:04:25.000" style="s2">let me explain to you how I&#39;m using this</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.930" end="00:04:28.630" style="s2">word myth because I&#39;m not using it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.000" end="00:04:29.830" style="s2">way we standardly use it this you did</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.630" end="00:04:31.480" style="s2">the use I&#39;m going to talk about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.830" end="00:04:34.660" style="s2">been deeply influenced by people like</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.480" end="00:04:36.340" style="s2">young people like Tillich Victor Turner</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.660" end="00:04:38.840" style="s2">just a whole bunch of different fingers</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.340" end="00:04:40.250" style="s2">so when we use the word myth</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.840" end="00:04:45.070" style="s2">to mean a falsehood that is widely</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.250" end="00:04:48.260" style="s2">believed okay and that&#39;s unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.070" end="00:04:53.540" style="s2">because we&#39;ve lost the term for what I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.260" end="00:04:56.260" style="s2">want to talk about see miss aren&#39;t fault</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.540" end="00:04:59.330" style="s2">stories about the ancient past</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.260" end="00:05:02.030" style="s2">there&#39;s symbolic stories about perennial</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.330" end="00:05:07.639" style="s2">patterns that are always with us that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:09.979" style="s2">a very different thing so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.639" end="00:05:12.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in myth is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.979" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">take these intuitive implicitly learned</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.290" end="00:05:17.350" style="s2">patterns and put them into some form</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:23.690" style="s2">that is shareable with ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.350" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">with each other so in the Bronze Age</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:34.910" style="s2">experience the world in what&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.910" end="00:05:40.550" style="s2">continuous cosmos well I have a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.380" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">questions about the use of the word</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.550" end="00:05:44.470" style="s2">cosmos but we&#39;ll come back to that later</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.080" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">the idea here is human being has</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:06:00.069" style="s2">continuity that that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.620" end="00:06:03.310" style="s2">connectedness right that you see even</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.069" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">back in the shamanic world was very</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.310" end="00:06:06.340" style="s2">prevalent in the continuous cosmos and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:08.050" style="s2">the continuous cosmos people feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.340" end="00:06:09.909" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep connection a deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.050" end="00:06:12.550" style="s2">continuity between the natural world and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.909" end="00:06:15.509" style="s2">the cultural world and between the</p>

<p begin="00:06:15.509" end="00:06:22.569" style="s2">so the difference is right are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.229" end="00:06:25.569" style="s2">really differences so much in kind as</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.569" end="00:06:29.080" style="s2">they are in power it&#39;s not odd that</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.569" end="00:06:32.889" style="s2">animals might talk alright or they might</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.080" end="00:06:36.520" style="s2">have sort of deep societies it&#39;s not odd</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.889" end="00:06:39.940" style="s2">for us for certain human individuals to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.520" end="00:06:42.819" style="s2">think themselves divine like the</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.819" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">greatest pre Axial Age Empire is Egypt</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.699" end="00:06:52.210" style="s2">and the Pharaoh is a God king he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:54.029" style="s2">something like a God why for up for us</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.210" end="00:06:55.630" style="s2">we can only understand that at most</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.029" end="00:06:57.159" style="s2">metaphorically here&#39;s what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.630" end="00:07:02.830" style="s2">try and understand it&#39;s not a metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.159" end="00:07:07.750" style="s2">for the ancient Egyptians why because</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.830" end="00:07:09.550" style="s2">the difference is between right human</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.750" end="00:07:12.969" style="s2">beings and the gods our differences in</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.830" end="00:07:41.740" style="s2">or holy well those are used quite often</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.090" end="00:07:46.360" style="s2">but the term that&#39;s most used is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.740" end="00:07:49.419" style="s2">glorious shining with power right which</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.360" end="00:07:51.370" style="s2">it&#39;s not a moral term at all think of</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.419" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">the Greek gods they&#39;re not moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.370" end="00:07:56.650" style="s2">exemplars at all they&#39;re just extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:59.589" style="s2">glorious and extremely powerful the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.650" end="00:08:02.039" style="s2">Egyptian King the Pharaoh is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.589" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">glorious and extremely powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.039" end="00:08:09.210" style="s2">so of course he&#39;s godlike or potentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.490" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">even a god so there&#39;s a continuous</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.210" end="00:08:18.270" style="s2">cosmos and it&#39;s continuous in another</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:24.509" style="s2">way right it moves like this it moves in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.270" end="00:08:27.710" style="s2">great cycles just like the seasons just</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.509" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">like day and night time moves in large</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.710" end="00:08:37.680" style="s2">cycles that repeat through eternity in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.680" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">fact what you&#39;re often trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.680" end="00:08:43.110" style="s2">your ritual behavior is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:46.440" style="s2">tap into this continuity you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.110" end="00:08:53.569" style="s2">to get back to the original power of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.440" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">creation so you often enact the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.569" end="00:08:58.350" style="s2">metaphorical story the myth of how the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:02.730" style="s2">universe is created in order to try and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.350" end="00:09:04.529" style="s2">tap into that creative power there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.730" end="00:09:09.329" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a constant nostalgia</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.529" end="00:09:11.250" style="s2">for getting back right and your attitude</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.329" end="00:09:12.660" style="s2">towards the world is you want to fit in</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.250" end="00:09:14.190" style="s2">to these cycles you want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.660" end="00:09:16.350" style="s2">harmony with them you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.190" end="00:09:19.170" style="s2">really change things a lot because if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.350" end="00:09:23.399" style="s2">change this if I change my future I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.170" end="00:09:24.779" style="s2">actually undermining my past it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.399" end="00:09:27.920" style="s2">different way of relating to the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.779" end="00:09:31.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s there&#39;s this continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.920" end="00:09:35.970" style="s2">the natural world the social world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:43.110" style="s2">the divine world and time is wrapped on</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.970" end="00:09:44.940" style="s2">itself in this really important way now</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.110" end="00:09:46.500" style="s2">what happens in the axial age is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.940" end="00:09:48.630" style="s2">way of looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.500" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">is shattered now it doesn&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.630" end="00:09:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s aspects of our thinking that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:56.120" style="s2">still like this but what gets layered on</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.240" end="00:09:58.709" style="s2">top of it is a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.120" end="00:10:00.180" style="s2">worldview a totally different mythology</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.709" end="00:10:04.529" style="s2">for understanding the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.180" end="00:10:06.839" style="s2">between the self and the world so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.529" end="00:10:09.449" style="s2">Charles Taylor&#39;s talks about this as the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.839" end="00:10:13.649" style="s2">great dis embedding when the axial</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.449" end="00:10:16.590" style="s2">revolution hits this world is replaced</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.649" end="00:10:20.110" style="s2">by a different one</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.590" end="00:10:21.460" style="s2">now again I&#39;m speaking mythologically</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:22.960" style="s2">here people will talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.460" end="00:10:25.330" style="s2">mythologically and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.960" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">understand that doesn&#39;t mean the way we</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.330" end="00:10:28.570" style="s2">would think of it as a literal</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:31.180" style="s2">scientific thing nor is it what we would</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.570" end="00:10:36.750" style="s2">merely call metaphorical mythological is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.180" end="00:10:36.750" style="s2">neither scientific nor just metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.930" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">now what&#39;s this new world well this new</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.270" end="00:10:52.600" style="s2">mythological worldview uses a mythology</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.910" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">of two worlds the idea is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.600" end="00:11:02.830" style="s2">everyday world this is the world of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:05.800" style="s2">untrained mind this is a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.830" end="00:11:09.880" style="s2">beset by self-deception self-destruction</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.800" end="00:11:11.860" style="s2">the illusion violence chaos it&#39;s a world</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.880" end="00:11:19.150" style="s2">in which we are out of touch with</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.860" end="00:11:22.360" style="s2">reality but opposed to this is the real</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.150" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">world and mythologically you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.360" end="00:11:25.750" style="s2">about this as two worlds but of course</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">in a lot of the traditions the real</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.750" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">world is just cutting through the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">illusion of the everyday world but the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">idea is the real world is how the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">trained mind the wise mind sees the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:40.540" style="s2">world this is how the world looks when</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:42.820" style="s2">you&#39;re in touch with reality when your</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.540" end="00:11:44.950" style="s2">mind is not beset by illusion and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.820" end="00:11:48.220" style="s2">delusion when you have that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.950" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">this is how things really are this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.220" end="00:11:52.600" style="s2">world also in which there is reduced</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:54.640" style="s2">suffering and violence precisely because</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.600" end="00:11:57.130" style="s2">the mind is not beset by foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.640" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">precisely because it is not out of touch</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.130" end="00:11:59.910" style="s2">with reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.530" end="00:12:11.220" style="s2">now here wisdom is power oriented to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.080" end="00:12:15.370" style="s2">a wise individual is to learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.220" end="00:12:18.460" style="s2">acquire the power that was imbued at</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.370" end="00:12:20.110" style="s2">creation into the cycles it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:22.150" style="s2">energies put into the system and it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.110" end="00:12:23.830" style="s2">cycles around and then energy is put in</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.150" end="00:12:26.230" style="s2">the system it cycles around and you want</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.830" end="00:12:28.709" style="s2">to tap into that power wisdom is how to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.230" end="00:12:33.519" style="s2">tap in to that power</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.709" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">because what you&#39;re after is like long</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.519" end="00:12:39.070" style="s2">life live long and prosper</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">as it&#39;s in the Star Trek when with ology</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.070" end="00:12:42.279" style="s2">for the Vulcans right you you want to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:45.610" style="s2">prosperous you want to live long you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.279" end="00:12:47.500" style="s2">want to be free of conflict right you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.610" end="00:12:51.370" style="s2">want to provide security for your</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.500" end="00:12:53.230" style="s2">offspring so that&#39;s a sense of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.370" end="00:12:57.220" style="s2">that is still captured in our sense of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.230" end="00:12:59.050" style="s2">the word prudence right being very</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.220" end="00:13:01.149" style="s2">Prudential is to have that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.050" end="00:13:04.269" style="s2">knowing how to fit in to the power</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.149" end="00:13:07.630" style="s2">structures of society how to make things</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.269" end="00:13:12.519" style="s2">work for you getting the most power and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.630" end="00:13:17.079" style="s2">prosperity you can but over here there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.519" end="00:13:19.959" style="s2">a radical change wisdom changes because</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.079" end="00:13:24.810" style="s2">look you do not want to fit into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.959" end="00:13:28.029" style="s2">world because this is the world of</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.810" end="00:13:30.550" style="s2">suffering and violence it&#39;s a world in</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.029" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">which you&#39;re out of touch with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.550" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">real and as we&#39;ll talk about it later</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:36.819" style="s2">you deeply desire to be in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:41.079" style="s2">reality it&#39;s one of your most powerful</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.819" end="00:13:43.779" style="s2">drives you don&#39;t want to conform to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.079" end="00:13:48.940" style="s2">world you want to be transformed out of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.779" end="00:13:51.069" style="s2">this world you want to move from here to</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.940" end="00:13:54.760" style="s2">here now notice what&#39;s happening here</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.069" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">the old shamanic enacted myth of soul</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.760" end="00:14:00.519" style="s2">flight flying above is being accepted</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.980" style="s2">into a new sense it&#39;s being exempted</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.519" end="00:14:07.000" style="s2">into this sense of self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.980" end="00:14:12.190" style="s2">out of the everyday world into the real</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.000" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">world and wisdom is now knowing how to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.190" end="00:14:22.089" style="s2">make that transformative leap and</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:24.910" style="s2">meaning isn&#39;t about just connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.089" end="00:14:28.510" style="s2">as it was here but a special kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">connectedness a connectedness to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.510" end="00:14:36.010" style="s2">real world as opposed to a detrimental</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:39.250" style="s2">connectedness to an illusory world so</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.010" end="00:14:40.680" style="s2">meaning is changing and the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.250" end="00:14:44.220" style="s2">wisdom is changing</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.680" end="00:14:47.130" style="s2">and the notion of yourself what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.220" end="00:14:50.339" style="s2">be a self because here you&#39;re defined</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.130" end="00:14:51.690" style="s2">largely by how you fit in and of course</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.339" end="00:14:53.190" style="s2">that&#39;s always gonna be part of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.690" end="00:14:54.480" style="s2">definition I&#39;m talking about emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.190" end="00:14:57.060" style="s2">here I&#39;m not talking about absolute</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.480" end="00:15:01.740" style="s2">differences but here you&#39;re defined more</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.060" end="00:15:05.399" style="s2">by how you fit in but here you defined</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.740" end="00:15:09.570" style="s2">increasingly more by how you can self</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.399" end="00:15:11.029" style="s2">transcend self transform how you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.570" end="00:15:14.760" style="s2">grow as a person</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.029" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">notice how pervasive this has become in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.760" end="00:15:20.370" style="s2">our self understand notice how we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:24.060" style="s2">like to be with people who aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:15:24.060" end="00:15:31.290" style="s2">growing which way do you growing up</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.709" end="00:15:39.140" style="s2">right becoming more mature getting more</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.290" end="00:15:41.790" style="s2">in touch with themselves and reality so</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.140" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">this is called the great dis embedding</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.790" end="00:15:47.790" style="s2">because now we we have a different</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">relationship to the everyday world and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.790" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">this is a metaphor that you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:54.959" style="s2">before you don&#39;t see over here this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:15:56.660" style="s2">the idea that we&#39;re somehow strangers in</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.959" end="00:16:01.140" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.660" end="00:16:02.779" style="s2">we&#39;re pilgrims we don&#39;t belong here we</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.140" end="00:16:05.670" style="s2">belong there</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.779" end="00:16:07.410" style="s2">now as I keep saying I mean some people</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.670" end="00:16:09.690" style="s2">some people of course will literal eyes</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.410" end="00:16:10.260" style="s2">this and this is really one world in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.690" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">another world</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.260" end="00:16:13.529" style="s2">most people will see this alike we talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:15.230" style="s2">about Plato and others their</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.529" end="00:16:18.390" style="s2">understanding this as a mythological</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.230" end="00:16:25.430" style="s2">representation for the process of self</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.390" end="00:16:29.520" style="s2">transcendence and self transformation so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.430" end="00:16:31.620" style="s2">once again we see the exaptation just</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.520" end="00:16:34.410" style="s2">like the shamans were engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.620" end="00:16:40.370" style="s2">excitation we see the acceptation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.410" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">that shamanic ability into this new</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.370" end="00:16:43.760" style="s2">mythological framework</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.070" end="00:16:50.490" style="s2">so there&#39;s three places that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.940" end="00:16:53.470" style="s2">talk about in particular about this</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.490" end="00:16:55.800" style="s2">because they&#39;re the ones that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.470" end="00:16:58.570" style="s2">going to talk a lot about I will mention</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.800" end="00:17:01.480" style="s2">China periodically throughout especially</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.570" end="00:17:04.419" style="s2">when I talk about Taoism but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.480" end="00:17:06.329" style="s2">talk about Greece and ancient Israel</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.419" end="00:17:09.309" style="s2">because those are the two foundational</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.329" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">world mythologies for us those are two</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.309" end="00:17:13.949" style="s2">places and when theocracy or revolution</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:17.380" style="s2">took place in a way that has become</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.949" end="00:17:21.819" style="s2">deeply deeply constitutive of what we</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.380" end="00:17:24.040" style="s2">are how we are still here in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.819" end="00:17:26.189" style="s2">the way we experience ourselves and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.040" end="00:17:32.770" style="s2">world I also want to talk about India</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.189" end="00:17:38.320" style="s2">because India is the source of that of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.770" end="00:17:41.309" style="s2">that how do I put it that source of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.320" end="00:17:43.990" style="s2">confluence between Buddhism and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.309" end="00:17:45.580" style="s2">Western world that we talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.990" end="00:17:48.280" style="s2">the first session together</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.580" end="00:17:50.500" style="s2">the mindfulness revolution mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.280" end="00:17:52.929" style="s2">is a psycho technology that came from</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.500" end="00:17:55.419" style="s2">India so the axial revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.929" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">Siddhartha Gautama and the Buddha we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.419" end="00:18:01.090" style="s2">going to talk about that and what I want</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:04.179" style="s2">to talk about is how each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.090" end="00:18:06.610" style="s2">areas in addition to the axial psycho</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.179" end="00:18:08.890" style="s2">technologies of literacy and coinage</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.610" end="00:18:11.230" style="s2">alphabetic literacy and coinage write</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.890" end="00:18:14.230" style="s2">how they also develop particular psycho</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.230" end="00:18:17.049" style="s2">technologies that have become</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.230" end="00:18:19.510" style="s2">internalized a lot of what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.049" end="00:18:21.970" style="s2">natural to you just part of how your</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.510" end="00:18:24.130" style="s2">mind works is actually culturally</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.970" end="00:18:25.990" style="s2">internalized it has been generated</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.130" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">historically and you have internalized</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.990" end="00:18:31.990" style="s2">it culturally and you think of it just</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:34.540" style="s2">as how your mind works think again about</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.990" end="00:18:37.480" style="s2">literacy it is hard for you to remember</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.540" end="00:18:41.740" style="s2">and I mean to reenact what it was like</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.480" end="00:18:46.260" style="s2">to not be able to think in write like</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.740" end="00:18:46.260" style="s2">literate terms to imagine words</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.640" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">in a similar way a lot of these ways of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.210" end="00:18:55.140" style="s2">thinking these psycho technologies have</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">become so second nature to us that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.140" end="00:18:59.580" style="s2">forget the historical origin and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:01.950" style="s2">problematic because the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.580" end="00:19:05.280" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a historical understanding</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.950" end="00:19:07.590" style="s2">is a degree to which we are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.280" end="00:19:11.010" style="s2">ignorant of the historical factors that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.590" end="00:19:12.750" style="s2">are driving the meaning crisis let me</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.010" end="00:19:14.910" style="s2">foreshadow that meeting crisis right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.750" end="00:19:20.100" style="s2">so this is a mere foreshadowing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.910" end="00:19:25.350" style="s2">going to come back to it this is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.100" end="00:19:31.230" style="s2">mythological way of thinking which</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.350" end="00:19:33.000" style="s2">allows us to articulate and train the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.230" end="00:19:35.250" style="s2">psycho technologies of the axial</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.000" end="00:19:39.090" style="s2">revolution these psycho technologies of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.250" end="00:19:44.460" style="s2">self-transcendence of wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.090" end="00:19:49.110" style="s2">enhanced meaning but the problem is this</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.460" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">mythology is failing for us now the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.110" end="00:19:57.419" style="s2">scientific worldview is destroying the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:20:00.470" style="s2">possibility of this for us in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.419" end="00:20:03.090" style="s2">might seem sort of cosmically or ironic</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.470" end="00:20:05.940" style="s2">the scientific worldview is returning us</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.090" end="00:20:08.250" style="s2">to a continuous cosmos there is no</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.940" end="00:20:11.040" style="s2">radical difference in kind between you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.250" end="00:20:15.059" style="s2">and the primates that you evolved from</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.040" end="00:20:18.090" style="s2">naturally there isn&#39;t some radical</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.059" end="00:20:21.650" style="s2">difference in kind between your mind and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.090" end="00:20:25.890" style="s2">your embodied existence right science is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.650" end="00:20:32.190" style="s2">leveling the world we&#39;re returning to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.890" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">one world we&#39;re going to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.190" end="00:20:38.910" style="s2">but if we can no longer live in this</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">mythology and that&#39;s what mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.910" end="00:20:44.580" style="s2">are they&#39;re they have to be livable</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:46.110" style="s2">people claim to believe this don&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.580" end="00:20:49.520" style="s2">me what you believe tell me what you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.110" end="00:20:52.049" style="s2">practice tell me what&#39;s livable for you</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.520" end="00:20:52.650" style="s2">for most of us we can&#39;t live this</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.049" end="00:20:56.250" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.650" end="00:20:58.590" style="s2">we still talk this way but we can&#39;t live</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.250" end="00:21:00.280" style="s2">it so here&#39;s part of the problem this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.590" end="00:21:05.990" style="s2">a foreshadowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:08.210" style="s2">how do we salvage the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.990" end="00:21:11.770" style="s2">cultivate wisdom self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.210" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">enhance meaning overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.770" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">realize realize who we are and how the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:24.950" style="s2">world is when we can no longer use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:32.419" style="s2">mythological worldview in which it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.950" end="00:21:36.440" style="s2">born we are going through a reimburse of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.419" end="00:21:38.809" style="s2">and increasing right Copernicus and</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.640" end="00:21:49.309" style="s2">world but we don&#39;t want to lose all that</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.900" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">we gained through the great dis</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.309" end="00:21:56.179" style="s2">embedding how do we reconcile those how</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:59.030" style="s2">do we live with the legacy of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.179" end="00:22:02.059" style="s2">revolution when we can no longer inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.030" end="00:22:06.350" style="s2">its world of view that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.059" end="00:22:11.380" style="s2">problem that&#39;s only part now the place I</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.350" end="00:22:14.120" style="s2">want to turn to first is ancient Israel</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.380" end="00:22:17.090" style="s2">as I mentioned some of you have probably</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.120" end="00:22:18.679" style="s2">read parts of the Bible or at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.090" end="00:22:22.940" style="s2">heard parts of the Bible although</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.679" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">biblical illiteracy is rising and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.940" end="00:22:27.049" style="s2">problematic not not because I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">people should be Christians or Jews I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.049" end="00:22:32.000" style="s2">not here to proselytize but the degree</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:34.730" style="s2">to which you don&#39;t have a grasp of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.000" end="00:22:36.470" style="s2">grammar of the Bible is it re to which</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.730" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a grasp of the grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.470" end="00:22:40.280" style="s2">your own cognition and you may say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.530" style="s2">an atheist I don&#39;t care that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.280" end="00:22:46.179" style="s2">irrelevant I&#39;m not talking about what</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.530" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">you say I&#39;m talking about how you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.179" end="00:22:50.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a big difference there grammar</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:53.260" style="s2">is how you put thoughts together it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.510" end="00:22:56.809" style="s2">not the vocabulary it&#39;s not what you say</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.260" end="00:23:01.340" style="s2">and so this is what Nietzsche meant and</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.809" end="00:23:02.900" style="s2">like like when he said I fear we are not</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.340" end="00:23:08.660" style="s2">getting rid of God because we still</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.900" end="00:23:11.720" style="s2">believe in grammar we still talk this</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.660" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">way we still are filled with the god</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.720" end="00:23:17.830" style="s2">grammar</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:19.990" style="s2">of the Bible and you say no I&#39;m not yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.830" end="00:23:22.840" style="s2">you go to a movie and you watch the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.990" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">person who falls in some way and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.840" end="00:23:26.170" style="s2">they have an insight and they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.670" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">redeemed and they find their way back</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.170" end="00:23:30.070" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s through Alcoholics Anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:35.470" style="s2">or they come out of addiction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.070" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">biblical grammar okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.470" end="00:23:42.580" style="s2">again what matters here is how it shapes</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:44.470" style="s2">our sense of self and world I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.580" end="00:23:45.820" style="s2">advocating for a particular religion but</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.470" end="00:23:47.920" style="s2">of course I&#39;m going to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.820" end="00:23:50.350" style="s2">judeo-christian heritage precisely</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.920" end="00:23:53.320" style="s2">because I want to explain to you how</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.350" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">these psycho technologies have been part</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.320" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">of the very grammar not only of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:24:07.150" style="s2">cognition but of your existential sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:10.000" style="s2">of being so there&#39;s an important psycho</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.150" end="00:24:12.790" style="s2">technology that&#39;s invented or at least</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.000" end="00:24:15.670" style="s2">significantly developed by ancient</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.790" end="00:24:20.410" style="s2">Israel perhaps it was influenced from</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.670" end="00:24:22.809" style="s2">from Persia through Zarathustra but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.410" end="00:24:24.460" style="s2">this idea and when I say it it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.809" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">seem to you like of course but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.460" end="00:24:31.390" style="s2">of course even saying of course is</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:33.929" style="s2">important remember that here&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.390" end="00:24:37.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a psycho technology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.929" end="00:24:41.590" style="s2">understanding time as a cosmic narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.300" end="00:24:43.929" style="s2">as a story it&#39;s applying something again</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.590" end="00:24:45.309" style="s2">that&#39;s universal all cultures tell</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.929" end="00:24:49.210" style="s2">stories and we&#39;ll talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.309" end="00:24:52.480" style="s2">cognitive science of this later but you</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.210" end="00:24:54.450" style="s2">see this isn&#39;t a story this is a circle</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.480" end="00:24:56.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.450" end="00:25:00.100" style="s2">what kind of structure does a story how</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.800" end="00:25:04.679" style="s2">well the story has a beginning and has</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.100" end="00:25:07.720" style="s2">some crucial climax turning point and</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.679" end="00:25:13.440" style="s2">that and there&#39;s a resolution there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.720" end="00:25:16.929" style="s2">direction to it there&#39;s a purpose to it</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.440" end="00:25:22.350" style="s2">so you get this idea of cosmic history</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.929" end="00:25:26.180" style="s2">of using our skills for story to explain</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.350" end="00:25:33.530" style="s2">how the cosmos is unfolding through time</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.180" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a radical idea so why is it radical</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.530" end="00:25:41.300" style="s2">well notice the difference here this</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:44.060" style="s2">this is not an open future right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.300" end="00:25:46.040" style="s2">condemned to repeat that so cultures</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.060" end="00:25:48.500" style="s2">we&#39;re cyclical time is still prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.040" end="00:25:51.740" style="s2">Eastern cultures for example the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.500" end="00:25:52.400" style="s2">repetition of the cycle is onerous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.740" end="00:25:54.650" style="s2">horrible</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.400" end="00:25:56.270" style="s2">people think reincarnation for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.650" end="00:25:58.100" style="s2">within an Indian context is a wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.270" end="00:26:00.560" style="s2">I&#39;ll be born again that&#39;s good no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.100" end="00:26:03.890" style="s2">horrible what you&#39;re trying to do is get</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.560" end="00:26:05.990" style="s2">free from those cycles because doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.890" end="00:26:10.330" style="s2">this again and again and again and again</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.990" end="00:26:13.340" style="s2">and again is terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.330" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">moksha you want freedom nirvana you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.340" end="00:26:21.730" style="s2">cessation you want release from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:21.730" style="s2">cycle because there is no purpose to it</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.350" end="00:26:35.780" style="s2">but here the futures opened your actions</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.740" end="00:26:36.980" style="s2">now can change the future if you figure</p>

<p begin="00:27:42.290" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">to them what&#39;s the God of the Old</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.270" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">think of the great story of the Old</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:06.260" style="s2">right here you have the Israelites and</p>

<p begin="00:28:06.260" end="00:28:14.750" style="s2">in the epitome of the Bronze Age world</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.370" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">he has no name because to name something</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.270" end="00:28:42.410" style="s2">is to locate it to specify it to tie it</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:46.730" style="s2">down and for the longest time this God</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.410" end="00:28:49.190" style="s2">has no name and then when Moses finally</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.730" end="00:28:51.830" style="s2">challenges it and he reveals his name he</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.190" end="00:28:53.419" style="s2">says it&#39;s badly translated in the older</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.830" end="00:28:56.510" style="s2">versions of the Bible it&#39;s often</p>

<p begin="00:28:56.510" end="00:29:00.650" style="s2">in the Hebrew means I will be what I</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.790" end="00:29:16.340" style="s2">because you can shape it you can cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.940" end="00:29:22.250" style="s2">it to come to resolution but you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.340" end="00:29:24.049" style="s2">also cause it to go off course the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.250" end="00:29:28.760" style="s2">when I said of course to you remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.049" end="00:29:32.600" style="s2">the sense of time passing as a course we</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.760" end="00:29:36.470" style="s2">still take courses in universities this</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.600" end="00:29:40.580" style="s2">is what we have here and you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.470" end="00:29:42.950" style="s2">for turning points where the course</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.580" end="00:29:45.590" style="s2">turns and of course that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.950" end="00:29:47.900" style="s2">looking for in a movie you know at some</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.590" end="00:29:52.940" style="s2">level that none of that is how the real</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.900" end="00:29:55.070" style="s2">world works you know at Psalm level come</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.940" end="00:29:58.749" style="s2">you do that your life doesn&#39;t unfold</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.070" end="00:30:01.279" style="s2">like a movie yet you love it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.749" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">you love going to a movie you love</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.279" end="00:30:05.989" style="s2">seeing this structure and participating</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:10.820" style="s2">in it and there&#39;s the great turning</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.989" end="00:30:13.099" style="s2">point where something is learned or a</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.820" end="00:30:25.090" style="s2">problem is solved and there&#39;s resolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.099" end="00:30:29.960" style="s2">and the future is now made so this God</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.090" end="00:30:32.509" style="s2">is interested in becomes progressively</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.960" end="00:30:34.369" style="s2">not now again you can&#39;t point and say</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.509" end="00:30:36.979" style="s2">there there&#39;s where it changed in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.369" end="00:30:40.909" style="s2">Bible but you can see there&#39;s aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.979" end="00:30:42.440" style="s2">a pre Axio god but as you read through</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.909" end="00:30:44.059" style="s2">the new as you read through the Old</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.440" end="00:30:51.139" style="s2">Testament God becomes more and more</p>

<p begin="00:30:53.509" end="00:31:00.039" style="s2">granted progress</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.929" end="00:31:08.989" style="s2">the idea and right for us it&#39;s not just</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.379" end="00:31:39.129" style="s2">there&#39;s a technical term for these</p>

<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:02.299" style="s2">talk about that because again we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:32:16.370" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">so people sometimes note and often</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.909" end="00:32:25.400" style="s2">humorously that the Bible will talk</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.540" end="00:35:07.040" style="s2">well that&#39;s the off now of course you</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.590" end="00:35:10.520" style="s2">can get it wrong you can think you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.040" end="00:35:14.990" style="s2">course when you&#39;re actually dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.520" end="00:35:17.780" style="s2">off course you&#39;re trespassing to use</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.990" end="00:35:21.320" style="s2">older biblical language you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.780" end="00:35:24.410" style="s2">off the path you&#39;re no longer on course</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.320" end="00:35:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the basis of a word that</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.410" end="00:35:28.280" style="s2">we can&#39;t use anymore again because of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.720" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">our biblical literacy and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.280" end="00:35:32.840" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost touch with this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">knowing in fact this word many people</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.840" end="00:35:41.030" style="s2">treat this word almost like like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:46.580" style="s2">comical word sin sinning isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.030" end="00:35:47.870" style="s2">doing something very immoral right in</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.580" end="00:35:49.460" style="s2">the New Testament the word that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.870" end="00:35:50.620" style="s2">translates this is when you&#39;re shooting</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.460" end="00:35:53.090" style="s2">a bow and arrow</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.620" end="00:35:54.710" style="s2">so if you&#39;ve done archery you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.090" end="00:35:55.970" style="s2">shoot for where your eye tells you to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.710" end="00:35:58.040" style="s2">look because you&#39;ll actually miss the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.970" end="00:36:01.370" style="s2">bull&#39;s eye you have to have a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.040" end="00:36:03.380" style="s2">faith to sense right where you need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.370" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">actually shoot so you don&#39;t miss the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.380" end="00:36:11.000" style="s2">mark so the idea here is I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:13.990" style="s2">sense the course of things and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.000" end="00:36:15.740" style="s2">self deluded or illusory I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.990" end="00:36:21.220" style="s2">dramatically off course without</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.740" end="00:36:25.780" style="s2">realizing it that&#39;s the original meaning</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.220" end="00:36:28.700" style="s2">and so the idea is that human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.780" end="00:36:32.630" style="s2">thrown into this universe in which they</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.700" end="00:36:35.930" style="s2">have the option because it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.630" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">future of participating in the creation</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.930" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">of the future but of course human beings</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:40.990" style="s2">sin</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.330" end="00:36:48.230" style="s2">in the sense that they are</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.840" end="00:36:49.700" style="s2">self-deceptive they go off course so</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.230" end="00:36:52.250" style="s2">notice what the Hebrews are doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.700" end="00:36:54.230" style="s2">they&#39;re taking this movement from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.250" end="00:36:56.390" style="s2">everyday world to the real world and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.230" end="00:36:59.570" style="s2">they&#39;re turning it into a historical</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.390" end="00:37:01.970" style="s2">story the way you go from the false</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.570" end="00:37:05.380" style="s2">world to the real world is you start now</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.970" end="00:37:11.930" style="s2">and you move towards the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.380" end="00:37:14.480" style="s2">they understand it historically but</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.930" end="00:37:20.140" style="s2">human being sinned they make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.480" end="00:37:26.890" style="s2">that steer the course of history away</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.140" end="00:37:30.410" style="s2">from its culmination and so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.890" end="00:37:35.540" style="s2">God has to intervene periodically God</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.410" end="00:37:39.950" style="s2">has to redeem God has to do something to</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.540" end="00:37:41.870" style="s2">wake people up to remind them to help</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.950" end="00:37:44.840" style="s2">them to sense how they&#39;ve gone of course</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.870" end="00:37:49.370" style="s2">and so that they can come back on course</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.840" end="00:37:51.530" style="s2">and so what you have is you have in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.370" end="00:37:54.200" style="s2">Old Testament you have the creation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.530" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">the prophetic tradition prophets here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.200" end="00:37:59.510" style="s2">another thing that we&#39;ve lost the sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:38:01.010" style="s2">of a prophet is not somebody who for who</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.510" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">tells the future like some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.010" end="00:38:07.490" style="s2">psychic okay prophecy isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">telling you what&#39;s going to be happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.490" end="00:38:17.270" style="s2">200 or 300 years from now prophecy means</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:21.290" style="s2">a telling fourth yeah the job of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.270" end="00:38:25.910" style="s2">Prophet is to wake you up right now to</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.290" end="00:38:28.400" style="s2">how you are off course so a better</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.910" end="00:38:29.840" style="s2">analogy isn&#39;t the psychic when you so</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.400" end="00:38:31.790" style="s2">when you go to the psychic and oh you</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.840" end="00:38:34.040" style="s2">Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger or some</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.790" end="00:38:36.440" style="s2">crap like that that&#39;s not a good analogy</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.040" end="00:38:38.690" style="s2">for a prophet a better profit is when</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.440" end="00:38:43.070" style="s2">you and your loved one go into therapy</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.690" end="00:38:46.010" style="s2">and the therapist says something and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.070" end="00:38:47.930" style="s2">wakes you up the Holy crop this is how</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.010" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">I&#39;m going wrong this is how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.930" end="00:38:53.890" style="s2">off-course this is how I need to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:53.890" style="s2">back on track</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.050" end="00:39:00.380" style="s2">that&#39;s the job of a prophet and what you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.370" end="00:39:09.110" style="s2">have in the prophetic tradition is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.380" end="00:39:13.430" style="s2">have an increasing emphasis on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.110" end="00:39:15.860" style="s2">morality of human decision-making more</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.430" end="00:39:18.050" style="s2">and more and again it&#39;s not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.860" end="00:39:19.940" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of pre axial stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.050" end="00:39:21.890" style="s2">that&#39;s still woven in there and mixed up</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.940" end="00:39:25.580" style="s2">with it and mashed up with it but you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.890" end="00:39:28.190" style="s2">have more and more this discussion this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.580" end="00:39:32.900" style="s2">exhortation to wake up to your moral</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.190" end="00:39:35.390" style="s2">responsibility for helping everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.900" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">get back on track and to turn things</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.390" end="00:39:44.060" style="s2">back towards the promised land this idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.690" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">of justice and righteousness and waking</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.060" end="00:39:51.920" style="s2">up so that we get back on track become</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:53.000" style="s2">endemic now think about how much and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.920" end="00:39:55.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to show you three examples</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.000" end="00:39:59.090" style="s2">how much this is just how you naturally</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.430" end="00:40:01.580" style="s2">think of yourself you think of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.090" end="00:40:03.530" style="s2">as somebody who&#39;s on a journey you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.580" end="00:40:05.300" style="s2">starting here and you&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.530" end="00:40:07.040" style="s2">a better self and you&#39;re trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.300" end="00:40:12.080" style="s2">the right decisions and you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.040" end="00:40:14.390" style="s2">steer things you want your life to</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.080" end="00:40:20.390" style="s2">progress you want your culture to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.390" end="00:40:23.240" style="s2">progress try to think about what how you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.390" end="00:40:28.310" style="s2">would understand yourself how you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.240" end="00:40:31.300" style="s2">judge yourself and you couldn&#39;t make use</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.310" end="00:40:31.300" style="s2">of this notion of progress</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.710" end="00:40:49.869" style="s2">so what starts to happen is a commitment</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.520" end="00:40:53.980" style="s2">to more and more trying to cultivate the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.869" end="00:40:57.420" style="s2">wisdom of deeply remembering God which</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.980" end="00:41:03.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean reciting beliefs it means</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.420" end="00:41:07.570" style="s2">participating participating in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.220" end="00:41:10.990" style="s2">ongoing creation of the world shaping</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.570" end="00:41:13.890" style="s2">the future helping yourself your</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.990" end="00:41:17.230" style="s2">neighbors in your society to progress</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.890" end="00:41:20.530" style="s2">where that progress is measured mostly</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.230" end="00:41:23.410" style="s2">in terms of moral improvement increasing</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.530" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">justice increasing flourishing</p>

<p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">your promise is it an important thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.550" end="00:41:41.619" style="s2">for you if it is and I feel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:44.200" style="s2">probably the case that for many of you</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.619" end="00:41:46.089" style="s2">it is that very way of thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.200" end="00:41:49.570" style="s2">part of the grammar that we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.089" end="00:41:52.660" style="s2">inherited from the Hebrews it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.570" end="00:41:57.640" style="s2">the very way we think it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.660" end="00:42:01.270" style="s2">warp and woof of our cognition now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.640" end="00:42:02.890" style="s2">going to come back to this strand we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.270" end="00:42:06.810" style="s2">going to come back and look at a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.890" end="00:42:10.089" style="s2">particular way of understanding Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.810" end="00:42:11.859" style="s2">that became right central and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.089" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">Christianity because what Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.859" end="00:42:18.280" style="s2">did is it made a really radical claim it</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">claimed that this Kairos was found in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.280" end="00:42:23.980" style="s2">particular person and what&#39;s that what</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.200" style="s2">that&#39;s going to do is it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.980" end="00:42:30.070" style="s2">personalize all of this in a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.200" end="00:42:32.440" style="s2">dramatic way but before we do that I</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.070" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">want to switch back over to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.440" end="00:42:37.560" style="s2">happening in a similar time in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:37.560" style="s2">Greece</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:45.360" style="s2">as I mentioned the psycho technology of</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.980" end="00:42:46.770" style="s2">alphabetic literacy is taken to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.360" end="00:42:48.510" style="s2">Greeks but the Greeks do something</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.770" end="00:42:50.730" style="s2">that&#39;s very important and it helps to</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.510" end="00:42:52.890" style="s2">explain right some of the differences we</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.730" end="00:42:57.390" style="s2">see in the Greek axial revolution from</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.890" end="00:42:59.100" style="s2">the ancient Hebrew actual revolution now</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.390" end="00:43:02.340" style="s2">the Greeks do something that again seems</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.100" end="00:43:07.620" style="s2">inconsequential now but they add vowels</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.340" end="00:43:10.230" style="s2">to the alphabet and it&#39;s like oh well so</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.620" end="00:43:13.530" style="s2">what well the thing is when you add</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.230" end="00:43:17.010" style="s2">vowels you really again increase how</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.530" end="00:43:18.660" style="s2">easy it is to process information so</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.010" end="00:43:21.720" style="s2">let&#39;s stop here because we need to be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.660" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">cognitive science because this ease of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.720" end="00:43:27.150" style="s2">processing really matters so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:29.370" style="s2">introduce you to an important idea from</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.150" end="00:43:39.900" style="s2">cognitive science this is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.370" end="00:43:41.670" style="s2">cognitive fluency so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.900" end="00:43:43.410" style="s2">increasing experimental evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.670" end="00:43:45.660" style="s2">this basic kind of fact when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.410" end="00:43:48.300" style="s2">increase the ease at which people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.660" end="00:43:49.500" style="s2">process information regardless of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.300" end="00:43:51.300" style="s2">that information is</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.500" end="00:43:55.310" style="s2">they come to believe it is more real</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.300" end="00:43:58.800" style="s2">they have more confidence in it etc now</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.310" end="00:44:00.660" style="s2">that can be something very simple it can</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.800" end="00:44:03.450" style="s2">be as simple as changing the font</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.660" end="00:44:07.590" style="s2">contrast between the letters and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.450" end="00:44:11.670" style="s2">page so consider two individuals Tom and</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.590" end="00:44:13.800" style="s2">Susan Tom is reading our words in which</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.670" end="00:44:16.920" style="s2">the color contrasts between the letters</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.800" end="00:44:18.960" style="s2">and the page isn&#39;t as good as the color</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.920" end="00:44:20.760" style="s2">contrast that Susan&#39;s reading they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.960" end="00:44:22.860" style="s2">reading exactly the same thing they can</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.760" end="00:44:24.570" style="s2">both clearly read it it&#39;s just the font</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.860" end="00:44:30.300" style="s2">difference makes it easier for Susan</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.570" end="00:44:32.850" style="s2">than for Tom they read the same thing if</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.300" end="00:44:33.540" style="s2">you ask both of them well how true is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.850" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">what you read</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.540" end="00:44:39.390" style="s2">Susan&#39;s more likely to say that was true</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:42.750" style="s2">which is more likely to have confident</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.390" end="00:44:45.380" style="s2">in it regardless of the content the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.750" end="00:44:49.350" style="s2">fluency of your processing actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.380" end="00:44:51.560" style="s2">increases your confidence in it your</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.350" end="00:44:55.140" style="s2">sense of how real</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.560" end="00:44:57.360" style="s2">the picture it&#39;s giving you is now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.140" end="00:44:59.820" style="s2">not really ease in some simple sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.360" end="00:45:01.410" style="s2">because right it has to do more with how</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.820" end="00:45:04.140" style="s2">well your brain is accessing information</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.410" end="00:45:07.380" style="s2">applying it it&#39;s very complicated right</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.140" end="00:45:10.560" style="s2">but what I&#39;m telling you is when I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.380" end="00:45:14.130" style="s2">something that increases your cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.560" end="00:45:16.770" style="s2">fluency you get an enhanced sense of</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.130" end="00:45:18.030" style="s2">your brain your brain get generates an</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.770" end="00:45:19.740" style="s2">enhanced sense that you&#39;re actually in</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.030" end="00:45:21.630" style="s2">touch with things we&#39;ll talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.740" end="00:45:24.450" style="s2">later that turns out to be a good policy</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.630" end="00:45:26.490" style="s2">your brain is using it&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.450" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">idea for your brain to try and use the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.490" end="00:45:30.840" style="s2">fluency of its own processing as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:36.960" style="s2">measure of how much it&#39;s in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.840" end="00:45:39.240" style="s2">reality by the way when you get a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.960" end="00:45:42.920" style="s2">fluency you of course are going to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.240" end="00:45:42.920" style="s2">into the flow State</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.390" end="00:45:51.870" style="s2">so when the Greeks introduce vowels they</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">improve the fluency of alphabetic</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.870" end="00:45:58.490" style="s2">literacy they ramp up how powerful it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:45:58.490" style="s2">they also just introduced something else</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.580" end="00:46:02.760" style="s2">they introduced a standardized reading</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.260" end="00:46:05.700" style="s2">from left to right which you now take</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.760" end="00:46:07.140" style="s2">for granted many of you know that other</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.700" end="00:46:11.190" style="s2">languages go the other way</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.140" end="00:46:12.990" style="s2">Hebrews read this way for example that</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.190" end="00:46:14.790" style="s2">has an impact on your cognition first of</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.990" end="00:46:16.860" style="s2">all it&#39;s standardized that improves the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.790" end="00:46:19.410" style="s2">fluency why does it improve your fluency</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.860" end="00:46:21.000" style="s2">when this is standard you know always if</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.410" end="00:46:23.190" style="s2">you look at Egyptian hieroglyphs they</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.000" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">can go up they can go down they can go</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.190" end="00:46:27.900" style="s2">this way they can go that way when you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:34.410" style="s2">standardize things that increases the</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.900" end="00:46:36.860" style="s2">fluency of the processing so they rats</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.410" end="00:46:36.860" style="s2">it up</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.090" end="00:46:47.970" style="s2">this power of literacy to enhance</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.050" end="00:46:50.430" style="s2">cognition they&#39;re also developing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.970" end="00:46:52.290" style="s2">something else so the Greeks don&#39;t form</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.430" end="00:46:53.580" style="s2">a unified nation state they have</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.290" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">individual city-states that are in</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.580" end="00:46:58.950" style="s2">competition with each other and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:01.200" style="s2">Athens in particular and oftens is going</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.950" end="00:47:03.510" style="s2">to be the hotbed of the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.200" end="00:47:06.780" style="s2">in Greece although not the only place in</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.510" end="00:47:12.150" style="s2">Athens you have slowly the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.780" end="00:47:13.620" style="s2">democracy now it&#39;s it&#39;s a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.150" end="00:47:15.510" style="s2">problematic form of democracy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.620" end="00:47:18.000" style="s2">direct democracy we&#39;ll talk about stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.510" end="00:47:20.340" style="s2">like that later but what this does is</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.000" end="00:47:28.230" style="s2">this puts a premium on argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.340" end="00:47:30.840" style="s2">debate so the Greeks start to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.230" end="00:47:34.560" style="s2">speed up the actual revolution of their</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.840" end="00:47:36.950" style="s2">own cognition they enhance the effects</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.560" end="00:47:41.270" style="s2">of alphabetic literacy they enhance</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.950" end="00:47:44.370" style="s2">write the use of reason and reflection</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.270" end="00:47:47.130" style="s2">and so they start to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.370" end="00:47:50.220" style="s2">again don&#39;t happen before lots of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.130" end="00:47:53.130" style="s2">cultures were doing arithmetic but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.220" end="00:47:57.300" style="s2">Greeks invent mathematics they invent</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.130" end="00:48:02.130" style="s2">geometry they start to create abstract</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.300" end="00:48:05.400" style="s2">symbol systems for their own sake now</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.130" end="00:48:10.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going on in what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.400" end="00:48:17.100" style="s2">basically being invented in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.340" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">Greece is this capacity for rational</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.100" end="00:48:23.340" style="s2">argumentation that&#39;s the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">technology again you think of this no I</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.340" end="00:48:27.810" style="s2">want to be cleaner I&#39;m not claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:29.850" style="s2">other groups or people are irrational or</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.810" end="00:48:32.100" style="s2">there can&#39;t be reasonable I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.850" end="00:48:35.670" style="s2">ethnocentric but you get the explicit</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.100" end="00:48:40.430" style="s2">training of rational argumentation as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.670" end="00:48:40.430" style="s2">core psycho technology in ancient Greece</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.540" end="00:48:48.680" style="s2">now that is going to have very important</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:52.560" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.680" end="00:48:57.120" style="s2">now it&#39;s interesting again is how this</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.560" end="00:49:01.830" style="s2">comes in to ancient Greece I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.120" end="00:49:05.370" style="s2">introduce you to two individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.830" end="00:49:09.500" style="s2">sort of the epitome of the axial</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.370" end="00:49:13.230" style="s2">revolution in Greece Pythagoras and</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.500" end="00:49:14.850" style="s2">Socrates you know Pythagoras of course</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.230" end="00:49:17.780" style="s2">because of an important mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.850" end="00:49:20.340" style="s2">theorem the Pythagorean theorem</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.780" end="00:49:27.150" style="s2">now Pythagoras is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.340" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">person because he seems to be people he</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.150" end="00:49:36.120" style="s2">belongs to cornfield makes this argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:39.600" style="s2">very well right Cornford mixes argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.120" end="00:49:42.390" style="s2">very well he belongs to a group a group</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.600" end="00:49:44.490" style="s2">of individuals that are around you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.390" end="00:49:47.820" style="s2">sort of just coming out of that Dark Age</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.490" end="00:49:54.870" style="s2">around 600 BCE these these individuals</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.820" end="00:49:58.020" style="s2">were called the divine man it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.870" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">clear that these men seem to represent a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.020" end="00:50:03.780" style="s2">rediscovery of shamanic psycho</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:05.670" style="s2">technologies they seem to they have a</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.780" end="00:50:07.920" style="s2">lot of associations with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.670" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">capacities for healing for flying</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.920" end="00:50:11.190" style="s2">through the air and so a lot of this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:13.320" style="s2">is legendary</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.190" end="00:50:18.020" style="s2">right it&#39;s mythological that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.320" end="00:50:23.240" style="s2">literal but Pythagoras is a real person</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.020" end="00:50:25.650" style="s2">now of course there&#39;s lots and lots of</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.240" end="00:50:27.720" style="s2">legendary material around him but the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.650" end="00:50:30.330" style="s2">legend even points towards these</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.720" end="00:50:33.420" style="s2">important aspects he seems to have gone</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.330" end="00:50:34.740" style="s2">through shamanic training he engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.420" end="00:50:37.620" style="s2">something called the Thunderstone</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.740" end="00:50:39.660" style="s2">ceremony which involved him isolating</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.620" end="00:50:42.180" style="s2">himself in a cave and going through some</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.660" end="00:50:45.720" style="s2">radical transformation and then coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.180" end="00:50:48.390" style="s2">out of it he seems to have experienced</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.720" end="00:50:51.420" style="s2">soul flight because he talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.390" end="00:50:53.990" style="s2">capacity for the psyche to be liberated</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.420" end="00:50:53.990" style="s2">from the body</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.860" end="00:51:00.390" style="s2">he was very tall and he dressed like a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.690" end="00:51:01.920" style="s2">god but no one found it offensive for</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.390" end="00:51:09.090" style="s2">him to do so at least not the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.920" end="00:51:13.170" style="s2">that followed him he discovers in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.090" end="00:51:15.030" style="s2">right he he discovers the octave he</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.170" end="00:51:18.690" style="s2">discovers that there&#39;s mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.030" end="00:51:21.780" style="s2">proportions in the world he comes to</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.690" end="00:51:24.630" style="s2">this realization that there&#39;s new psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.780" end="00:51:27.570" style="s2">technologies of rational reflection and</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.630" end="00:51:30.870" style="s2">mathematics give us access to abstract</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.570" end="00:51:35.610" style="s2">patterns that we are not directly aware</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.870" end="00:51:36.990" style="s2">of like we all take it for granted that</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.610" end="00:51:39.240" style="s2">we know what an octave is and we know</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.990" end="00:51:43.170" style="s2">there can express by ratios but that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.240" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">his discovery so what he does is he</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.170" end="00:51:51.450" style="s2">takes this idea about realizing through</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:54.060" style="s2">music and math these abstract patterns</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.450" end="00:51:54.840" style="s2">and then he links them to the project</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.060" end="00:51:59.780" style="s2">the shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.840" end="00:52:02.490" style="s2">ability to engage in self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.780" end="00:52:11.010" style="s2">he comes up with the idea that were</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.490" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">somehow trapped in this world but we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.010" end="00:52:18.350" style="s2">learn to fly above it we can fly free</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:21.990" style="s2">like the shaman but he&#39;s allied it</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.350" end="00:52:24.420" style="s2">explicitly to the actual project of self</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.990" end="00:52:29.220" style="s2">transcendence of getting in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.420" end="00:52:32.430" style="s2">the rationally realized patterns because</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.220" end="00:52:37.080" style="s2">that will liberate us that will change</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.430" end="00:52:39.030" style="s2">and transform us now Pythagoras gives us</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.080" end="00:52:41.790" style="s2">a lot of the words that we take for</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.030" end="00:52:43.560" style="s2">granted I said earlier that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.790" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">like calling the Prix axial world the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.560" end="00:52:51.180" style="s2">cosmos because Pythagoras actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.020" end="00:52:54.120" style="s2">invents this word cosmos he&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.180" end="00:52:57.660" style="s2">person to describe the universe as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.120" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">cosmos now many of you probably treat</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.660" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">those two terms as synonymous universe</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:06.390" style="s2">the one verse and cosmos they&#39;re not try</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:08.150" style="s2">to think of a word that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.390" end="00:53:13.010" style="s2">related to cosmos that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.150" end="00:53:16.510" style="s2">familiar with so the word that might not</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.010" end="00:53:21.980" style="s2">come to mind is the word cosmetic</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.510" end="00:53:25.670" style="s2">cosmetics come from cosmos what it</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.980" end="00:53:28.460" style="s2">caused medics do they right reveal the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.670" end="00:53:31.730" style="s2">beauty of things how beautiful and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.460" end="00:53:35.569" style="s2">ordered they are so Pythagoras has the</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.730" end="00:53:38.750" style="s2">idea that if we go we can use music and</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.569" end="00:53:40.910" style="s2">mathematical thinking and practices that</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.750" end="00:53:42.500" style="s2">engage in this altered state of</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.910" end="00:53:43.869" style="s2">consciousness and he is integrating them</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.500" end="00:53:47.450" style="s2">all together it&#39;s not quite clear how</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.869" end="00:53:51.829" style="s2">but what we can do is we can transcend</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.450" end="00:53:53.059" style="s2">and see the world as beautiful and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.829" end="00:53:54.349" style="s2">going to come back and talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.059" end="00:53:56.750" style="s2">how when people have awakening</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.349" end="00:54:01.480" style="s2">experiences they suddenly experience the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.750" end="00:54:01.480" style="s2">world as a cosmos as radically beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.859" end="00:54:07.910" style="s2">now remember Pythagoras because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.319" end="00:54:09.890" style="s2">gonna have a huge influence on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.910" end="00:54:11.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna talk about Plato but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.890" end="00:54:15.339" style="s2">somebody who had an even greater</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.480" end="00:54:18.619" style="s2">influence on Plato and somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.339" end="00:54:22.940" style="s2">really epitomizes the axial revolution</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.619" end="00:54:25.130" style="s2">in ancient Greece in fact he has a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.940" end="00:54:27.529" style="s2">revolution named after him this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.130" end="00:54:29.109" style="s2">called the Socratic revolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.529" end="00:54:31.839" style="s2">person we want to talk about is Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.109" end="00:54:36.470" style="s2">I&#39;m going to argue how Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.839" end="00:54:39.049" style="s2">epitomizes the Greek form of the axial</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.470" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">revolution and then what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.049" end="00:54:45.349" style="s2">do is we&#39;re going to see how Plato takes</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:49.130" style="s2">Socrates and Pythagoras and puts them</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.349" end="00:54:52.819" style="s2">together and how Socratic and platonic</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.130" end="00:54:55.329" style="s2">your cognition is how it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.819" end="00:54:58.599" style="s2">grammar of how you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.329" end="00:55:01.700" style="s2">but once again even though that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.599" end="00:55:04.279" style="s2">grammar of how we understand meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.700" end="00:55:09.079" style="s2">wisdom and what a self is and how we how</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.279" end="00:55:14.089" style="s2">we grow how we self transcend how we get</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.079" end="00:55:18.559" style="s2">in touch with reality we are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.089" end="00:55:21.140" style="s2">in the worldview of Pythagoras do we do</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.559" end="00:55:25.870" style="s2">you actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.140" end="00:55:31.330" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s seriously do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.870" end="00:55:34.040" style="s2">experience the universe as a cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.330" end="00:55:36.080" style="s2">we&#39;ll take a look at that the next time</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.040" end="00:55:37.250" style="s2">we&#39;re together thank you very much for</p>
