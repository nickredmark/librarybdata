<p begin="00:00:52.350" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">this club sprung up around the same time</p>

<p begin="00:01:54.450" end="00:02:08.400" style="s2">well thank you very much for that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:10.600" style="s2">that&#39;s quite something all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.400" end="00:02:14.050" style="s2">there&#39;s a house Mike great I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.600" end="00:02:18.430" style="s2">this one okay well then let&#39;s just move</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.050" end="00:02:19.630" style="s2">it out of the way great so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.430" end="00:02:21.990" style="s2">talk to you tonight about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.630" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">ideological nexus of post-modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.990" end="00:02:28.210" style="s2">Marxism and I want to get into it fairly</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:31.630" style="s2">deeply so you can have a thoughtful</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.210" end="00:02:35.740" style="s2">thoughtful talk and then discussion</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.630" end="00:02:37.960" style="s2">afterwards so it&#39;s a confusing topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.740" end="00:02:39.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s not obvious by any stretch</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.960" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">of the imagination why post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.970" end="00:02:44.980" style="s2">and and Neel Marxism or Marxism proper</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:47.740" style="s2">would be aligned because post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.980" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2">is an anti grand narrative philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.740" end="00:02:52.030" style="s2">movement and Marxism is a grand</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.750" end="00:02:53.980" style="s2">narrative and so the fact that those two</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.030" end="00:02:55.930" style="s2">things seem to coexist in the same space</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.980" end="00:02:58.360" style="s2">needs definitely need some explanation</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.930" end="00:03:02.650" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very tricky thing to get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.360" end="00:03:05.230" style="s2">the bottom of so we won&#39;t get to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.650" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">bottom of it but we&#39;ll get farther to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.230" end="00:03:08.890" style="s2">the bottom of it then I&#39;ve got before</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">and hopefully farther than many of you</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.890" end="00:03:12.790" style="s2">have got before so let&#39;s see what we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:16.060" style="s2">figure out here so I&#39;m gonna start with</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.790" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">some some definitions hmm I&#39;ll return to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.060" end="00:03:22.209" style="s2">them as we continue you know with</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:25.060" style="s2">philosophical movements then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.209" end="00:03:26.290" style="s2">often not named by the major thinkers in</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.060" end="00:03:29.260" style="s2">the movement they&#39;re sort of named</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.290" end="00:03:32.350" style="s2">afterwards the name covers a very large</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.260" end="00:03:34.150" style="s2">range of ideas and actions and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.350" end="00:03:36.550" style="s2">perceptions like it&#39;s not that easy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.150" end="00:03:38.260" style="s2">people talk about existentialism for</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.550" end="00:03:40.180" style="s2">example it&#39;s not that easy to come up</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.260" end="00:03:42.820" style="s2">with a one paragraph summary of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.180" end="00:03:45.700" style="s2">constitutes existentialism my sense for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.820" end="00:03:48.160" style="s2">the existentialist is that it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.700" end="00:03:50.110" style="s2">it&#39;s fundamentally a movement that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.160" end="00:03:53.470" style="s2">predicated on the idea at least in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.110" end="00:03:55.209" style="s2">this psychological sense that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.470" end="00:03:57.220" style="s2">Freud tended to attribute human</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.209" end="00:04:00.490" style="s2">suffering and mental disorder to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.220" end="00:04:02.350" style="s2">hood trauma it&#39;s more complex than that</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.490" end="00:04:04.330" style="s2">but that&#39;ll do for a for a quick</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.350" end="00:04:06.430" style="s2">overview but the existentialists thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.330" end="00:04:09.540" style="s2">that there was enough suffering</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.430" end="00:04:11.710" style="s2">intrinsic in life so that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.540" end="00:04:14.110" style="s2">insanity that was the question it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.710" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">sanity it was how was possible for</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.110" end="00:04:19.060" style="s2">people to be sane and and and and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:21.670" style="s2">say normal for lack of a better word</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.060" end="00:04:23.920" style="s2">given that there was brutality and</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.670" end="00:04:25.690" style="s2">malevolence intrinsic in life and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.920" end="00:04:29.500" style="s2">fact that you had to rise up as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.690" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">individual and and stand in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.500" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">that relationship to that is part and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:35.260" style="s2">parcel of what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:37.060" style="s2">existentialism there&#39;s all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.260" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">different people who were thinkers who</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.060" end="00:04:41.950" style="s2">were existentialist some of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:45.010" style="s2">atheistic some of them deeply religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.950" end="00:04:46.540" style="s2">like Dostoyevsky but so it&#39;s not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.010" end="00:04:49.660" style="s2">using that as an example to show you how</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.540" end="00:04:51.940" style="s2">difficult it is to bring a set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.660" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">thinkers under one umbrella you&#39;re bound</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.940" end="00:04:58.450" style="s2">to oversimplify but we&#39;ll go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.860" style="s2">oversimplify post-modernism you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.450" end="00:05:03.280" style="s2">think about it as an attitude of</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.860" end="00:05:05.140" style="s2">skepticism irony towards and rejection</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.280" end="00:05:07.570" style="s2">of grand narratives ideologies and</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.990" end="00:05:47.169" style="s2">hierarchy and the term patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.820" end="00:05:48.760" style="s2">because of course patriarchy is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.169" end="00:05:51.790" style="s2">recognition of hierarchy now it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.760" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">particular kind of recognition but the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.790" end="00:05:58.030" style="s2">post modernists also tend to define</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:06:00.490" style="s2">hierarchy as a consequence of power</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.030" end="00:06:02.140" style="s2">differential and so the world they</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.490" end="00:06:04.720" style="s2">envision as far as I can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.140" end="00:06:06.610" style="s2">something like a it&#39;s a sociological II</p>

<p begin="00:06:45.580" end="00:06:51.130" style="s2">you can actually think about Hobbes and</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.800" end="00:06:52.690" style="s2">Rousseau in some sense of as as as</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.130" end="00:06:54.340" style="s2">opposites that need to be paired</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.690" end="00:06:56.050" style="s2">together in order to get a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.340" end="00:06:59.800" style="s2">comprehensive view of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.050" end="00:07:02.229" style="s2">well the postmodern view is like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.800" end="00:07:04.419" style="s2">Hobbesian view in some sense except you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.229" end="00:07:08.830" style="s2">want to replace the individual with with</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.419" end="00:07:10.630" style="s2">with pyramids of of social organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.830" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">so hierarchies of social organization</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.630" end="00:07:15.789" style="s2">that are based on group identity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:19.300" style="s2">that the landscape in which those</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.789" end="00:07:21.760" style="s2">pyramids exist is one of unbroken enmity</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.300" end="00:07:23.470" style="s2">and inability to communicate so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.760" end="00:07:25.900" style="s2">very dark view as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.470" end="00:07:28.599" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s fundamentally wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.900" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">in many ways I mean it&#39;s right in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.599" end="00:07:33.789" style="s2">there are groups of people and there is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:36.970" style="s2">some difficulty in communication between</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.789" end="00:07:40.690" style="s2">them and that power is in the element in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.970" end="00:07:44.190" style="s2">the formation of hierarchies but you</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.690" end="00:07:47.949" style="s2">can&#39;t reduce hierarchy or group</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.190" end="00:07:50.380" style="s2">relationship to those premises it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.949" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">simplified because people also cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.380" end="00:07:55.240" style="s2">we&#39;re also not groups many many of us</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">belong to many groups so it&#39;s to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.240" end="00:08:01.479" style="s2">actual situation is far too complex to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:03.159" style="s2">reduce it to that degree to reduce it to</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.479" end="00:08:05.530" style="s2">that degree even though you can come up</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.159" end="00:08:07.930" style="s2">with a good explanatory story if you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.530" end="00:08:10.120" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t capture the nuances and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.930" end="00:08:13.300" style="s2">they&#39;re not just nuances it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">capture the essence now the thing is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.300" end="00:08:17.110" style="s2">that when you make the presupposition</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:20.020" style="s2">that the reason that hierarchies exist</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.110" end="00:08:21.820" style="s2">is because of power then essentially</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.020" end="00:08:23.610" style="s2">what you do is turn every hierarchy into</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.820" end="00:08:25.229" style="s2">a tyranny and so if you if there is</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.610" end="00:08:27.090" style="s2">hierarchy then you assume it&#39;s a tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.229" end="00:08:28.860" style="s2">well that&#39;s really the patriarchy the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.090" end="00:08:31.020" style="s2">patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.860" end="00:08:34.440" style="s2">tyranny and that&#39;s also just not true</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.020" end="00:08:36.899" style="s2">except in pathological hierarchies so</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">for example we know from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.899" end="00:08:40.849" style="s2">psychological literature that the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:43.050" style="s2">predictors of long-term life success our</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.849" end="00:08:45.300" style="s2">intelligence and conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.050" end="00:08:47.310" style="s2">in in Western countries at least well</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.300" end="00:08:49.620" style="s2">that&#39;s what you&#39;d hope for right more or</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.310" end="00:08:51.589" style="s2">less if you want it even to set up a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.620" end="00:08:54.420" style="s2">society even if you weren&#39;t particularly</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.589" end="00:08:57.450" style="s2">smart or hard-working you might want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.420" end="00:08:58.740" style="s2">set up a society where intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.450" end="00:09:00.360" style="s2">hard work we&#39;re good predictors of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.740" end="00:09:01.950" style="s2">success because then the people who were</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.360" end="00:09:03.779" style="s2">smart and hardworking would produce a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.950" end="00:09:05.490" style="s2">bunch of things that you could have if</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.779" end="00:09:07.620" style="s2">you could trade for them and of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.490" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">that is actually the situation that most</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.620" end="00:09:13.170" style="s2">of us are in so and of course the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:14.730" style="s2">thing about people who believe that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.170" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">hierarchies in the West are only</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.730" end="00:09:19.740" style="s2">composed of of power and tyranny is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:22.110" style="s2">their own actions belie that because</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.740" end="00:09:25.459" style="s2">whenever they make a decision to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.110" end="00:09:28.260" style="s2">interact with that hierarchy they</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:30.120" style="s2">attempt or to make a purchase or to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.260" end="00:09:33.329" style="s2">a trade let&#39;s say or to obtain a server</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.120" end="00:09:35.250" style="s2">a service of any importance let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.329" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">medical service they are going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.250" end="00:09:40.860" style="s2">definitely act as if there are less and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:42.660" style="s2">more competent people within that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.860" end="00:09:44.850" style="s2">hierarchy and seek out the ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.660" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">more competent obviously which you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.850" end="00:09:48.990" style="s2">do if if the hierarchy is only composed</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.570" style="s2">of tyranny and power there&#39;s no point</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.990" end="00:09:53.250" style="s2">looking for competence but anyways in</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.570" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">the West and in functioning societies</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.250" end="00:09:58.050" style="s2">the hierarchies are basically predicated</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:09:59.670" style="s2">on competence and not power and and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.050" end="00:10:02.490" style="s2">might say well that&#39;s pretty naive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.670" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">like no actually it&#39;s not very naive I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.490" end="00:10:07.050" style="s2">not saying at all that inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:09.149" style="s2">power plays don&#39;t play a role in</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.050" end="00:10:11.100" style="s2">corrupting hierarchies of competence</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.149" end="00:10:13.410" style="s2">that happens but generally what happens</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.100" end="00:10:15.000" style="s2">is if the hierarchies of competence get</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.410" end="00:10:16.290" style="s2">corrupted enough by power then they</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.000" end="00:10:19.800" style="s2">crumble because they can no longer</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.290" end="00:10:21.540" style="s2">function so and though you know the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.800" end="00:10:23.430" style="s2">evidence that our hierarchies of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.540" end="00:10:25.050" style="s2">competence work is everywhere because</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.430" end="00:10:27.209" style="s2">everything around us works all the time</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:02.570" style="s2">thing she was amazed by was that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.130" end="00:12:04.790" style="s2">could go talk to policemen and they</p>

<p begin="00:12:15.230" end="00:12:22.430" style="s2">well I won&#39;t I won&#39;t dwell on that point</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.370" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">any longer the point is is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.430" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">absolutely ridiculous blind to make the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:33.430" style="s2">assumption that the hierarchies in</p>

<p begin="00:13:08.510" end="00:13:11.300" style="s2">he wrote a book called effective</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.769" end="00:13:13.910" style="s2">neuroscience which by the way is on my</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.300" end="00:13:15.230" style="s2">reading list that&#39;s on my website it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.910" end="00:13:17.480" style="s2">really good book affective neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.230" end="00:13:19.790" style="s2">he&#39;s a great scientist he was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.480" end="00:13:21.829" style="s2">people who he learned that he learned</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.790" end="00:13:23.720" style="s2">that rats laugh they laugh out</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.829" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">ultrasonic li-like bats so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.720" end="00:13:27.769" style="s2">gonna you tickle them with a pencil</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:29.269" style="s2">eraser they laugh but you have to record</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.769" end="00:13:30.950" style="s2">it and then slow it down and then you</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.269" end="00:13:33.110" style="s2">can hear them and you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.950" end="00:13:34.820" style="s2">rats laugh like what would be a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:36.920" style="s2">grant for that what kind of idiocy is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.820" end="00:13:39.290" style="s2">that it&#39;s like no no no just don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.920" end="00:13:41.269" style="s2">don&#39;t get ahead of yourself here you</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.290" end="00:13:44.300" style="s2">know he was showing that that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.269" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">capacity for social interaction for</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.300" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">social interaction that was mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">physiological touch mmm-hmm activated</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.450" end="00:13:57.800" style="s2">the same excuse me activated the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:59.029" style="s2">circuits in rats that a dozen people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.800" end="00:14:01.850" style="s2">that those are actual biological</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.029" end="00:14:03.680" style="s2">circuits and that we share them even</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.850" end="00:14:07.730" style="s2">with rats now rats are quite similar to</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.680" end="00:14:10.510" style="s2">human beings as it turns out I could say</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.730" end="00:14:15.529" style="s2">especially post modernists but I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.510" end="00:14:17.360" style="s2">and and and so the fact that that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.529" end="00:14:18.950" style="s2">know that little rats giggle when you</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.360" end="00:14:20.860" style="s2">tickle them is is actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.950" end="00:14:26.480" style="s2">extraordinarily important he also</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.860" end="00:14:30.529" style="s2">identified surprising I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:32.690" style="s2">too much lately he also identified the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.529" end="00:14:34.760" style="s2">primary play circuit in mammals and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.690" end="00:14:36.199" style="s2">that&#39;s a big deal too from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.760" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s like discovering a</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.199" end="00:14:39.589" style="s2">new continent like discovering a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.760" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">brain system that people really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.589" end="00:14:43.089" style="s2">know existed that&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:45.350" style="s2">so here&#39;s a little story about rats so</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.089" end="00:14:46.519" style="s2">young rats like to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.350" end="00:14:48.949" style="s2">rough-and-tumble play especially</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.519" end="00:14:50.720" style="s2">juvenile males it&#39;s also the case for</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.949" end="00:14:52.640" style="s2">puppies if you&#39;ve ever had a puppy</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.720" end="00:14:55.339" style="s2">dogs are like that they like to wrestle</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.640" end="00:14:56.779" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the things that male</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.339" end="00:14:58.640" style="s2">human beings tend to do with their</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.779" end="00:15:00.620" style="s2">offspring and it&#39;s a really really good</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.640" end="00:15:02.300" style="s2">thing like rough-and-tumble play with</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.620" end="00:15:02.590" style="s2">children really help socialize them</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.300" end="00:15:04.870" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.590" end="00:15:08.590" style="s2">helps them figure out the difference</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.870" end="00:15:10.300" style="s2">between touch and even rough touch and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.590" end="00:15:11.470" style="s2">pain you know cuz one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.300" end="00:15:12.760" style="s2">you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re rough and</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.470" end="00:15:13.810" style="s2">tumble playing with the little kid is</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.760" end="00:15:14.800" style="s2">you know you throw them up in the air</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.810" end="00:15:17.140" style="s2">and you wrestle it around</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.800" end="00:15:18.730" style="s2">I built my I had two couches when my</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.140" end="00:15:20.230" style="s2">kids were little that were sort of face</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.730" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">to face so we built this little</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.230" end="00:15:23.860" style="s2">wrestling ring and I used to go in there</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:24.400" style="s2">and pound them half to death every night</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.860" end="00:15:26.740" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.400" end="00:15:28.420" style="s2">so they loved that I mean they get so</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.740" end="00:15:30.520" style="s2">excited about that they love that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.420" end="00:15:32.200" style="s2">much it&#39;s just crazy but the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.520" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">that is like you&#39;re stretching out their</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.200" end="00:15:35.980" style="s2">bodies and you&#39;re showing them that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:37.900" style="s2">can&#39;t put their thumb and your eye and</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.980" end="00:15:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re teaching them to be graceful and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.900" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">and and you&#39;re teaching them the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.760" end="00:15:43.330" style="s2">difference between something new that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">happening to the body and something</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.330" end="00:15:47.760" style="s2">painful you&#39;re really teaching them to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:50.110" style="s2">dance and it&#39;s this really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.760" end="00:15:52.510" style="s2">physiological dance that that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.110" end="00:15:54.670" style="s2">indicative of a socialized being and</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.510" end="00:15:57.160" style="s2">that&#39;s partly why women like men who can</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.670" end="00:15:58.870" style="s2">dance by the way because it seemed shows</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.160" end="00:16:00.340" style="s2">that you can pay attention to someone</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.870" end="00:16:01.990" style="s2">else first of all that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.340" end="00:16:03.550" style="s2">coordinated but even more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.990" end="00:16:05.770" style="s2">that you can take the fact of your</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.550" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">coordination and coordinate that with</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.770" end="00:16:10.510" style="s2">someone else&#39;s coordination so and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:11.830" style="s2">that&#39;s very primal and physiological</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.510" end="00:16:13.900" style="s2">it&#39;s built right into your body</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.830" end="00:16:17.530" style="s2">and rough and tumble play helps without</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.900" end="00:16:19.000" style="s2">a lot anyways rats also like to rough</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.530" end="00:16:20.980" style="s2">and tumble play for much the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.000" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">reasons and sort of sort of pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.980" end="00:16:26.140" style="s2">all social mammals so you can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:28.120" style="s2">rats like it see how do you know if a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.140" end="00:16:29.590" style="s2">rat like something well he&#39;ll work for</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.120" end="00:16:31.360" style="s2">it and one of the ways you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.590" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">out if a rat wants to work for something</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.360" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">is that no you get him in a state where</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:37.300" style="s2">maybe he&#39;s desperate for whatever he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:39.460" style="s2">working for and you can put a little</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.300" end="00:16:41.380" style="s2">spring on him and figure out how hard he</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.460" end="00:16:42.850" style="s2">pulls to go somewhere he knows where</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.380" end="00:16:44.290" style="s2">he&#39;s going to get that and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.850" end="00:16:45.520" style="s2">measure the force that he&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.290" end="00:16:47.650" style="s2">apply and that gives you a rough</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.520" end="00:16:49.870" style="s2">estimate of his motivation or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.650" end="00:16:53.110" style="s2">asked a bar press like a you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.870" end="00:16:55.240" style="s2">coke cocaine addicted rat to to receive</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.110" end="00:16:56.950" style="s2">the reward and you can count rate of bar</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.240" end="00:16:58.540" style="s2">pressing and you can get an estimate of</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.950" end="00:17:00.610" style="s2">how excited the rat is to go do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.540" end="00:17:03.010" style="s2">it is the rats going to do and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.610" end="00:17:05.709" style="s2">panksepp used to put rats</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.010" end="00:17:08.140" style="s2">he&#39;d pair them one rat against the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.709" end="00:17:12.010" style="s2">in kind of a play arena not a very big</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.140" end="00:17:14.590" style="s2">thing and and these were juvenile males</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.010" end="00:17:15.820" style="s2">and they would work to do that okay so</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.590" end="00:17:18.460" style="s2">they liked it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.820" end="00:17:20.260" style="s2">and maybe one rat was 10% bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.460" end="00:17:21.940" style="s2">the other and then when you paired them</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.260" end="00:17:24.040" style="s2">the big rat would beat the little rat</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.940" end="00:17:26.410" style="s2">because 10% weight advantage was enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.040" end="00:17:28.300" style="s2">to make the bigger dominant okay so then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.410" end="00:17:30.040" style="s2">they established basically dominance and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.300" end="00:17:31.870" style="s2">Submission you might think about that as</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.040" end="00:17:33.910" style="s2">a power relationship and to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.870" end="00:17:36.420" style="s2">it is but it&#39;s more complicated than</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.910" end="00:17:41.290" style="s2">that and this is very important so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.420" end="00:17:44.170" style="s2">the rats play together once and the big</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.290" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">rat pins the little rat really very much</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.170" end="00:17:51.640" style="s2">like wrestling those rats wrestle just</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.150" end="00:17:53.110" style="s2">like people wrestle and if you pair them</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.640" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">together then the big rat can pin the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.110" end="00:17:57.460" style="s2">little rat okay so now you got dominant</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">rats subordinate rat roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.460" end="00:18:03.160" style="s2">and but then you see if you stop the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:04.780" style="s2">experiment there you&#39;d think while the</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.160" end="00:18:07.480" style="s2">rats play to establish dominance and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.780" end="00:18:09.310" style="s2">Submission but the thing is is that rats</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.480" end="00:18:11.620" style="s2">don&#39;t just play once they play many many</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.310" end="00:18:13.360" style="s2">many times and that&#39;s also the case with</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.620" end="00:18:17.290" style="s2">human beings is that you don&#39;t just play</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.360" end="00:18:19.210" style="s2">once you play many many times and there</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.290" end="00:18:21.370" style="s2">is a difference between the rules of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.210" end="00:18:23.800" style="s2">game and the rules of a set of games and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.370" end="00:18:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s so unbelievably important so you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.800" end="00:18:27.610" style="s2">keep that mind because we&#39;ll return to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.120" end="00:18:29.560" style="s2">that so anyways the next time the two</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.610" end="00:18:31.660" style="s2">rats get together the little rat has to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.560" end="00:18:34.090" style="s2">ask the big rat to play because the rule</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.660" end="00:18:37.630" style="s2">basically is subordinate entity asks</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.090" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">dominant entity to play and so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.630" end="00:18:41.920" style="s2">little rat does what mammals do to play</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:44.380" style="s2">you know they kind of put their paws</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.920" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">down and put the rear end up bit up in</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.380" end="00:18:48.130" style="s2">the air you see dogs do that and unless</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.130" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s going for your</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.750" end="00:18:53.530" style="s2">throat means he wants you to whack him</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.540" style="s2">on the side of the head so he can sort</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.530" end="00:18:57.400" style="s2">of pretend to bite you you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.540" end="00:19:01.390" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty obvious if you&#39;ve played</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.400" end="00:19:02.830" style="s2">with dogs and children so and I make</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.390" end="00:19:04.180" style="s2">that comparison because dogs and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.830" end="00:19:06.310" style="s2">children understand each other right</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.180" end="00:19:07.810" style="s2">they&#39;re pack animals they follow the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.310" end="00:19:09.670" style="s2">same basic rules they know how to play</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.810" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">they can become friends otherwise you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.670" end="00:19:16.030" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have them as pets I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:17.770" style="s2">dogs not the children so anyways the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.030" end="00:19:19.750" style="s2">little rat asks the big rot to play and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.770" end="00:19:21.970" style="s2">the big rat things yeah yeah okay they</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.750" end="00:19:23.800" style="s2">will play they wrestle and you pair them</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.970" end="00:19:25.060" style="s2">multiple times well if you pair them</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.800" end="00:19:26.890" style="s2">multiple times what you find is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.060" end="00:19:28.360" style="s2">less the big rat lets the little rat win</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.890" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">thirty percent of the time the little</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.360" end="00:19:30.350" style="s2">rat</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:32.420" style="s2">won&#39;t ask the big rat to play anymore</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.350" end="00:19:34.250" style="s2">and that do you think well who cares</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.420" end="00:19:36.110" style="s2">what like why is that important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.250" end="00:19:37.970" style="s2">like it&#39;s really important that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.110" end="00:19:40.820" style="s2">really important discovery because it</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.970" end="00:19:43.490" style="s2">shows you that that even rats have a set</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.820" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">set a sense of fair play that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.490" end="00:19:48.080" style="s2">across iterated games it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">ever it&#39;s evidence for the biological</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.080" end="00:19:53.000" style="s2">instantiation of a social morality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:55.970" style="s2">a big deal man that&#39;s a big discovery</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.000" end="00:19:57.230" style="s2">and and it shows you that even at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.970" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">level of rats they&#39;re very social</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.230" end="00:20:03.770" style="s2">animals by the way the interactions</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.450" style="s2">between rats are are mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.770" end="00:20:07.820" style="s2">something like a sense of fairness or</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.450" end="00:20:10.250" style="s2">justice and so that&#39;s extremely cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.820" end="00:20:12.200" style="s2">because you know we tend to think of</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.250" end="00:20:13.880" style="s2">animals as having dominance hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.200" end="00:20:16.130" style="s2">and that&#39;s predicated on power and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.880" end="00:20:18.170" style="s2">idea even though the bloody postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.130" end="00:20:20.120" style="s2">is still believed in biology they extend</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.170" end="00:20:23.660" style="s2">that analogy up to human beings it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.120" end="00:20:25.550" style="s2">just not true ok well the same turns out</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.660" end="00:20:28.970" style="s2">to be true of chimpanzees so friends de</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.550" end="00:20:30.770" style="s2">Waal who&#39;s a Dutch primatologist a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.970" end="00:20:32.690" style="s2">smart one too he&#39;s been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.770" end="00:20:35.350" style="s2">the biological basis of morality as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.690" end="00:20:37.730" style="s2">and he&#39;s written a lot of good books on</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.350" end="00:20:40.220" style="s2">primate behavior chimps in particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.730" end="00:20:43.190" style="s2">chimps are brutal creatures man-like</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.220" end="00:20:45.410" style="s2">they go to war eh and so in if you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.190" end="00:20:48.230" style="s2">a chimp territory out in the jungle then</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.410" end="00:20:48.770" style="s2">the juveniles will the males in</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.230" end="00:20:50.390" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.770" end="00:20:52.730" style="s2">they&#39;ll band together in groups of four</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.390" end="00:20:55.420" style="s2">or five is often but not always a female</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.730" end="00:20:58.400" style="s2">or two with them and if they come across</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.420" end="00:21:00.500" style="s2">chimps from another troop that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.400" end="00:21:02.120" style="s2">within their hierarchy let&#39;s say they</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.500" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">will if they&#39;re if they outnumber them</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.120" end="00:21:06.350" style="s2">because they can&#39;t really count but they</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:08.810" style="s2">can estimate magnitude visually it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.350" end="00:21:10.190" style="s2">the same as counting but if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.810" end="00:21:13.370" style="s2">outnumber them they will tear them to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.190" end="00:21:15.260" style="s2">pieces and chimps are at least twice as</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.370" end="00:21:17.450" style="s2">strong as a really well developed human</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.260" end="00:21:19.340" style="s2">male and so they can tear you up pretty</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.450" end="00:21:22.340" style="s2">good and chimps are perfectly capable</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.340" end="00:21:24.380" style="s2">they hunt there they&#39;re carnivorous like</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.340" end="00:21:25.970" style="s2">human beings and they hunt they hunt</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.380" end="00:21:27.950" style="s2">colobus monkeys often they weigh about</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.970" end="00:21:30.380" style="s2">40 pounds and they&#39;ll basically eat them</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:32.450" style="s2">alive but the monkeys screaming away</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.380" end="00:21:35.270" style="s2">like mad because you know it&#39;s in pain</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.450" end="00:21:36.980" style="s2">because it&#39;s being eaten and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.270" end="00:21:38.870" style="s2">doesn&#39;t slow the chimps down a bit</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.980" end="00:21:40.429" style="s2">there&#39;s no cross species empathy</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.870" end="00:21:43.340" style="s2">stopping them from having their</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.429" end="00:21:46.460" style="s2">knack and so chimps are very brutal</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.340" end="00:21:48.619" style="s2">creatures and it isn&#39;t obvious they have</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.460" end="00:21:51.080" style="s2">a lot of internal inhibition of their</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.619" end="00:21:52.909" style="s2">aggression at all most of the inhibition</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.080" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">is Sociological it&#39;s out in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.909" end="00:21:56.090" style="s2">hierarchy and so the reason chimps</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:57.889" style="s2">aren&#39;t always aggressive with one</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.090" end="00:21:59.779" style="s2">another is because they know who can</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.889" end="00:22:01.369" style="s2">pound them and and who will gang up on</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.779" end="00:22:05.029" style="s2">them and who won&#39;t they establish their</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.369" end="00:22:06.409" style="s2">hierarchy anyways you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.029" end="00:22:08.210" style="s2">about a chimp hierarchy and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.409" end="00:22:10.190" style="s2">talking about a fairly strong and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.210" end="00:22:14.029" style="s2">aggressive creature you might think its</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.190" end="00:22:17.299" style="s2">biggest ugliest meanest most vicious</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.029" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">irritable unpleasant chimp that rises to</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.299" end="00:22:21.529" style="s2">the top well that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:23.480" style="s2">postmodernist view of human society but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.529" end="00:22:25.639" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case it happens sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.480" end="00:22:27.429" style="s2">but what happens and DeWall has</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.639" end="00:22:31.999" style="s2">documented this quite nicely is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.429" end="00:22:34.669" style="s2">tyrant chimps lead unstable regimes now</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.999" end="00:22:36.230" style="s2">you know you that might sound familiar</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.669" end="00:22:38.179" style="s2">because the same thing of course is true</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.230" end="00:22:39.950" style="s2">of human beings and why is that well</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.179" end="00:22:42.019" style="s2">it&#39;s because you know people don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.950" end="00:22:43.879" style="s2">tyrants chimps don&#39;t like them that much</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.019" end="00:22:45.769" style="s2">either and chimps are actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.879" end="00:22:47.450" style="s2">reciprocal in their social interactions</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.769" end="00:22:48.619" style="s2">so they don&#39;t just dominate each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.450" end="00:22:50.659" style="s2">they groom each other they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.619" end="00:22:52.399" style="s2">friendships they can track social</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.659" end="00:22:55.789" style="s2">relationships over very long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.399" end="00:22:58.700" style="s2">time no and and they do that and so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.789" end="00:23:00.860" style="s2">engage in in reciprocal interactions</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.700" end="00:23:02.899" style="s2">let&#39;s say pro-social in reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.860" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">interactions and you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.899" end="00:23:08.330" style="s2">what&#39;s the what&#39;s the weak point of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:10.309" style="s2">biggest ugliest toughest chimp in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.330" end="00:23:12.830" style="s2">troop and that is he doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.309" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">friends and so you know maybe he has a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.830" end="00:23:17.779" style="s2">bad day he&#39;s a little hungover whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:18.470" style="s2">from eating fermented bananas or</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.779" end="00:23:21.289" style="s2">whatever he is</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.470" end="00:23:23.570" style="s2">partying with and two of the slightly</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.289" end="00:23:25.369" style="s2">less uglies less slightly less mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.570" end="00:23:26.840" style="s2">chimps decide well this is a good time</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.369" end="00:23:30.440" style="s2">to take them out and they tear them to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.840" end="00:23:32.179" style="s2">pieces and so one of the things do all</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.440" end="00:23:33.619" style="s2">is pointed out quite nicely is that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.179" end="00:23:36.049" style="s2">you want to have a stable chimp</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.619" end="00:23:39.499" style="s2">dominance hierarchy let&#39;s call it a</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.049" end="00:23:41.090" style="s2">regime the stable ones aren&#39;t ruled by</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.499" end="00:23:44.899" style="s2">the tyrants because the tyrants get</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.090" end="00:23:47.539" style="s2">taken out by by paired up friendship</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.899" end="00:23:49.009" style="s2">dyad something like that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.539" end="00:23:52.029" style="s2">really worth thinking about too</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.009" end="00:23:52.029" style="s2">you know because</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.940" end="00:23:58.739" style="s2">because it indicates that even in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.169" end="00:24:02.200" style="s2">creatures that have less complex</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.739" end="00:24:03.789" style="s2">sociological orders and they do because</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.200" end="00:24:05.799" style="s2">one of the things that predicts how</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.789" end="00:24:07.570" style="s2">complex your social order is is how big</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.799" end="00:24:09.399" style="s2">your brain is compared to your body</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.570" end="00:24:11.470" style="s2">it&#39;s a encephalization essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.399" end="00:24:13.330" style="s2">the more encephalitis the creature the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.470" end="00:24:14.529" style="s2">larger the social groups it can track</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.330" end="00:24:16.210" style="s2">and of course human beings are very</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.529" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">highly in cephalo so we have quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.210" end="00:24:21.399" style="s2">complicated group we have quite</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:23.649" style="s2">complicated group organizations but even</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.399" end="00:24:26.440" style="s2">in simpler group organizations like the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.649" end="00:24:29.409" style="s2">chimps it isn&#39;t the tyrant who rules</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.440" end="00:24:32.889" style="s2">stabili and that turns out to be also</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.409" end="00:24:35.139" style="s2">incredibly important okay so mmm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.889" end="00:24:36.730" style="s2">so you know so much for the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.139" end="00:24:38.679" style="s2">power is the only game in town</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.730" end="00:24:41.230" style="s2">then you got to ask the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.679" end="00:24:43.480" style="s2">this is actually a postmodern question</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.230" end="00:24:46.659" style="s2">so you know get one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.480" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">Derrida said the main postmodern Joker</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.659" end="00:24:52.600" style="s2">is that by categorizing you you you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:54.730" style="s2">privilege one concept and you prep you</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.600" end="00:24:57.070" style="s2">for saw the concepts out to the margins</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.730" end="00:24:59.950" style="s2">and so he believed that when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.070" end="00:25:01.690" style="s2">constructed a hierarchy of power that</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.950" end="00:25:04.330" style="s2">the hierarchy of power privileged</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.690" end="00:25:06.100" style="s2">certain people and marginalized others</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.330" end="00:25:08.619" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s really not that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.100" end="00:25:10.779" style="s2">brilliant at observation as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.619" end="00:25:12.220" style="s2">concerned it&#39;s rather commonplace all it</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.779" end="00:25:13.960" style="s2">means is that when you categorize</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.220" end="00:25:15.460" style="s2">something that there are things that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.960" end="00:25:17.320" style="s2">in the category and a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.460" end="00:25:19.090" style="s2">that aren&#39;t and so you actually can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.320" end="00:25:20.619" style="s2">categorize anything which meant means</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.090" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">you can&#39;t perceive anything which means</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.619" end="00:25:25.659" style="s2">you can&#39;t think or live without making</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.850" style="s2">some things in the middle and everything</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.659" end="00:25:30.489" style="s2">else on the outside it&#39;s it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.850" end="00:25:32.139" style="s2">categorization itself and so maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.489" end="00:25:34.029" style="s2">post modernists would go far enough to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.139" end="00:25:36.039" style="s2">question the utility of categorization</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.029" end="00:25:38.080" style="s2">itself and I think to some degree they</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.039" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">do they do that but um</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.080" end="00:25:52.509" style="s2">the point here is is that if you you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:55.269" style="s2">asked why it is that you would if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.509" end="00:25:56.710" style="s2">were a postmodernist yourself why it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.269" end="00:25:59.019" style="s2">that you would privilege the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.710" end="00:26:00.820" style="s2">power above all else it&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.019" end="00:26:03.009" style="s2">is it that you&#39;re pushing to the margin</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.820" end="00:26:05.139" style="s2">and so that&#39;s something that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.009" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">to talk about now here&#39;s one thing you</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.139" end="00:26:09.730" style="s2">might push to the margin let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.820" end="00:26:12.970" style="s2">you believe that hierarchies are a</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.730" end="00:26:15.129" style="s2">consequence of power well then you push</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.970" end="00:26:16.509" style="s2">competence to the margin and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.129" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">applying the post moderate mark</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.509" end="00:26:21.159" style="s2">modernist logic you might say well the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:22.779" style="s2">reason your privileges so that you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.159" end="00:26:26.499" style="s2">produce so that you could push</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.779" end="00:26:27.999" style="s2">competence to the margin and so you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.499" end="00:26:29.769" style="s2">to keep that in mind too because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.999" end="00:26:31.419" style="s2">going to become important as we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.769" end="00:26:33.580" style="s2">the relationship between post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.419" end="00:26:35.320" style="s2">and Marxism maybe you&#39;re after the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.580" end="00:26:37.799" style="s2">destruction of the idea of competence</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.320" end="00:26:37.799" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.340" end="00:26:43.960" style="s2">all right so pro game postmoderns and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.820" end="00:26:45.279" style="s2">talked about it a little bit we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.960" end="00:26:49.059" style="s2">return to it now we&#39;re going to talk a</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.279" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">little bit about Marxism I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.059" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">quote here from Marx the proletarians</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:56.200" style="s2">have nothing to lose but their chains</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.580" end="00:26:58.269" style="s2">well that was pretty good for like 1880</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.200" end="00:26:59.649" style="s2">or 1890 or whenever it was he wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.269" end="00:27:01.389" style="s2">somewhere around that period of time</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.649" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">turned out the proletarians had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.389" end="00:27:04.960" style="s2">more to lose than their chains</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:07.389" style="s2">they had their lives and their families</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.960" end="00:27:10.539" style="s2">to lose and that was demonstrated amply</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.389" end="00:27:13.690" style="s2">as a consequence of the what would you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.539" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">call it the sociological movements that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.690" end="00:27:17.740" style="s2">were put into place when the marxist</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:20.919" style="s2">presuppositions began to govern</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.740" end="00:27:23.350" style="s2">societies like the soviet union so all</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.919" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">right so let&#39;s take the same post</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.350" end="00:27:29.499" style="s2">modernist approach so here&#39;s some basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:31.389" style="s2">tenets of Marxism its burgeois Xia</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.499" end="00:27:33.610" style="s2">against proletariat the version was the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.389" end="00:27:35.590" style="s2">year the capitalist the property owners</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.610" end="00:27:37.899" style="s2">those sorts of people the proletariat</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.590" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">working-class for all intents and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.899" end="00:27:43.929" style="s2">purposes the basic idea is that history</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:45.789" style="s2">itself is nothing but the what would you</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.929" end="00:27:49.049" style="s2">call it the documentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.789" end="00:27:54.129" style="s2">struggle of one class against the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.049" end="00:27:57.279" style="s2">okay no like that&#39;s wrong but it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.129" end="00:27:59.710" style="s2">because it&#39;s too simple obviously it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.279" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">obviously too simple there&#39;s all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.710" end="00:28:02.620" style="s2">of motivations that people have some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:05.490" style="s2">them are economic</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.620" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">some of them are associated with power</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.490" end="00:28:10.030" style="s2">but that&#39;s okay we&#39;ll leave that let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:11.650" style="s2">give the devil his due and say well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.030" end="00:28:12.910" style="s2">fair enough there&#39;s still a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.650" end="00:28:15.010" style="s2">tension between the haves and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.910" end="00:28:16.900" style="s2">have-nots have-nots and maybe that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.010" end="00:28:18.730" style="s2">even more intense in previous societies</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.900" end="00:28:20.770" style="s2">than it is now and it&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.730" end="00:28:22.690" style="s2">doubt that economics plays a role in in</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.770" end="00:28:24.940" style="s2">virtually everything that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.690" end="00:28:28.090" style="s2">do in a fairly significant role so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.940" end="00:28:29.680" style="s2">let&#39;s accept that as a potential theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.090" end="00:28:31.930" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s simple but maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.680" end="00:28:33.430" style="s2">practically useful and then there&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.930" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">of an offshoot of that theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.430" end="00:28:37.000" style="s2">that well if you&#39;re a Marxist that means</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:38.260" style="s2">you have sympathy for the working class</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.000" end="00:28:40.059" style="s2">right because that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.260" end="00:28:41.770" style="s2">all the time it&#39;s like well the poor</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.059" end="00:28:44.800" style="s2">working class they&#39;re all oppressed the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.770" end="00:28:46.390" style="s2">poor poor proletariat you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.800" end="00:28:48.340" style="s2">then you&#39;re also saying well we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.390" end="00:28:50.500" style="s2">good guys because we&#39;re standing on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.340" end="00:28:52.540" style="s2">side of the oppressed and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.500" end="00:28:54.250" style="s2">might also ask what your marginalizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.540" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">when you claim that you&#39;re the good guys</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.250" end="00:28:57.700" style="s2">because one of the things that you would</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:28:59.650" style="s2">be marginalizing is all of the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.700" end="00:29:02.290" style="s2">which you&#39;re not the good guys but we</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.650" end="00:29:05.020" style="s2">can leave that aside for a moment too so</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.290" end="00:29:06.790" style="s2">but there&#39;s the claims is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.020" end="00:29:09.790" style="s2">there&#39;s the working class against the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.790" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">ruling class another claim is the ruling</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.790" end="00:29:13.960" style="s2">class is the ruling class because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:16.260" style="s2">exploit the working class basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.960" end="00:29:23.620" style="s2">stealing their excess labor from them</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.260" end="00:29:26.970" style="s2">another very very what surface lis</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.620" end="00:29:30.340" style="s2">attractive claim that lacks any</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.970" end="00:29:32.050" style="s2">reasonable justification you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.340" end="00:29:34.510" style="s2">because it&#39;s predicated on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.050" end="00:29:36.760" style="s2">the world as a zero-sum game and clearly</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.510" end="00:29:38.740" style="s2">the world is not a zero-sum game so when</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.760" end="00:29:40.660" style="s2">someone creates wealth when someone is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.740" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">wealthy it can be at least at times</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.660" end="00:29:44.679" style="s2">because they created it not because they</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:46.420" style="s2">swiped it from someone else I think you</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.679" end="00:29:48.610" style="s2">know you can think of someone like Bill</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.420" end="00:29:52.540" style="s2">Gates or Steve Jobs is a good example of</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.610" end="00:29:55.540" style="s2">that you know they&#39;re there what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.540" end="00:29:57.820" style="s2">produced had a value that far exceeded</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.540" end="00:29:58.990" style="s2">what they garnered as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.820" end="00:30:01.870" style="s2">their production even though what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.990" end="00:30:03.280" style="s2">garnered was very substantial so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.870" end="00:30:05.140" style="s2">but we&#39;ll get like I said we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:07.270" style="s2">give the devil his due okay it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.140" end="00:30:09.610" style="s2">Burj huazi against the proletariat we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.270" end="00:30:13.179" style="s2">accept that it&#39;s class warfare is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.610" end="00:30:14.800" style="s2">primary historical mover no problem now</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.179" end="00:30:16.150" style="s2">but here&#39;s one I&#39;m not willing to give</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.800" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">away so easily</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.150" end="00:30:22.030" style="s2">ah we have sympathy for the working</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:24.070" style="s2">class primarily and we&#39;re good because</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.030" end="00:30:26.710" style="s2">of that no I&#39;m not going to just like</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.070" end="00:30:28.210" style="s2">give that away so simply so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.710" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">investigate that a little bit let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.210" end="00:30:33.340" style="s2">if we can actually figure out if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:36.700" style="s2">true we&#39;ll say use a pragmatic approach</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.340" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">because I&#39;m a pragmatist in that William</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.700" end="00:30:43.510" style="s2">James sense or maybe you could think</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:45.730" style="s2">about it even more deeply and anciently</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.510" end="00:30:47.350" style="s2">there&#39;s a statement in the New Testament</p>

<p begin="00:30:50.380" end="00:30:55.150" style="s2">down that road before we do that so now</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.830" end="00:30:57.280" style="s2">that&#39;s another thing you have to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.150" end="00:30:59.620" style="s2">mind before we do that I want to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.280" end="00:31:01.450" style="s2">one more detour okay so I like making</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.620" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">detours and then tangling them all back</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.450" end="00:31:06.850" style="s2">together so I want to give you a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:09.550" style="s2">a history of theories of suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.850" end="00:31:11.290" style="s2">I&#39;m going to compare the Marxist theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.550" end="00:31:13.050" style="s2">of suffering to the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.290" end="00:31:14.710" style="s2">theory of suffering and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.050" end="00:31:16.180" style="s2">judeo-christian would be and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.710" end="00:31:18.250" style="s2">I&#39;m doing that is because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.180" end="00:31:20.650" style="s2">judeo-christian theory of suffering is</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.250" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">actually one of the foundation stones of</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.650" end="00:31:25.090" style="s2">our entire culture and so it actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:28.540" style="s2">matters why you think they&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.090" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">and so the story that describes the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.540" end="00:31:32.620" style="s2">entry of suffering into the world the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:34.390" style="s2">mythological story is the story in</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.620" end="00:31:36.220" style="s2">Genesis the story of Adam and Eve and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.390" end="00:31:37.750" style="s2">basically what happens in the story of</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:39.460" style="s2">Adam and Eve is Adam and Eve are</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.750" end="00:31:41.170" style="s2">unconscious to begin with and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.460" end="00:31:43.180" style="s2">sort of in this paradisal state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.170" end="00:31:44.590" style="s2">no death or at least there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.180" end="00:31:47.920" style="s2">knowledge of death there&#39;s also no</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.590" end="00:31:50.170" style="s2">knowledge of self and then Eve eats the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.920" end="00:31:52.750" style="s2">Apple that the serpent gives her and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.170" end="00:31:55.990" style="s2">scales fall from her eyes and she gives</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.750" end="00:31:58.180" style="s2">the Apple to Adam and heats it as well</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.990" end="00:31:59.620" style="s2">so she makes him self conscious they</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.180" end="00:32:00.940" style="s2">both wake up the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.620" end="00:32:03.850" style="s2">happens is they realize that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.940" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">naked and they cover themselves up and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.850" end="00:32:06.970" style="s2">the second thing that happens as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:08.230" style="s2">consequence of that realization is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.970" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">they come to know the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.230" end="00:32:13.390" style="s2">good and evil and I mean that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:15.960" style="s2">insanely complicated story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.390" end="00:32:18.970" style="s2">dealing with a absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.960" end="00:32:20.980" style="s2">incomprehensible number of complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.970" end="00:32:23.890" style="s2">phenomena simultaneously but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.980" end="00:32:28.120" style="s2">basically goes something like this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.890" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">that to be aware that you&#39;re naked is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.120" end="00:32:32.170" style="s2">be aware of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.770" end="00:32:33.820" style="s2">agility and your mortality when when you</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.170" end="00:32:35.680" style="s2">have a nightmare about being naked in</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.820" end="00:32:38.020" style="s2">front of a crowd it means that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.680" end="00:32:40.240" style="s2">exposed to the crowd all your flaws all</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.020" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">your mortal vulnerability is exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.240" end="00:32:45.850" style="s2">the crowd for for them to see for you to</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.560" style="s2">be ashamed of for them to judge that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.850" end="00:32:49.660" style="s2">partly why we&#39;re all clothed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.560" end="00:32:51.910" style="s2">partly why human being how human why</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.660" end="00:32:53.530" style="s2">clothing is a human universal there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.910" end="00:32:55.570" style="s2">many human universals by the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.530" end="00:32:58.120" style="s2">clothing is one of them although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.570" end="00:33:00.040" style="s2">used for many different purposes so Adam</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.120" end="00:33:01.590" style="s2">and Eve cover themselves up and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.040" end="00:33:03.700" style="s2">because they&#39;ve realized that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.590" end="00:33:05.380" style="s2">that they&#39;re vulnerable they&#39;re naked</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.700" end="00:33:07.150" style="s2">and vulnerable that&#39;s self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.380" end="00:33:09.580" style="s2">human beings are self conscious animals</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.150" end="00:33:11.980" style="s2">we&#39;re really the only self conscious</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.580" end="00:33:14.380" style="s2">animals other animals have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.980" end="00:33:15.970" style="s2">glimmerings of self-consciousness some</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.380" end="00:33:18.250" style="s2">of them can identify themselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.970" end="00:33:19.920" style="s2">mirror for example but we have whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.250" end="00:33:22.870" style="s2">theories of ourselves we have whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.920" end="00:33:24.970" style="s2">articulated verbal and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.870" end="00:33:26.560" style="s2">theories of what a human being is and</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.970" end="00:33:27.970" style="s2">what we each are as individuals so</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.560" end="00:33:29.770" style="s2">really those aren&#39;t in the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.970" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">conceptual universe it&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.770" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">different it&#39;s a qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">issue in the case of human beings we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:38.770" style="s2">self conscious self consciousness loads</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:39.820" style="s2">on trait neuroticism technically</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.770" end="00:33:41.230" style="s2">speaking which means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.820" end="00:33:43.180" style="s2">self-consciousness is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.230" end="00:33:45.100" style="s2">something that manifests itself in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.180" end="00:33:46.660" style="s2">form of negative emotion and we all know</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.100" end="00:33:48.820" style="s2">that you&#39;re on stage you get</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.660" end="00:33:51.310" style="s2">self-conscious is that a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.820" end="00:33:53.080" style="s2">no you can get so self-conscious that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.310" end="00:33:54.700" style="s2">you&#39;re tongue-tied right it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:56.530" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be self-conscious on</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.700" end="00:33:58.210" style="s2">stage or maybe ever</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.530" end="00:33:59.620" style="s2">you get self-conscious in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.210" end="00:34:01.270" style="s2">face of someone you&#39;re trying to impress</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.620" end="00:34:03.070" style="s2">you turn all red you stammer</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.270" end="00:34:05.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like self-consciousness is a rough</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.070" end="00:34:07.510" style="s2">business it&#39;s no wonder because you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.290" end="00:34:09.850" style="s2">yourself for the for the fragile fool</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.510" end="00:34:12.250" style="s2">that you are it&#39;s even worse than that</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.850" end="00:34:14.530" style="s2">because see it took me a long time to</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.250" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">figure out why it was that when Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.530" end="00:34:17.740" style="s2">Eve woke up they also developed the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:19.060" style="s2">knowledge of good and evil I just</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.740" end="00:34:21.580" style="s2">couldn&#39;t figure that out because didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.060" end="00:34:23.470" style="s2">make sense to me well how self</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.580" end="00:34:25.330" style="s2">consciousness knowledge of vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.470" end="00:34:27.850" style="s2">and the knowledge of good and evil were</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.330" end="00:34:30.010" style="s2">tangled together or even really what the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.850" end="00:34:31.690" style="s2">knowledge of good and evil meant but I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.010" end="00:34:33.659" style="s2">figured it out eventually I thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.690" end="00:34:36.760" style="s2">get it I get it it was like a real</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.659" end="00:34:37.870" style="s2">revelation to me as soon as you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.760" end="00:34:39.850" style="s2">you&#39;re vulnerable you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.870" end="00:34:40.990" style="s2">difference between good and evil because</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.850" end="00:34:43.810" style="s2">as soon as you know you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.990" end="00:34:44.920" style="s2">then you know everyone else is in a suit</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.810" end="00:34:47.560" style="s2">you know that everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.920" end="00:34:50.350" style="s2">vulnerable you know how to hurt them and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.560" end="00:34:52.660" style="s2">so that means you can consciously know</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.350" end="00:34:54.370" style="s2">how to bring suffering into being and</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.660" end="00:34:56.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the knowledge of good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.370" end="00:34:57.640" style="s2">and you know that because let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.080" end="00:34:59.500" style="s2">you&#39;re really good at torturing people</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.640" end="00:35:01.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s no doubt the number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.500" end="00:35:02.680" style="s2">people in the audience who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.120" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">quite good at that and maybe you all</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.680" end="00:35:08.020" style="s2">have a bit of an affinity for it if</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:13.210" style="s2">you&#39;re married I&#39;m sure your partner</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.020" end="00:35:14.950" style="s2">would testify to that so if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.210" end="00:35:16.330" style="s2">to hurt someone what you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.950" end="00:35:18.520" style="s2">essentially is okay what would really</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.330" end="00:35:20.140" style="s2">hurt me and then you think well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.520" end="00:35:22.480" style="s2">just do that to them it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.140" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good theory</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.480" end="00:35:27.790" style="s2">it&#39;s very sophisticated so anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:29.680" style="s2">okay so what happens Adam and Eve wake</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.790" end="00:35:31.000" style="s2">up they weren&#39;t supposed to do this God</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">told them that they are gonna be sorry</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.000" end="00:35:35.910" style="s2">if they did that but they did it anyways</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:38.440" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s what people are like and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.910" end="00:35:40.690" style="s2">because we always learn things that that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.440" end="00:35:42.670" style="s2">knock us out of our present paradises</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.690" end="00:35:45.250" style="s2">right we&#39;re curious and we won&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.670" end="00:35:47.470" style="s2">things alone and maybe things are not so</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.250" end="00:35:50.050" style="s2">bad and then you you know ask some</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:51.790" style="s2">questions that maybe you&#39;re not so happy</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.050" end="00:35:53.440" style="s2">about asking once you find the answer</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.790" end="00:35:55.930" style="s2">and you fall out of your little paradise</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.440" end="00:35:59.110" style="s2">into history and you got to work to set</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.930" end="00:36:03.310" style="s2">things right again and anyways God gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.110" end="00:36:07.660" style="s2">wind of this and and he chases Adam and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.310" end="00:36:09.100" style="s2">Eve out of the Garden of Eden but he</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.660" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">says some interesting things when he</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.100" end="00:36:15.910" style="s2">chases them out he says all right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:17.410" style="s2">you know what&#39;s the consequence of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.910" end="00:36:20.620" style="s2">and he says to Adam you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.410" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">work now that&#39;s cool that&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.620" end="00:36:26.500" style="s2">well he is God after all you know also</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:28.600" style="s2">he he knows what he&#39;s talking about he</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.500" end="00:36:30.520" style="s2">says you&#39;re gonna have to work so why</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.600" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">would you have to work now that you knew</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.520" end="00:36:34.060" style="s2">you were vulnerable well the answer that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:36.250" style="s2">is well if you know you&#39;re vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.060" end="00:36:37.750" style="s2">that stretches out into the future you</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.250" end="00:36:40.510" style="s2">know you&#39;re going to die you know that</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.750" end="00:36:41.980" style="s2">you&#39;re fragile it&#39;s like maybe all your</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.510" end="00:36:43.330" style="s2">problems are solved right now you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.980" end="00:36:45.340" style="s2">sitting here you&#39;re safe you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.330" end="00:36:48.280" style="s2">hungry you don&#39;t want anything to drink</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.340" end="00:36:50.230" style="s2">etc but what about tomorrow what about</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.280" end="00:36:51.790" style="s2">next week or next month or ten years</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.230" end="00:36:53.500" style="s2">from now it&#39;s like just because you got</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.790" end="00:36:55.300" style="s2">all your problems solved for this second</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.500" end="00:36:57.029" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve got them solved for</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.300" end="00:37:00.299" style="s2">the rest of your iterate</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.029" end="00:37:02.130" style="s2">through time so you got to work and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.299" end="00:37:04.559" style="s2">work is the sacrifice of the present for</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.130" end="00:37:07.079" style="s2">the future and so that&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.559" end="00:37:08.579" style="s2">you have to work now you think see</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.079" end="00:37:10.109" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting about that this is</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.579" end="00:37:12.689" style="s2">the theory that I was going in it of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.109" end="00:37:15.239" style="s2">course God tells that Eve well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.689" end="00:37:17.459" style="s2">really you know screwed things up too</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.239" end="00:37:19.769" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have these big brain babies</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.459" end="00:37:22.799" style="s2">and and that&#39;s a big problem you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.769" end="00:37:23.999" style="s2">gonna suffer in childbirth and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.799" end="00:37:25.349" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna be dependent on you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.999" end="00:37:27.269" style="s2">forever and because of that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.349" end="00:37:28.679" style="s2">be dependent on this man that you just</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.269" end="00:37:30.539" style="s2">woke up and that&#39;s not gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.679" end="00:37:31.140" style="s2">pleasant for either of you but tough</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.539" end="00:37:34.019" style="s2">luck</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.140" end="00:37:36.509" style="s2">and so that&#39;s it that&#39;s the curse in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.019" end="00:37:38.159" style="s2">some sense and it&#39;s exactly right but</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.509" end="00:37:40.049" style="s2">the thing is there&#39;s a theory in there</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.159" end="00:37:42.269" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting theory of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.049" end="00:37:43.769" style="s2">suffering that&#39;s implicit in that story</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.269" end="00:37:45.630" style="s2">and the theory of suffering is that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.769" end="00:37:48.509" style="s2">suffering is built into this structure</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.630" end="00:37:50.939" style="s2">of self-conscious being it&#39;s built right</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.509" end="00:37:53.249" style="s2">into the structure so if you&#39;re a self</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.939" end="00:37:56.339" style="s2">conscious being that&#39;s your lot it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.249" end="00:37:58.609" style="s2">someone else&#39;s fault it isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.339" end="00:38:01.140" style="s2">consequence of sociological oppression</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.609" end="00:38:02.699" style="s2">it isn&#39;t it a consequence of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.140" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">that our society isn&#39;t organized</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.699" end="00:38:10.229" style="s2">properly it&#39;s just part of being alright</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:11.849" style="s2">so that&#39;s a big deal because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.229" end="00:38:13.589" style="s2">that&#39;s an important theory because one</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.849" end="00:38:14.909" style="s2">of the questions is well well you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.589" end="00:38:17.130" style="s2">why is there suffering what are you</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.909" end="00:38:19.589" style="s2">gonna do about it and it&#39;s a big it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.130" end="00:38:22.380" style="s2">lot different if it&#39;s just the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.589" end="00:38:24.299" style="s2">for you and if it&#39;s actually your fault</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.380" end="00:38:26.489" style="s2">that he&#39;s suffering those are or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.299" end="00:38:29.789" style="s2">it&#39;s the group&#39;s fault that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.489" end="00:38:31.559" style="s2">suffering those are major those theories</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.789" end="00:38:35.219" style="s2">are really really different than in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.559" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">second story and Cain and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.219" end="00:38:40.679" style="s2">Cain makes sacrifices to try to get it</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:43.859" style="s2">in good with God and Abel make</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.679" end="00:38:45.569" style="s2">sacrifices and the sacrifices are kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.859" end="00:38:47.159" style="s2">of archaic from our perspective they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.569" end="00:38:49.019" style="s2">burnt offerings so the smoke goes up</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.159" end="00:38:51.359" style="s2">where God can detect it because he&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.019" end="00:38:55.559" style="s2">there somewhere up there where the stars</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:56.999" style="s2">are and God rejects Cain sacrifices and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.559" end="00:38:59.009" style="s2">we don&#39;t really know why but it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.999" end="00:39:01.499" style="s2">looks like Cain is a second grader and</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.009" end="00:39:03.029" style="s2">then God Cain goes and complains to God</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.499" end="00:39:06.029" style="s2">and says like what kind of stupid</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.029" end="00:39:07.709" style="s2">universe did you make here I&#39;m breaking</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.029" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">myself in half trying to get things</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.709" end="00:39:13.110" style="s2">together making the proper sacrifices</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:16.170" style="s2">and nothing&#39;s gone well for me and Abel</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.110" end="00:39:18.210" style="s2">well you know he&#39;s everything he touches</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.170" end="00:39:20.220" style="s2">turns to gold everyone loves him he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.210" end="00:39:22.860" style="s2">even a really good guy it&#39;s like so</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.220" end="00:39:26.100" style="s2">annoying what&#39;s up with this place you</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.860" end="00:39:28.260" style="s2">built and God tells Cain don&#39;t be coming</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.100" end="00:39:30.060" style="s2">and telling me that the entire fabric of</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.260" end="00:39:33.300" style="s2">reality is wrong because it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.060" end="00:39:36.420" style="s2">working out for you says sin crouches at</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.300" end="00:39:39.090" style="s2">your door like a like a sexually aroused</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.420" end="00:39:42.090" style="s2">predatory cat that&#39;s basically the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.090" end="00:39:44.160" style="s2">metaphor that that God uses and he says</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.090" end="00:39:45.480" style="s2">and you let it in and had it and let it</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.160" end="00:39:47.880" style="s2">have its way with you</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.480" end="00:39:49.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s really an interesting way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.880" end="00:39:52.200" style="s2">putting it because what God says to Cain</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.920" end="00:39:53.910" style="s2">is that you know you&#39;re all bitter and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.200" end="00:39:55.320" style="s2">resentful and really it&#39;s no wonder</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.910" end="00:39:57.570" style="s2">because you know things aren&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.320" end="00:40:01.160" style="s2">well for you and then you&#39;ve got Abel</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.570" end="00:40:05.820" style="s2">who&#39;s over shining you in every way and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.160" end="00:40:09.150" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s your fault this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.820" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">thing waited at the door and you let it</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.150" end="00:40:14.100" style="s2">in and then you entered into a creative</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:15.960" style="s2">union with it and you produced something</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.100" end="00:40:18.450" style="s2">as a consequence and that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.960" end="00:40:20.550" style="s2">tormented spirit that you have now and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.450" end="00:40:22.710" style="s2">it&#39;s polluting your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.550" end="00:40:26.040" style="s2">reality and that&#39;s why things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.710" end="00:40:27.780" style="s2">working so out very well for you so go</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.040" end="00:40:31.290" style="s2">put yourself together before you come</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.780" end="00:40:33.930" style="s2">and tell me just exactly what&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.290" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">with the structure of reality and Cain</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.930" end="00:40:36.750" style="s2">isn&#39;t very happy about that because</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:39.330" style="s2">really is that really what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.750" end="00:40:42.210" style="s2">hear that&#39;s right like you have more</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.330" end="00:40:44.310" style="s2">misery than is necessary because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.210" end="00:40:46.710" style="s2">really didn&#39;t put your act together and</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.310" end="00:40:49.980" style="s2">you know it and you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.710" end="00:40:53.400" style="s2">creatively and so Cain goes and kills</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.980" end="00:40:55.710" style="s2">Abel that&#39;s the story of how resentment</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.400" end="00:40:58.410" style="s2">enters the world and it&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.710" end="00:41:00.990" style="s2">story in the judeo-christian canon let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.410" end="00:41:02.670" style="s2">say about actual human beings because</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.990" end="00:41:04.260" style="s2">Adam and Eve were made by God so they</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.670" end="00:41:07.350" style="s2">don&#39;t really count Cain and Abel were</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.260" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">born so that&#39;s something so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.350" end="00:41:10.530" style="s2">reaction to suffering right the</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">necessity of sacrifice and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.530" end="00:41:14.370" style="s2">consequence of the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:16.590" style="s2">sacrifice is that some sacrifices work</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.370" end="00:41:19.080" style="s2">and others don&#39;t and then if your</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.590" end="00:41:21.270" style="s2">sacrifices aren&#39;t met with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.080" end="00:41:23.520" style="s2">good will of God let&#39;s say well then</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.270" end="00:41:24.339" style="s2">that makes you angry well of course it</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.520" end="00:41:26.109" style="s2">does you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.339" end="00:41:27.759" style="s2">got out of the story if you want if</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.109" end="00:41:30.339" style="s2">you&#39;re not happy with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.759" end="00:41:32.019" style="s2">mythological or narrative statement but</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.339" end="00:41:33.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter because the</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.019" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">whole point is is that if you make</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.400" end="00:41:36.880" style="s2">sacrifices especially if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.289" style="s2">second-rate things aren&#39;t gonna go very</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:40.450" style="s2">well for you and you&#39;re gonna get bitter</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.289" end="00:41:42.849" style="s2">and resentful and murderous and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.450" end="00:41:45.640" style="s2">genocide &#39;el and it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.849" end="00:41:48.999" style="s2">you know because Cain has descendants</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.640" end="00:41:50.559" style="s2">and if you bug if you transgress against</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.999" end="00:41:51.969" style="s2">them they don&#39;t just kill you they kill</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.559" end="00:41:54.089" style="s2">seven of you and then his later</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.969" end="00:41:56.849" style="s2">descendants kill 49 of you there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.089" end="00:42:02.130" style="s2">exponential growth of murderous nasai</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.849" end="00:42:04.930" style="s2">consequence of Cain&#39;s primary primal</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.130" end="00:42:06.989" style="s2">fratricide and then the next story is</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.930" end="00:42:09.519" style="s2">the flood and that&#39;s not an accident</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.989" end="00:42:10.170" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in those stories is an</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.519" end="00:42:12.249" style="s2">accident</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.170" end="00:42:14.229" style="s2">okay so now you&#39;ve got two different</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.249" end="00:42:17.049" style="s2">theories about the nature of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.229" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the one I just laid out it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:24.009" style="s2">suffering and malevolence and you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.640" end="00:42:25.539" style="s2">the Marxist story which is well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.009" end="00:42:27.069" style="s2">oppressed people and the reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.539" end="00:42:29.259" style="s2">oppressed and suffering is because the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.069" end="00:42:31.960" style="s2">oppressors are oppressing them those are</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.259" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">not the same theories right and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.960" end="00:42:36.729" style="s2">a utopianism that&#39;s implicit in Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:38.650" style="s2">which is if you could just get the damn</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.729" end="00:42:41.559" style="s2">oppressors to stop oppressing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.650" end="00:42:44.019" style="s2">oppressed then the utopia would arrive</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.559" end="00:42:46.239" style="s2">and so not only are the oppressors</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.019" end="00:42:49.210" style="s2">responsible for the suffering of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.239" end="00:42:51.190" style="s2">poor they&#39;re also responsible for the</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.190" end="00:42:58.450" style="s2">everyone and so how reprehensible can</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.039" end="00:43:01.299" style="s2">you get well then that certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.450" end="00:43:03.369" style="s2">justifies that degree of malevolence</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.299" end="00:43:05.710" style="s2">justifies pretty much anything you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.369" end="00:43:09.509" style="s2">like to do to them so anyway so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.710" end="00:43:09.509" style="s2">take this apart in a little more detail</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.960" end="00:43:16.719" style="s2">don&#39;t do the Marxists have sympathy for</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.089" end="00:43:19.390" style="s2">the working-class George Orwell was</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.719" end="00:43:21.069" style="s2">interested in this question and so he</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.390" end="00:43:23.259" style="s2">wrote this book called Wiggin Road the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.069" end="00:43:25.269" style="s2">Whig and peer which I would highly</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.259" end="00:43:27.369" style="s2">recommend it so on a reading list I made</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.269" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s on my website you can check that</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.369" end="00:43:32.460" style="s2">out those are books that have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:35.920" style="s2">particularly influential to me and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.460" end="00:43:36.520" style="s2">Orwell was a socialist he wrote the book</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.920" end="00:43:39.670" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.520" end="00:43:42.700" style="s2">left book club which published a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.670" end="00:43:44.290" style="s2">a socialist book once a month or well by</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.700" end="00:43:50.740" style="s2">the time he wrote this book he&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.290" end="00:43:52.570" style="s2">awake you know by in the 1920s after the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.740" end="00:43:54.580" style="s2">Russian Revolution no one really knew</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.570" end="00:43:56.500" style="s2">what to make of what was happening in</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.580" end="00:43:59.800" style="s2">what would become the Soviet Union right</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.500" end="00:44:02.440" style="s2">I mean it was after World War one planet</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.800" end="00:44:07.470" style="s2">was in ashes Pro intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.440" end="00:44:10.810" style="s2">the old aristocratic order was crumbling</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.470" end="00:44:12.370" style="s2">it was a horror show and these</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.810" end="00:44:16.210" style="s2">revolutionaries came out with these new</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.370" end="00:44:17.800" style="s2">ideas and tried to give the in principle</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.210" end="00:44:19.330" style="s2">give the working class a break and</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.800" end="00:44:23.980" style="s2">everybody watched to see what would</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.330" end="00:44:26.650" style="s2">happen and the honest people and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.980" end="00:44:29.940" style="s2">intellectuals watched and I separate</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.650" end="00:44:32.140" style="s2">them for a reason but by nineteen twenty</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.940" end="00:44:32.530" style="s2">twenty-one twenty-two something like</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.140" end="00:44:34.930" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.530" end="00:44:36.190" style="s2">it was obvious already that something</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.930" end="00:44:38.080" style="s2">was rotten in the state of Denmark</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.190" end="00:44:39.910" style="s2">Malcolm Muggeridge went over to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.080" end="00:44:42.130" style="s2">Soviet Union to check out how the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.910" end="00:44:43.660" style="s2">collectivization of the farms was going</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.130" end="00:44:46.840" style="s2">and he found out it was actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.660" end="00:44:48.700" style="s2">murderous right because what this what</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.840" end="00:44:50.320" style="s2">the communists did was round up all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.700" end="00:44:51.700" style="s2">successful farmers and raped them and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.320" end="00:44:53.800" style="s2">kill them and steal everything they had</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.700" end="00:44:55.300" style="s2">and send them off to Siberia which</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.800" end="00:44:58.360" style="s2">turned out actually to be a pretty bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.300" end="00:45:01.090" style="s2">idea now you think you think about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.360" end="00:45:03.070" style="s2">those people were or serfs not very long</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.090" end="00:45:05.260" style="s2">before a couple of generations at most</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.070" end="00:45:07.450" style="s2">they were so not much more than slaves</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.260" end="00:45:08.710" style="s2">and some of them had risen up to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.450" end="00:45:10.450" style="s2">point where the me had a nice brick</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.710" end="00:45:12.220" style="s2">house and a couple of cows and maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.450" end="00:45:14.400" style="s2">person working for them or two and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.220" end="00:45:16.380" style="s2">was a small proportion of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.400" end="00:45:18.580" style="s2">agriculturalists in the soviet union</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.380" end="00:45:20.380" style="s2">that we&#39;re producing most of the food</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.580" end="00:45:22.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s just how it goes because</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.380" end="00:45:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a preeto distribution issue in</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.300" end="00:45:26.830" style="s2">any field where there&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.120" end="00:45:28.750" style="s2">productivity a small proportion of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.830" end="00:45:30.670" style="s2">people produce almost all of the output</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.750" end="00:45:32.110" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the square root of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.670" end="00:45:33.820" style="s2">number of people in the field produce</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.110" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">half the output so if you have a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.820" end="00:45:37.090" style="s2">farmers ten of them produce half the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.380" end="00:45:38.940" style="s2">food but if you have ten thousand a</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.090" end="00:45:41.350" style="s2">hundred of them produce half the food</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.940" end="00:45:44.890" style="s2">okay so what happens when you kill all</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.350" end="00:45:48.730" style="s2">the good farmers you starve six million</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.890" end="00:45:50.050" style="s2">Ukrainians to death in the 1930s and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.730" end="00:45:50.350" style="s2">know that&#39;s not something that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.050" end="00:45:54.100" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.350" end="00:45:55.870" style="s2">widely known but if you want to provide</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.100" end="00:45:57.940" style="s2">some additional fodder for your</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.870" end="00:45:59.500" style="s2">nightmares you could go online and read</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.940" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">about what happened to the Ukrainians in</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.500" end="00:46:05.590" style="s2">the 1930s so without underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:07.090" style="s2">under the collectivization principles so</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.590" end="00:46:08.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re a mother and you were</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.090" end="00:46:11.230" style="s2">starving to death and so are your</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.680" end="00:46:13.390" style="s2">children and you know the Communists had</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.230" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">come in and forcibly collectivized you</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.390" end="00:46:16.840" style="s2">and then they took all the grain that</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:18.280" style="s2">your collective farm had produced and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.840" end="00:46:20.410" style="s2">they shipped it all to the city saying</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.280" end="00:46:22.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s all done and you think ok you</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.410" end="00:46:25.630" style="s2">know the city&#39;s gotta eat and so then</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.120" end="00:46:27.730" style="s2">you go out in the field to pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.630" end="00:46:29.080" style="s2">grains that the harvesters missed so</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:30.790" style="s2">that you can you know the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.080" end="00:46:32.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been lying there they&#39;re not so</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.790" end="00:46:34.660" style="s2">good there&#39;s not that many of them you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.680" end="00:46:37.930" style="s2">go out and glean you pick up the seeds</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.660" end="00:46:40.330" style="s2">that weren&#39;t picked up so you can feed</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.930" end="00:46:42.750" style="s2">your kids so they don&#39;t die and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.330" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the punishment for that death</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.750" end="00:46:47.310" style="s2">because you were obliged under the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:49.420" style="s2">collectivization orders to turn in any</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.310" end="00:46:52.000" style="s2">additional grains that you happen to</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.420" end="00:46:55.210" style="s2">pick off the ground to the authorities</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.000" end="00:46:56.830" style="s2">so that they could be well who knows but</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.210" end="00:46:58.690" style="s2">at least so you so they could be shipped</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.830" end="00:47:00.340" style="s2">to the cities I suppose which is of</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.690" end="00:47:02.620" style="s2">course absurd because of course that</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.340" end="00:47:06.540" style="s2">would never happen but it was mostly so</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.620" end="00:47:09.160" style="s2">that you could just actually die so ok</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.540" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">anyways back to the road to Wigan pier</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.160" end="00:47:18.910" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna read you a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:21.820" style="s2">about about from the book so Orwell went</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.910" end="00:47:26.410" style="s2">out to this mining town in the northern</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.820" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">UK and coal miners or will had sympathy</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.410" end="00:47:29.310" style="s2">for the working class he really worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:33.850" style="s2">on that his whole life because he was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.310" end="00:47:37.630" style="s2">middle class upper middle class snobby</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.850" end="00:47:40.150" style="s2">type Englishman and he knew it and he</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.630" end="00:47:43.000" style="s2">tried really hard to overcome that he he</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.150" end="00:47:45.100" style="s2">he served in the Spanish Civil War he</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.000" end="00:47:47.410" style="s2">wandered around as a he worked in</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.100" end="00:47:49.300" style="s2">in in low end restaurant he worked as a</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.300" end="00:47:53.380" style="s2">and and in London he has a very good</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:55.750" style="s2">book I think it&#39;s called down and out in</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.380" end="00:47:58.180" style="s2">Paris in London that describes that he</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.750" end="00:48:00.760" style="s2">was seriously committed dude and really</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.180" end="00:48:03.630" style="s2">a smart guy and so he&#39;s going up to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.760" end="00:48:05.550" style="s2">these terrible towns</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.630" end="00:48:07.380" style="s2">in the northern UK where the coal miners</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.550" end="00:48:10.230" style="s2">worked and have their families and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.380" end="00:48:12.990" style="s2">know they had hard lives they had hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.230" end="00:48:15.810" style="s2">lives and that&#39;s just saying nothing you</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.990" end="00:48:17.190" style="s2">know that coal miners that he met they</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.810" end="00:48:20.280" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any teeth by the time they</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.190" end="00:48:22.140" style="s2">were thirty he said the women he talked</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.280" end="00:48:23.640" style="s2">you said teeth are just a misery it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.140" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">better to get rid of them as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.640" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">can and and and they went and the man</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:31.350" style="s2">went and mine coal and that was rough</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.360" style="s2">you know they all have black lung by the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.350" end="00:48:36.570" style="s2">time they were 40 and they were they</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.360" end="00:48:38.400" style="s2">were done fundamentally but here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.570" end="00:48:41.130" style="s2">just a bit a bit of a story about how</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.400" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">hard their lives were so they had to go</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.130" end="00:48:45.900" style="s2">in the mines during the day so they</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">never saw the day so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.900" end="00:48:49.290" style="s2">they had to go to the mines and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:52.200" style="s2">they had their like not coal off the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.290" end="00:48:53.850" style="s2">walls that&#39;s hard with hammers and picks</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.200" end="00:48:56.340" style="s2">and all of that and they had to move it</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.850" end="00:48:58.680" style="s2">but that was that was their job but</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.340" end="00:49:00.300" style="s2">there was the commute so here was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.680" end="00:49:02.250" style="s2">commute so imagine that the typical</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.300" end="00:49:04.320" style="s2">tunnel was about that high something</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.250" end="00:49:06.600" style="s2">like that and the typical coal miner was</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.320" end="00:49:07.680" style="s2">about that high that&#39;s a problem eh</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.600" end="00:49:09.330" style="s2">because you got to walk through those</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:11.610" style="s2">tunnels to get to work so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.330" end="00:49:13.530" style="s2">walk like this then the question might</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.610" end="00:49:15.570" style="s2">be well how far do you have to walk to</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.530" end="00:49:18.120" style="s2">work and the answer is three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.570" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">miles and that&#39;s how far you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.120" end="00:49:22.200" style="s2">walk back from work after you put your</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.870" style="s2">eight-hour shift in at the coal mine and</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.200" end="00:49:27.540" style="s2">they don&#39;t get paid for the commute and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.870" end="00:49:30.540" style="s2">so huh or well said that was more or</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.540" end="00:49:32.100" style="s2">less like climbing a small mountain in</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.540" end="00:49:33.960" style="s2">the morning before you went to work and</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.100" end="00:49:36.510" style="s2">then climbing another one at night</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.960" end="00:49:38.940" style="s2">before you went home and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.510" end="00:49:40.740" style="s2">just I mean believe me I&#39;m telling you</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.940" end="00:49:42.300" style="s2">very little about how tough their lives</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.740" end="00:49:44.490" style="s2">were but that gives you a little flavor</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.300" end="00:49:46.500" style="s2">like some one day like that for a modern</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.490" end="00:49:49.890" style="s2">person you&#39;re just your dad or you wish</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.500" end="00:49:52.470" style="s2">you were dead anyways and so Orwell</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.890" end="00:49:54.930" style="s2">talks about going up there to stay and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.470" end="00:49:56.250" style="s2">terrible places he lived in while he was</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.930" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">up there and the terrible food he ate</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.250" end="00:50:00.060" style="s2">and and the miserable wretched scenes</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:01.890" style="s2">that he saw and here&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.060" end="00:50:04.950" style="s2">miserable wretched scenes he&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.890" end="00:50:07.590" style="s2">train through the neighborhoods he says</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.950" end="00:50:09.720" style="s2">the Train bore me away through the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.590" end="00:50:12.720" style="s2">monstrous scenery of slag heaps chimneys</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.720" end="00:50:15.270" style="s2">piled scrap iron fouled canals paths of</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.720" end="00:50:17.190" style="s2">Sindri mud crisscross by the prints of</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.270" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">clogs this was March</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.190" end="00:50:21.480" style="s2">but the weather had been horribly cold</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:24.599" style="s2">and everywhere there were mounds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">black and snow as we move slowly through</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.599" end="00:50:29.130" style="s2">the outskirts of the town we passed row</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:30.780" style="s2">after row of little gray slum houses</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.130" end="00:50:33.750" style="s2">running at right angles to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.780" end="00:50:35.400" style="s2">embankment at the back of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.750" end="00:50:37.829" style="s2">houses a young woman was kneeling on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.400" end="00:50:39.750" style="s2">stones poking a stick up the lead and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.829" end="00:50:42.390" style="s2">waste pipe which ran from the sink</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.750" end="00:50:45.089" style="s2">inside in which I suppose was blocked I</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.390" end="00:50:48.089" style="s2">had time to see everything about her her</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.089" end="00:50:49.819" style="s2">sac apron her clumsy clogs her arms</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.089" end="00:50:52.920" style="s2">reddened by the cold</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.819" end="00:50:54.859" style="s2">she looked up as the train passed and I</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.920" end="00:50:58.079" style="s2">was almost near enough to catch her eye</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.859" end="00:51:00.750" style="s2">she had a round pale face the usual</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.079" end="00:51:02.789" style="s2">exhausted face of the slum girl who&#39;s 25</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.750" end="00:51:05.490" style="s2">and looks 40 thanks to miscarriages and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.789" end="00:51:07.289" style="s2">drudgery and at war for the second in</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.490" end="00:51:11.339" style="s2">which I saw it the most desolate</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.289" end="00:51:13.650" style="s2">hopeless expression I&#39;ve ever seen it</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.339" end="00:51:15.510" style="s2">struck me then that we meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.650" end="00:51:17.520" style="s2">middle class at that time our mistake</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.510" end="00:51:20.039" style="s2">and when we say that it isn&#39;t the same</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.520" end="00:51:21.660" style="s2">for them as it would be for us and the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.039" end="00:51:24.150" style="s2">people bred in the slums can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.660" end="00:51:26.099" style="s2">nothing but the slums for what I saw on</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.150" end="00:51:28.170" style="s2">her face was by no means the ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.099" end="00:51:29.539" style="s2">suffering of an animal she knew well</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.170" end="00:51:31.440" style="s2">enough what was happening to her</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.539" end="00:51:33.450" style="s2">understood as well as I did</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.440" end="00:51:35.369" style="s2">how dreadful a destiny it was to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.450" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">kneeling there in the bitter cold on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.369" end="00:51:43.279" style="s2">slimy stones of a slum backyard poking a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:47.579" style="s2">stick up a followed drainpipe all right</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.279" end="00:51:49.980" style="s2">so Thor well rates the first part of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.579" end="00:51:52.770" style="s2">book and it details the lives of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.980" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">people and then he makes an argument he</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.770" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2">says like how can you read about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:52:01.230" style="s2">how can you know about this without</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:52:03.980" style="s2">having some sympathy for redistribution</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.230" end="00:52:06.690" style="s2">schemes and social and socialist ideas</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.980" end="00:52:08.309" style="s2">and so he&#39;s actually asking himself this</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.690" end="00:52:10.710" style="s2">question it&#39;s not just a rhetorical</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.309" end="00:52:12.390" style="s2">question he&#39;s I mean he&#39;s a serious guy</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.710" end="00:52:14.940" style="s2">right he went he goes up there and he</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.390" end="00:52:17.039" style="s2">tells you a story that you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.940" end="00:52:18.270" style="s2">a heart of stone if you if you don&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.039" end="00:52:19.740" style="s2">you read that you don&#39;t think man</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.270" end="00:52:20.700" style="s2">something should be done about this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.740" end="00:52:25.260" style="s2">really awful</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.700" end="00:52:27.150" style="s2">so he&#39;s set up this situation where your</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.260" end="00:52:30.470" style="s2">sympathies are completely with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.150" end="00:52:30.470" style="s2">people that he&#39;s describing</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.779" end="00:52:35.689" style="s2">but socialism wasn&#39;t all that popular in</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.640" end="00:52:37.709" style="s2">Britain at that time and and so and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.689" end="00:52:39.929" style="s2">socialists weren&#39;t all that popular with</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.709" end="00:52:44.269" style="s2">Orwell didn&#39;t really like them that much</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.929" end="00:52:44.269" style="s2">he was trying to figure out why that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.650" end="00:52:49.109" style="s2">so this is what he wrote in the second</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.789" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">part of the book now this got him in a</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.109" end="00:52:53.130" style="s2">lot of trouble they didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:57.779" style="s2">publish his damn book after he wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.130" end="00:52:59.400" style="s2">second part but he fought with them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.779" end="00:53:01.229" style="s2">he got it published and it&#39;s a classic</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.400" end="00:53:02.549" style="s2">and and people still read it and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.229" end="00:53:05.429" style="s2">should read it because it&#39;s a great book</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.549" end="00:53:07.339" style="s2">and Orwell&#39;s a great writer and Orwell</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.429" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">is another one of those people that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.339" end="00:53:12.359" style="s2">intellectuals who woke up pretty early</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:16.799" style="s2">in all Orwell wrote Animal Farm in 1984</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.359" end="00:53:18.829" style="s2">he wrote 1984 and 1948 wrote Animal Farm</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.799" end="00:53:21.359" style="s2">approximately around the same time he</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.829" end="00:53:24.989" style="s2">knew what was happening under Stalin and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.359" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t afraid to say it but it was a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.989" end="00:53:29.099" style="s2">message that in some sense fell on deaf</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:31.229" style="s2">ears especially among the intelligentsia</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.099" end="00:53:34.739" style="s2">and there was complicated reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.229" end="00:53:36.299" style="s2">that but but it wasn&#39;t like the facts</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.739" end="00:53:38.009" style="s2">weren&#39;t there for people to see them if</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.299" end="00:53:39.539" style="s2">they wanted to and has already said</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.009" end="00:53:41.849" style="s2">Muggeridge Malcolm Muggeridge had made</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.539" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">it pretty clear in the 1920s and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.849" end="00:53:45.269" style="s2">was widely publicized by the way</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:47.729" style="s2">throughout the UK what was happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.269" end="00:53:50.579" style="s2">during decolonization the cool Acts</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.729" end="00:53:53.369" style="s2">being the farmers that I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.579" end="00:53:56.390" style="s2">earlier who who had committed the</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.369" end="00:53:58.890" style="s2">unspeakable sin of crawling out of their</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.390" end="00:54:00.449" style="s2">serfs status over a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.890" end="00:54:04.249" style="s2">generations to the point where they</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.449" end="00:54:07.619" style="s2">weren&#39;t mere property and half starved</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.249" end="00:54:12.719" style="s2">so this is what Orwell had to say about</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.619" end="00:54:15.539" style="s2">Socialists it might be said however that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.719" end="00:54:18.299" style="s2">even if the theoretical oriented book</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.539" end="00:54:21.390" style="s2">trained socialist is not a working man</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.299" end="00:54:22.979" style="s2">himself at least he is actuated by a</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.390" end="00:54:25.199" style="s2">love of the working class</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.979" end="00:54:26.789" style="s2">he&#39;s endeavoring to shed his burgeois</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.199" end="00:54:29.429" style="s2">status and fight on the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.789" end="00:54:34.259" style="s2">proletariat obviously that must be his</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.429" end="00:54:37.409" style="s2">motive but is it sometimes I look at a</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.259" end="00:54:39.869" style="s2">socialist the intellectual tract writing</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.409" end="00:54:42.569" style="s2">type of socialist with his pull over his</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.869" end="00:54:44.579" style="s2">fuzzy hair and his Marxist quotation and</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.569" end="00:54:47.039" style="s2">wonder what the devil is motive</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.579" end="00:54:49.439" style="s2">it&#39;s really difficult to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.039" end="00:54:51.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a love of anybody especially of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.439" end="00:54:55.289" style="s2">working class from whom he is of all</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.239" end="00:54:56.670" style="s2">people the furthest removed the truth is</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.289" end="00:54:59.009" style="s2">that too many people calling them</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.670" end="00:55:01.709" style="s2">socialists revolution does not mean a</p>

<p begin="00:57:45.090" end="00:57:48.600" style="s2">should be pretty happy about that but we</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.160" end="00:57:52.190" style="s2">should also remember at least to some</p>

<p begin="00:57:52.190" end="00:58:01.740" style="s2">so as far as I&#39;m concerned the working</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.800" end="00:58:04.730" style="s2">class needs a voice and it isn&#39;t obvious</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.740" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">that they have one at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.730" end="00:58:13.440" style="s2">having said that however it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:15.740" style="s2">obvious to me at all that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.440" end="00:58:19.980" style="s2">purport to stand for the working class</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.740" end="00:58:21.570" style="s2">actually do so or that if they do so</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.980" end="00:58:22.740" style="s2">that the reason they do so is because</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.570" end="00:58:24.630" style="s2">they&#39;re all compassionate and</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.740" end="00:58:28.070" style="s2">sympathetic and loving and kind and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.630" end="00:58:32.220" style="s2">saint-like I&#39;m more convinced by</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.070" end="00:58:35.180" style="s2">Orwell&#39;s argument so back to the NDP the</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.220" end="00:58:37.290" style="s2">people I met at the leadership level a</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.180" end="00:58:40.170" style="s2">lot of them I had a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.290" end="00:58:41.780" style="s2">admiration for but as I worked with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.170" end="00:58:44.310" style="s2">party over about a five year period</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.780" end="00:58:46.620" style="s2">there is this contradiction that came</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.310" end="00:58:48.300" style="s2">kept emerging for me and that was that I</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.620" end="00:58:50.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t really like the low-level party</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.300" end="00:58:52.440" style="s2">functionary activist types like they</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.310" end="00:58:55.140" style="s2">just weren&#39;t personally appealing to me</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.440" end="00:58:57.840" style="s2">they seemed peevish and resentful and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.140" end="00:59:01.110" style="s2">then at the same time I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.840" end="00:59:02.580" style="s2">college I was about 17 I got elected to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.110" end="00:59:05.280" style="s2">the sit on the College Board of</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.580" end="00:59:07.830" style="s2">Governors and at that time Alberta was</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.280" end="00:59:10.560" style="s2">conservative politically right it still</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.830" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">is of course but the it was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.560" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">Progressive</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.340" end="00:59:20.100" style="s2">empire because they ruled Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.340" end="00:59:22.170" style="s2">forever and all the board of governor</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.100" end="00:59:23.490" style="s2">members were basically nominees right</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.170" end="00:59:25.650" style="s2">they were conservative nominees so these</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.490" end="00:59:28.260" style="s2">were conservative people and I was an</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.650" end="00:59:29.730" style="s2">MVP member and I thought when I&#39;d worked</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.260" end="00:59:31.800" style="s2">for small businessman too who weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.730" end="00:59:33.210" style="s2">NDP they were they were conservative he</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.800" end="00:59:36.090" style="s2">can never figure that out but I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.210" end="00:59:37.950" style="s2">you about that in a minute but I had a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.090" end="00:59:39.360" style="s2">bad case of cognitive dissonance because</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.950" end="00:59:40.860" style="s2">they actually turned out that I admired</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.360" end="00:59:42.660" style="s2">the people on the Board of Governors and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.860" end="00:59:44.190" style="s2">they were mostly it was in Grand Prairie</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.660" end="00:59:47.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not a very big place and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.190" end="00:59:49.230" style="s2">very old and so if you were reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.270" end="00:59:51.060" style="s2">successful in Grand Prairie the</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.230" end="00:59:52.800" style="s2">probability that you would inherited</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.060" end="00:59:55.380" style="s2">your money from the Rs 2 crore</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.800" end="00:59:57.540" style="s2">aristocracy was like zero because there</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.380" end="01:00:00.080" style="s2">wasn&#39;t one write it the whole damn town</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.540" end="01:00:03.090" style="s2">was 50 years old so if you had any</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.080" end="01:00:04.650" style="s2">influencer or wealth you were a small</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.090" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">businessmen small to middle sized</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.650" end="01:00:10.170" style="s2">businessman and you&#39;d you knew what you</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:12.060" style="s2">were doing and I actually admired these</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.170" end="01:00:14.610" style="s2">people I thought well that&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.060" end="01:00:15.780" style="s2">good I admire them and I don&#39;t share</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.610" end="01:00:16.890" style="s2">their political views and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.780" end="01:00:18.870" style="s2">these other people with whom I</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.890" end="01:00:21.390" style="s2">hypothetically sure political views and</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.870" end="01:00:23.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t admire them at all what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.390" end="01:00:28.620" style="s2">on and then I read road to Whig and peer</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.040" end="01:00:31.820" style="s2">and I thought oh that&#39;s it they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.620" end="01:00:35.070" style="s2">like the poor they just hate the rich</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.820" end="01:00:37.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same thing it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.070" end="01:00:39.960" style="s2">same set of motivations and so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.830" end="01:00:42.530" style="s2">that you&#39;re a post modernist and you</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.960" end="01:00:44.310" style="s2">privilege compassion for the oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.530" end="01:00:47.370" style="s2">think well what do you push to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.310" end="01:00:50.340" style="s2">margins well what are you doing with all</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.370" end="01:00:52.050" style="s2">your hatred and your resentment and your</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.340" end="01:00:57.510" style="s2">evil it&#39;s like you don&#39;t have any of</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.050" end="01:01:01.980" style="s2">that that&#39;s a bad theory that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.510" end="01:01:04.740" style="s2">bad theory okay so fine so you can say</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.980" end="01:01:06.990" style="s2">well yeah you can say that but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.740" end="01:01:09.960" style="s2">buy it I still think that the people who</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.990" end="01:01:11.820" style="s2">stand to speak for the oppressed or in</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.960" end="01:01:14.430" style="s2">fact motivated by empathy and sympathy</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.820" end="01:01:16.230" style="s2">their hearts are in the right place see</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.430" end="01:01:17.580" style="s2">I don&#39;t really buy that either because I</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.230" end="01:01:21.450" style="s2">don&#39;t really think generally speaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.580" end="01:01:23.610" style="s2">that it&#39;s a credible claim for someone</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.450" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">to make that their heart is in the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.610" end="01:01:27.579" style="s2">place now</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:28.839" style="s2">you can ask that of yourself and if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.579" end="01:01:32.289" style="s2">think your heart is in the right place</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.839" end="01:01:38.910" style="s2">well more power to you you know I I I</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.289" end="01:01:41.589" style="s2">can&#39;t see the halo from here however and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.910" end="01:01:44.950" style="s2">so given that you&#39;re just as malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.589" end="01:01:47.229" style="s2">as your neighbor or maybe even more so</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.950" end="01:01:50.109" style="s2">and that that&#39;s actually pretty</p>

<p begin="01:02:29.979" end="01:02:35.229" style="s2">give those people some power and if</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.759" end="01:03:15.130" style="s2">Nietzsche said back in the eighteen late</p>

<p begin="01:03:15.130" end="01:03:19.509" style="s2">dead and I suppose that would also mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.710" end="01:03:21.880" style="s2">the theory that of suffering that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.509" end="01:03:23.289" style="s2">outlined at the beginning that is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.880" end="01:03:25.779" style="s2">the basis of judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.289" end="01:03:27.849" style="s2">civilization that God was dead and that</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.779" end="01:03:29.710" style="s2">people had killed him and that we&#39;d</p>

<p begin="01:03:32.589" end="01:03:38.640" style="s2">message right and he also said there&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.900" end="01:03:39.950" style="s2">be two consequences of that nihilism</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.640" end="01:03:41.869" style="s2">because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:03:43.730" end="01:03:49.609" style="s2">tolerate nihilism they said the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.300" end="01:03:52.760" style="s2">likely pathway to totalitarianism would</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.609" end="01:03:56.650" style="s2">be communism essentially he didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.760" end="01:03:59.920" style="s2">use those words but he meant that he</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.650" end="01:04:02.540" style="s2">they words are close enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.920" end="01:04:04.220" style="s2">he said socialism but I&#39;m going to use</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.540" end="01:04:06.170" style="s2">communism to distinguish in it</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.220" end="01:04:08.690" style="s2">distinguish it from democratic socialism</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.170" end="01:04:10.430" style="s2">and he said that probably tens of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.690" end="01:04:12.050" style="s2">hundreds of millions of people would die</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.430" end="01:04:14.089" style="s2">in the 20th century as we played out</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.050" end="01:04:15.589" style="s2">that experiment and then he said but it</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.089" end="01:04:18.980" style="s2">might be worth it if we learn something</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.589" end="01:04:21.560" style="s2">from it rough man</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.980" end="01:04:23.240" style="s2">I mean and and unbelievable like I</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.560" end="01:04:24.640" style="s2">cannot figure out how in the world he</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.240" end="01:04:26.810" style="s2">knew that that was going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.640" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">especially so far in advance but</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.810" end="01:04:30.560" style="s2">Dostoyevsky knew the same thing he wrote</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:33.320" style="s2">this book called the Devils or the</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.560" end="01:04:35.089" style="s2">possessed you could read that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.320" end="01:04:36.619" style="s2">great book it takes about a hundred and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.089" end="01:04:39.230" style="s2">fifty pages to get going</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.619" end="01:04:41.660" style="s2">but once it like everything everything</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.230" end="01:04:44.540" style="s2">snaps together after that you know and</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.660" end="01:04:47.150" style="s2">then it moves and it&#39;s basically his</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.540" end="01:04:49.940" style="s2">prophecy about it&#39;s an examination of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.150" end="01:04:52.250" style="s2">the kind of person who had arisen in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.940" end="01:04:54.770" style="s2">aftermath of the death of God in Russia</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.250" end="01:04:57.079" style="s2">who would lead the Communist revolution</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.770" end="01:04:59.690" style="s2">that&#39;s essentially it it&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.079" end="01:05:02.089" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s terrifying and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.690" end="01:05:04.280" style="s2">great intro to Solzhenitsyn&#39;s Gulag</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.089" end="01:05:06.650" style="s2">Archipelago which describes what did</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.280" end="01:05:09.410" style="s2">happen when those sort of people took</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.650" end="01:05:11.300" style="s2">over the revolution so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.410" end="01:05:13.550" style="s2">what happened after the revolution and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.300" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">we might say well this how about we</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.550" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">replicate the experiment a few times</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:19.400" style="s2">because you know how it is if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.119" end="01:05:22.190" style="s2">running a scientific experiment you want</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.400" end="01:05:24.500" style="s2">to find out what something does if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.190" end="01:05:26.540" style="s2">allow it to behave you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.500" end="01:05:28.099" style="s2">just run it once because well maybe</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.540" end="01:05:30.200" style="s2">there was something specific about those</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.099" end="01:05:32.859" style="s2">conditions that led to the outcome you</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.200" end="01:05:35.030" style="s2">want to generalize it across multiple</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.859" end="01:05:40.220" style="s2">circumstances so we might say well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.030" end="01:05:42.050" style="s2">take this set of ideas and let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.220" end="01:05:43.550" style="s2">run it on a large scale over a very long</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.050" end="01:05:45.710" style="s2">period of time in a variety of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.550" end="01:05:52.520" style="s2">exceptionally diverse cultures and</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.710" end="01:05:53.539" style="s2">languages so let&#39;s do that okay well we</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.520" end="01:05:58.130" style="s2">could first start</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.539" end="01:06:00.019" style="s2">with the with the Soviets people even</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.130" end="01:06:01.880" style="s2">now because it&#39;s like the hundredth</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.019" end="01:06:04.489" style="s2">anniversary of the Russian Revolution or</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.880" end="01:06:04.999" style="s2">celebrating Lenin it&#39;s like that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.489" end="01:06:08.719" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.999" end="01:06:11.959" style="s2">that&#39;s like celebrating Hitler okay I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.719" end="01:06:14.899" style="s2">dead serious about that it&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.959" end="01:06:17.089" style="s2">and the fact that people can dare to</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.899" end="01:06:18.559" style="s2">think that that&#39;s okay means that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.089" end="01:06:21.439" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.559" end="01:06:23.929" style="s2">that we look at history Lenin was a</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.439" end="01:06:25.429" style="s2">monster and if you want to know about</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.929" end="01:06:26.989" style="s2">that you can read souls and instance</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.429" end="01:06:29.059" style="s2">writings about Lenin because they</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.989" end="01:06:31.399" style="s2">Communist apologists say well it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.059" end="01:06:33.109" style="s2">Lenin Lenin was a good guy he was all</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.399" end="01:06:35.929" style="s2">motivated by love of the working class</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.109" end="01:06:39.229" style="s2">it&#39;s like well his henchman was Stalin</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.929" end="01:06:43.309" style="s2">and if your henchman is Stalin you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.229" end="01:06:46.099" style="s2">not a good guy and and Lenin was around</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.309" end="01:06:47.569" style="s2">during the early collectivization and if</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.099" end="01:06:49.549" style="s2">you read what he wrote you&#39;ll find out</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.569" end="01:06:51.199" style="s2">that he is perfectly willing to have any</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.549" end="01:06:53.569" style="s2">number of people die as long as his</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.199" end="01:06:56.329" style="s2">ideological system could be brought into</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.569" end="01:06:59.389" style="s2">being so there&#39;s no celebrating Lenin</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.329" end="01:07:01.939" style="s2">there&#39;s no work cool young Marxist hip</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.389" end="01:07:05.869" style="s2">revolutionaries and he&#39;s our Idol it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.939" end="01:07:06.799" style="s2">like there&#39;s none of that not if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.869" end="01:07:10.909" style="s2">know anything</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.799" end="01:07:12.439" style="s2">not if you&#39;re decent well there was</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.909" end="01:07:14.509" style="s2">death of the cool acts I told you about</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.439" end="01:07:16.339" style="s2">that there was Ukrainian famine that&#39;s 6</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.509" end="01:07:17.869" style="s2">million gone there there was the rise of</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.339" end="01:07:20.209" style="s2">the gulag state because it turned out</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.869" end="01:07:22.699" style="s2">that Russia the Soviet Union couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.209" end="01:07:26.479" style="s2">run on the principles that it had that</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.699" end="01:07:27.589" style="s2">it had laid down as sacrosanct they just</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.479" end="01:07:31.189" style="s2">didn&#39;t work so you had to enslave</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.589" end="01:07:36.409" style="s2">everybody and run your economy as a</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.189" end="01:07:38.389" style="s2">slave state essentially and try not to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.409" end="01:07:40.039" style="s2">kill the people in the gulags so fast</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.389" end="01:07:42.259" style="s2">that you can&#39;t suck some productive</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.039" end="01:07:44.239" style="s2">labor out of them was the death of tens</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.259" end="01:07:47.389" style="s2">of millions of people we don&#39;t even know</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.239" end="01:07:50.599" style="s2">the estimates range from 15 to 60</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.389" end="01:07:52.549" style="s2">million and like we won&#39;t give to</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.599" end="01:07:54.499" style="s2">Picayune about the numbers because after</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.549" end="01:07:57.469" style="s2">the first 10 million you kind of made</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.499" end="01:07:59.989" style="s2">your point and the fact that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.469" end="01:08:04.309" style="s2">know between 15 and 60 is actually an</p>

<p begin="01:08:04.309" end="01:08:10.030" style="s2">our count is off by tens of millions</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.340" end="01:08:13.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s only within the last century</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.030" end="01:08:16.280" style="s2">and then there was the 1956 crackdown on</p>

<p begin="01:08:16.280" end="01:08:20.900" style="s2">Czechoslovakia then there was the whole</p>

<p begin="01:08:53.980" end="01:08:59.120" style="s2">approximately I may have the date</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.210" end="01:09:00.650" style="s2">exactly wrong the Russians received an</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.020" end="01:09:21.710" style="s2">you know that was pretty close</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:23.089" style="s2">and so that was experiment number one</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.710" end="01:09:27.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say that that wasn&#39;t good that</p>

<p begin="01:10:08.810" end="01:10:14.030" style="s2">revered in China maybe that accounts for</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:16.790" style="s2">their affinity for North Korea which</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.030" end="01:10:20.030" style="s2">could still destroy us all the remnants</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.790" end="01:10:21.230" style="s2">of that horrible state maybe a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.030" end="01:10:23.870" style="s2">million people died in check</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.230" end="01:10:26.030" style="s2">during the Great Leap Forward that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.870" end="01:10:27.470" style="s2">hell of a leap forward well maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.030" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a hundred million you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.470" end="01:10:32.810" style="s2">it was only 40 million but as I said</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">before when you&#39;re counting in the tens</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.810" end="01:10:37.190" style="s2">of millions your points already made and</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:39.470" style="s2">then there was Cambodia and the killing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.190" end="01:10:41.090" style="s2">fields and Bulgaria East Germany and</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.470" end="01:10:43.130" style="s2">Romania and the Democratic People&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.980" end="01:10:55.820" style="s2">it was never a successful communist</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.350" end="01:11:00.890" style="s2">state Cuba I suppose came closest but it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.820" end="01:11:04.210" style="s2">was radically the Soviets poured money</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.890" end="01:11:04.210" style="s2">into Cuba so that doesn&#39;t really count</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.560" end="01:11:11.840" style="s2">so then the first question was well are</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.450" end="01:11:12.970" style="s2">these Marxists motivated by love or</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.840" end="01:11:18.410" style="s2">hatred</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.970" end="01:11:23.180" style="s2">well is it love or hatred that produces</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.410" end="01:11:25.970" style="s2">a hundred million dead people is that</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.180" end="01:11:27.650" style="s2">enough evidence or not and if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.970" end="01:11:29.870" style="s2">enough evidence if you think to yourself</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.650" end="01:11:33.980" style="s2">well that&#39;s not enough evidence it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.870" end="01:11:38.180" style="s2">never really given its proper a proper</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.980" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">try it&#39;s like well what would have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.180" end="01:11:42.380" style="s2">a proper try see I always think when I</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:45.739" style="s2">hear someone say that I know what you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.380" end="01:11:48.770" style="s2">think you think in your delusional</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.739" end="01:11:50.390" style="s2">arrogance that you understand the</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.770" end="01:11:52.820" style="s2">Marxist doctrines better than anyone</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.390" end="01:11:56.030" style="s2">else ever has and that if you were the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.820" end="01:11:58.280" style="s2">one implementing those doctrines you</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.030" end="01:12:04.940" style="s2">would have ushered in the utopia that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.280" end="01:12:06.920" style="s2">what you mean when you say that and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.940" end="01:12:08.360" style="s2">know there they say and there&#39;s an idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.920" end="01:12:10.480" style="s2">in the New Testament that there&#39;s a sin</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.360" end="01:12:12.890" style="s2">it&#39;s the sin against the holy ghost</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.480" end="01:12:14.980" style="s2">if you commit that sin no one really</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.890" end="01:12:17.540" style="s2">knows what it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.980" end="01:12:20.750" style="s2">that you can&#39;t be forgiven and I would</p>

<p begin="01:12:23.590" end="01:12:32.450" style="s2">the statement communism real communism</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.540" end="01:12:34.070" style="s2">was never tried with the underlying idea</p>

<p begin="01:12:46.229" end="01:12:53.760" style="s2">right so that&#39;s Marxism so let&#39;s go on</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.839" end="01:13:02.099" style="s2">to post-modernism we talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.760" end="01:13:04.439" style="s2">about it now hypothetically it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.099" end="01:13:06.300" style="s2">attitude of skepticism irony towards</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.439" end="01:13:10.139" style="s2">rejection of grand narratives ideologies</p>

<p begin="01:13:32.300" end="01:13:36.869" style="s2">there&#39;s other elements of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.619" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">one of them is that human nature is</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.869" end="01:13:42.749" style="s2">merely a social construct see the reason</p>

<p begin="01:13:42.749" end="01:13:46.169" style="s2">this is a postmodern critique as well</p>

<p begin="01:13:47.789" end="01:13:52.649" style="s2">why would you think that human nature is</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.010" end="01:13:53.909" style="s2">only a social construct well here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.649" end="01:13:56.909" style="s2">it&#39;s because that means you could</p>

<p begin="01:13:56.909" end="01:14:00.479" style="s2">was a very common idea among us among</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.949" end="01:14:03.419" style="s2">the communists you know they that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.479" end="01:14:05.129" style="s2">Moll wanted to wipe out Chinese history</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.419" end="01:14:07.369" style="s2">that&#39;s why the Red Guard went around in</p>

<p begin="01:14:47.850" end="01:14:52.540" style="s2">they came about</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.750" end="01:14:54.640" style="s2">pretty much when marxism was no longer</p>

<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:55.480" style="s2">emptied out the cities and put all the</p>

<p begin="01:16:09.940" end="01:16:15.150" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly how complicit the Western</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.670" end="01:16:17.290" style="s2">leftist intellectuals were in</p>

<p begin="01:16:21.430" end="01:16:27.610" style="s2">we just gone underground and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.000" end="01:16:32.580" style="s2">I see that&#39;s what I see when I see</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.610" end="01:16:32.580" style="s2">post-modernism so what happened was</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.750" end="01:16:42.820" style="s2">despite the affinity of Western</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.890" end="01:16:44.500" style="s2">intellectuals for Marxism maybe because</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.820" end="01:16:46.720" style="s2">they weren&#39;t paid as much as bankers</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.500" end="01:16:48.550" style="s2">let&#39;s say if we&#39;re being cynical about</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.720" end="01:16:50.260" style="s2">it because I&#39;ve often thought that if</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.550" end="01:16:52.390" style="s2">you paid sociologists as much as</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.260" end="01:16:54.910" style="s2">investment bankers they&#39;d be capitalists</p>

<p begin="01:17:01.880" end="01:17:05.510" style="s2">because one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.350" end="01:17:07.340" style="s2">happening is that as the universities</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.510" end="01:17:09.410" style="s2">have become corporatized and corrupted</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.340" end="01:17:11.330" style="s2">in a variety of ways more and more of</p>

<p begin="01:17:11.330" end="01:17:15.110" style="s2">think it&#39;s up to 30 40 50 percent</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.460" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">something like that now they&#39;ve got no</p>

<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:36.920" style="s2">anyways by the end of the 60s so much</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.840" end="01:17:39.920" style="s2">data on the catastrophic failures of</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.920" end="01:17:42.770" style="s2">communism had accrued that even the most</p>

<p begin="01:17:42.770" end="01:17:51.370" style="s2">to admit that the jig was up but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.570" end="01:17:54.800" style="s2">a problem because that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.370" end="01:17:55.580" style="s2">ideology right that&#39;s the whole raison</p>

<p begin="01:17:55.580" end="01:17:59.890" style="s2">he says in this terrible alberta French</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.130" end="01:18:06.650" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna just give that up what are</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.239" end="01:18:09.260" style="s2">you gonna do after that well what</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.650" end="01:18:12.110" style="s2">happened was post-modernism was invented</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.260" end="01:18:14.570" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a sleight of hand as far as</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.110" end="01:18:17.230" style="s2">I can tell so and and with</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.570" end="01:18:21.739" style="s2">post-modernism identity politics and so</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.230" end="01:18:23.690" style="s2">the postmodern transformation is well</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.739" end="01:18:27.440" style="s2">we&#39;re a little wrong with the working</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.690" end="01:18:29.570" style="s2">class thing turns out that communists</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.440" end="01:18:31.250" style="s2">killed them all and capitalists make</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.570" end="01:18:32.480" style="s2">them all rich and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.250" end="01:18:35.900" style="s2">exactly the opposite of what we</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.480" end="01:18:38.890" style="s2">predicted but maybe there&#39;s still a way</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.900" end="01:18:42.860" style="s2">this could be salvaged how about if we</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.890" end="01:18:48.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t say working-class capitalists</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.860" end="01:18:48.160" style="s2">we say oppressor oppressed well just</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.910" end="01:18:53.570" style="s2">we&#39;ll just trance transform the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.440" end="01:18:54.680" style="s2">terminology a bit and we&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.570" end="01:18:57.230" style="s2">thinking about all the other ways that</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.680" end="01:18:58.250" style="s2">people are oppressed and then and all</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.230" end="01:18:59.989" style="s2">the other ways that people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.250" end="01:19:04.340" style="s2">oppressors and then we can play the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.989" end="01:19:06.410" style="s2">damn game under a new guise and now look</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.340" end="01:19:07.969" style="s2">the post modernists were Marxist so</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.410" end="01:19:09.920" style="s2">let&#39;s make no mistake</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.969" end="01:19:11.810" style="s2">Derrida himself said that post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.920" end="01:19:12.739" style="s2">was a transformation of Marxism I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.810" end="01:19:15.530" style="s2">making this up</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.739" end="01:19:17.389" style="s2">the question is why well because you</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.530" end="01:19:19.130" style="s2">could say well post-modernism is a valid</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.389" end="01:19:20.570" style="s2">philosophical school and we&#39;ll get into</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.130" end="01:19:22.010" style="s2">that for a minute and they make some</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.570" end="01:19:23.989" style="s2">valid claims one of them for example</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.010" end="01:19:25.580" style="s2">this is a central post modernist claim</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.989" end="01:19:27.590" style="s2">is that there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.580" end="01:19:29.150" style="s2">ways of interpreting the world and that</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.590" end="01:19:30.920" style="s2">actually turns out to be technically</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.150" end="01:19:33.320" style="s2">correct part of the reason that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.920" end="01:19:36.170" style="s2">had a very difficult time building</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.320" end="01:19:37.880" style="s2">robots AI robots that can operate in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.170" end="01:19:40.340" style="s2">real world is because perceiving the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.880" end="01:19:41.750" style="s2">real world turns out to be so difficult</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.340" end="01:19:44.170" style="s2">that we really can&#39;t figure out how</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.750" end="01:19:46.489" style="s2">human beings do it because it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.170" end="01:19:48.139" style="s2">susceptible to an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.489" end="01:19:49.730" style="s2">interpretations so that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.139" end="01:19:51.710" style="s2">correct now I&#39;m not going to give the</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.730" end="01:19:53.420" style="s2">post modernists a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.710" end="01:19:55.040" style="s2">credit for discovering that because it</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.420" end="01:19:57.139" style="s2">was discovered simultaneously in about</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.040" end="01:20:03.100" style="s2">five disciplines at pretty much the same</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.139" end="01:20:03.100" style="s2">time but you give the devil his due so</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.199" end="01:20:08.719" style="s2">so what&#39;s the logic it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.639" end="01:20:12.889" style="s2">well there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.719" end="01:20:14.449" style="s2">interpretations of the world you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.889" end="01:20:18.770" style="s2">tell which of those are canonically</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.449" end="01:20:20.449" style="s2">correct correct the basic narrative of</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.770" end="01:20:23.600" style="s2">human struggle is oppressor versus</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.449" end="01:20:25.580" style="s2">oppressed we use category structures to</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.600" end="01:20:28.250" style="s2">constrain that infinite number of</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.580" end="01:20:29.960" style="s2">interpretations because the basic</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.250" end="01:20:32.119" style="s2">narrative is oppressor versus oppressed</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.960" end="01:20:39.460" style="s2">we choose those narratives that serve</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.119" end="01:20:44.929" style="s2">our function as oppressors so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.460" end="01:20:47.389" style="s2">deeply cynical but credible you know and</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.929" end="01:20:52.100" style="s2">you can say if you&#39;re not naive that</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.389" end="01:20:54.560" style="s2">people are motivated by power and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.100" end="01:20:56.810" style="s2">our interpretations of the world can be</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.560" end="01:20:58.699" style="s2">self-serving I mean we do want to serve</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.810" end="01:21:02.420" style="s2">ourselves after all because otherwise we</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.699" end="01:21:04.460" style="s2">die and so and we are centered in one</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.420" end="01:21:08.840" style="s2">place and so we can&#39;t see everything and</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.460" end="01:21:10.670" style="s2">we&#39;re biased so so there is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.840" end="01:21:12.920" style="s2">probability that the way that we look in</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.670" end="01:21:15.710" style="s2">the world at the world will be tainted</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.920" end="01:21:18.650" style="s2">by narrow self-interest and maybe even</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.710" end="01:21:20.780" style="s2">tainted by in-group interests beyond</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.650" end="01:21:21.170" style="s2">narrow individual self-interest and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.780" end="01:21:23.360" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.170" end="01:21:25.790" style="s2">is true but it&#39;s also not all bad you</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.360" end="01:21:28.100" style="s2">know like we a good person takes care of</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.790" end="01:21:30.080" style="s2">his or her family what does that mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.100" end="01:21:31.760" style="s2">what means you prefer your family to</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.080" end="01:21:34.940" style="s2">outsiders you we&#39;re gonna get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.760" end="01:21:37.460" style="s2">that it&#39;s a form of prejudice like it</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.940" end="01:21:39.980" style="s2">really is like your choice of sexual</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.460" end="01:21:42.350" style="s2">partner is a form of prejudice right</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.980" end="01:21:48.739" style="s2">I mean maybe it should be distributed in</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.350" end="01:21:51.010" style="s2">an egalitarian manner hey that would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.739" end="01:21:54.739" style="s2">a lot funnier if it isn&#39;t a possibility</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.010" end="01:21:58.160" style="s2">like in in in in in Huxley&#39;s brave new</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.739" end="01:22:00.110" style="s2">world that was the rule you you shared</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.160" end="01:22:02.390" style="s2">yourself with whoever asked because it</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.110" end="01:22:05.480" style="s2">was rude not to and you know what it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.390" end="01:22:07.219" style="s2">actually rude not to it&#39;s seriously rude</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.480" end="01:22:08.860" style="s2">now is that something you want to take</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.219" end="01:22:12.310" style="s2">away from people you want that to be</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.860" end="01:22:14.870" style="s2">distributed in an egalitarian fashion</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.310" end="01:22:17.510" style="s2">how prejudiced are you when you choose</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.870" end="01:22:20.150" style="s2">someone to sleep with you choose that</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.510" end="01:22:22.340" style="s2">person and not everyone else it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.150" end="01:22:24.830" style="s2">ultimate in prejudice if you say well</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.340" end="01:22:26.030" style="s2">that&#39;s not prejudicial oh yes it is you</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.830" end="01:22:28.880" style="s2">usually go for the most attractive</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.030" end="01:22:30.800" style="s2">partner you can find usually going for</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.880" end="01:22:32.390" style="s2">the healthiest partner you go for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.800" end="01:22:36.500" style="s2">best person you can find who can</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.390" end="01:22:42.140" style="s2">tolerate you it&#39;s prejudicial in every</p>

<p begin="01:27:03.960" end="01:27:08.010" style="s2">very rapidly ok so what are the</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.730" end="01:27:09.600" style="s2">constraints ok first of all you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.010" end="01:27:11.940" style="s2">have an interpretation that leads to</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.600" end="01:27:14.400" style="s2">immediately to your death or you&#39;re dead</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.940" end="01:27:16.770" style="s2">now if you want to be dead that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:18.990" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t want to be then you got</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.770" end="01:27:21.450" style="s2">a lot of limited options right you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.990" end="01:27:23.490" style="s2">get to run naked across an eight-lane</p>

<p begin="01:27:23.490" end="01:27:28.680" style="s2">probably you&#39;ll be dead that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.130" end="01:27:30.210" style="s2">interpretation ok so you might say</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.680" end="01:27:33.780" style="s2">because you&#39;re fragile and vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.210" end="01:27:35.640" style="s2">and mortal that there&#39;s a limited number</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.780" end="01:27:38.430" style="s2">of ways that you can look at the world</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.640" end="01:27:41.400" style="s2">that don&#39;t result in let&#39;s say death or</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.430" end="01:27:41.760" style="s2">serious damage or agony that&#39;s a bad</p>

<p begin="01:27:41.760" end="01:27:46.230" style="s2">agony is a bad thing most people agree</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.800" end="01:27:48.840" style="s2">on that so you&#39;re constrained by pain</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.230" end="01:27:50.700" style="s2">and anxiety at least your</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.840" end="01:27:53.220" style="s2">interpretations are constrained by pain</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.700" end="01:27:54.900" style="s2">and anxiety and you know you can make</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.220" end="01:27:57.510" style="s2">pain worse or better by thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.900" end="01:28:00.330" style="s2">it to some degree but only to some</p>

<p begin="01:28:00.330" end="01:28:07.050" style="s2">pain is your master okay so that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.680" end="01:28:09.450" style="s2">constraint that&#39;s a big big constraint</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.050" end="01:28:13.440" style="s2">well but the constraints are worse than</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.450" end="01:28:14.970" style="s2">that because not only do you not get to</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.440" end="01:28:16.970" style="s2">have an interpretation of the world that</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.970" end="01:28:18.900" style="s2">produces anxiety and suffering right now</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.970" end="01:28:21.030" style="s2">but you don&#39;t get to have an</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.900" end="01:28:23.400" style="s2">interpretation of the world that if you</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.030" end="01:28:26.220" style="s2">iterated across time produces pain and</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.400" end="01:28:27.810" style="s2">suffering and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a big</p>

<p begin="01:31:04.020" end="01:31:08.460" style="s2">game you get everybody to say well</p>

<p begin="01:31:10.200" end="01:31:14.370" style="s2">then you say well which task would you</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.060" end="01:31:15.930" style="s2">do you have to do some how about you and</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.370" end="01:31:18.930" style="s2">you know which task would you do and</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.930" end="01:31:20.220" style="s2">everybody agrees and then you say well</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.930" end="01:31:21.750" style="s2">unless you can come up with a better</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.220" end="01:31:23.640" style="s2">solution that&#39;s the one we&#39;re gonna go</p>

<p begin="01:31:29.490" end="01:31:33.450" style="s2">else and maybe that&#39;s the best solution</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.530" end="01:31:35.370" style="s2">you could come up with and that was PJ&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:32:06.660" end="01:32:12.060" style="s2">that if you set the state up properly it</p>

<p begin="01:32:38.340" end="01:32:41.330" style="s2">reason we have archetypal</p>

<p begin="01:32:41.330" end="01:32:45.600" style="s2">so and we also have archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.739" end="01:32:48.719" style="s2">representations of the relationship of</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.600" end="01:32:51.180" style="s2">the individual to the social structure</p>

<p begin="01:32:52.980" end="01:32:59.580" style="s2">to embody the social structure but also</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.219" end="01:33:02.010" style="s2">just serve as its eyes and its mouth so</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.580" end="01:33:04.980" style="s2">that can update itself when necessary</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.010" end="01:33:07.500" style="s2">so you take on the mantle of your father</p>
<p begin="01:33:04.980" end="01:33:10.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say but he&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.500" end="01:33:12.989" style="s2">he&#39;s the past he can&#39;t see you can see</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.650" end="01:33:14.489" style="s2">so you take the structure that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.989" end="01:33:17.160" style="s2">there and you modify it where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.489" end="01:33:19.440" style="s2">necessary and that modification process</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.160" end="01:33:21.510" style="s2">is necessary or the state becomes too</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.440" end="01:33:23.190" style="s2">static and collapses and that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.510" end="01:33:24.989" style="s2">state has to be subordinate to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.190" end="01:33:28.290" style="s2">individual and that&#39;s what Western</p>

<p begin="01:33:28.290" end="01:33:33.420" style="s2">let them go that&#39;s the idea the logos</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.390" end="01:33:35.010" style="s2">that&#39;s a big idea and you&#39;d want to live</p>

<p begin="01:36:23.179" end="01:36:28.610" style="s2">wasn&#39;t wrong and no one was happy about</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.059" end="01:36:29.300" style="s2">it and no one&#39;s happy about it now you</p>

<p begin="01:36:29.300" end="01:36:32.930" style="s2">when you&#39;ve discovered something in a</p>

<p begin="01:36:38.830" end="01:36:45.920" style="s2">but if you take let&#39;s say there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.540" end="01:36:48.340" style="s2">difference between men and women in</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.920" end="01:36:50.450" style="s2">terms of trait agreeableness</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.340" end="01:36:52.430" style="s2">compassion and politeness on average</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.450" end="01:36:54.950" style="s2">women are more agreeable than men and</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.430" end="01:36:57.080" style="s2">the difference is approximately this if</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.950" end="01:36:58.610" style="s2">you take random pairs of men and women</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.080" end="01:37:00.830" style="s2">out of the population let&#39;s say you had</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.610" end="01:37:02.390" style="s2">to make a bet on who was more agreeable</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.830" end="01:37:05.660" style="s2">if you bet that it was the woman you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.390" end="01:37:08.570" style="s2">be right 60% of the time well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.660" end="01:37:10.850" style="s2">that much means you&#39;d be wrong 40% of</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.570" end="01:37:13.280" style="s2">the time that&#39;s almost 50% of the time</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.850" end="01:37:15.920" style="s2">so this is a big difference by social</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.280" end="01:37:17.330" style="s2">science standards but that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.920" end="01:37:18.860" style="s2">magnitude of the difference there are</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.330" end="01:37:20.600" style="s2">some differences that are bigger like</p>
<p begin="01:37:18.860" end="01:37:22.220" style="s2">the difference between men and women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.600" end="01:37:23.510" style="s2">interest in people versus things is</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.220" end="01:37:25.430" style="s2">actually bigger than that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.510" end="01:37:27.170" style="s2">biggest difference we know but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.430" end="01:37:30.890" style="s2">big difference let&#39;s say the agreeable</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.170" end="01:37:34.220" style="s2">this difference but still they the</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.890" end="01:37:36.200" style="s2">shared attributes of men and women far</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.220" end="01:37:38.960" style="s2">outweigh the attributes that</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.200" end="01:37:41.300" style="s2">differentiate them because you could ask</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.960" end="01:37:43.670" style="s2">are there more differences within groups</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.300" end="01:37:47.150" style="s2">or between them now the postmodern</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.670" end="01:37:49.610" style="s2">answer to that is between them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.150" end="01:37:50.960" style="s2">why you need diversity by group right</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.610" end="01:37:51.980" style="s2">that&#39;s why you need different races</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.960" end="01:37:54.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why you need different</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.980" end="01:37:58.310" style="s2">ethnicities and sexual preferences and</p>
<p begin="01:37:54.110" end="01:37:59.990" style="s2">all of that well that&#39;s wrong there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.310" end="01:38:01.690" style="s2">moral difference within the groups than</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.990" end="01:38:04.220" style="s2">there is between them you don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.690" end="01:38:06.470" style="s2">diversity by crossing the groups you get</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.220" end="01:38:09.020" style="s2">diversity by by selecting across</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.470" end="01:38:11.120" style="s2">individuals in fact the idea that there</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.020" end="01:38:13.040" style="s2">is more differences between groups that</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.120" end="01:38:15.950" style="s2">there is between individuals is actually</p>

<p begin="01:38:15.950" end="01:38:22.490" style="s2">fundamental racist idea which is well</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.320" end="01:38:25.280" style="s2">let&#39;s say you&#39;re Asian Oriental to use</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.490" end="01:38:28.370" style="s2">the old word to discriminate the one</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.280" end="01:38:30.380" style="s2">type of Asian say from the other you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.370" end="01:38:33.050" style="s2">so different from me that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.380" end="01:38:34.490" style="s2">overlap between our groups and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.050" end="01:38:37.400" style="s2">also so different and there&#39;s so little</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.490" end="01:38:39.260" style="s2">difference within your group that now</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.400" end="01:38:40.700" style="s2">that I know that you&#39;re not me you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:38:42.920" end="01:38:50.320" style="s2">no technically that&#39;s incorrect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.890" end="01:38:50.320" style="s2">wrong that isn&#39;t how you get diversity</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.030" end="01:38:56.360" style="s2">now diversity is actually necessary</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.650" end="01:38:57.530" style="s2">because people differ in intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.360" end="01:38:58.850" style="s2">and they different temperament they</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.530" end="01:39:00.830" style="s2">different skills and so you actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.850" end="01:39:02.210" style="s2">need diversity because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.830" end="01:39:06.350" style="s2">can&#39;t take advantage of all those</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.210" end="01:39:10.040" style="s2">differences so you need diversity but</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.350" end="01:39:11.780" style="s2">you need genuine diversity and like what</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.040" end="01:39:13.250" style="s2">would genuine diversity mean if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.780" end="01:39:14.960" style="s2">trying to put together a work team you</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.250" end="01:39:16.820" style="s2">want enough you want people of</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.960" end="01:39:21.260" style="s2">sufficient diversity so that they more</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.820" end="01:39:23.000" style="s2">or less so that you gather together the</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.260" end="01:39:24.650" style="s2">appropriate talents to produce the</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.000" end="01:39:25.730" style="s2">implement that&#39;s necessary to work</p>

<p begin="01:39:29.449" end="01:39:35.500" style="s2">and so the proper diversity with regards</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.780" end="01:39:38.270" style="s2">to employment is the diversity that</p>

<p begin="01:43:47.290" end="01:43:52.270" style="s2">the system is like 30 percent warped</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.080" end="01:43:53.710" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s not much more</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.270" end="01:43:56.469" style="s2">than that because we can account for</p>

<p begin="01:44:05.440" end="01:44:10.090" style="s2">so there&#39;s error some of its health</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.410" end="01:44:11.469" style="s2">right because sometimes you&#39;ve got what</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.090" end="01:44:13.750" style="s2">you need but you get cut off at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:11.469" end="01:44:15.670" style="s2">knees or your family members do or you</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.750" end="01:44:18.219" style="s2">know some tragic thing befalls you with</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.670" end="01:44:19.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a randomness in this system that</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.219" end="01:44:21.510" style="s2">accounts for a fair bit of it and then</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.690" end="01:44:24.180" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain amount of corruption</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.510" end="01:44:28.500" style="s2">fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.180" end="01:44:37.870" style="s2">but not so much that the lights go off</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.500" end="01:44:44.199" style="s2">okay what time is it 8:15 and I started</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.870" end="01:44:47.400" style="s2">win sorry it&#39;s me 6:30</p>

<p begin="01:44:59.360" end="01:45:04.590" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna go for five more minutes and</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.670" end="01:45:07.890" style="s2">then I&#39;ll wrap this up I want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.590" end="01:45:17.460" style="s2">about intersectionality and and white</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.890" end="01:45:19.860" style="s2">privilege a bit so so I first said well</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.460" end="01:45:23.570" style="s2">we analyze Marxism we have analyzed</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.860" end="01:45:25.860" style="s2">post-modernism I suggested that</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.570" end="01:45:27.740" style="s2">post-modernism was a way for the Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.860" end="01:45:30.240" style="s2">to keep going under a new guys I</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.740" end="01:45:32.580" style="s2">suggested that Marxism was fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.240" end="01:45:35.760" style="s2">based on hatred rather than sympathy and</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.580" end="01:45:39.390" style="s2">an empathy I suggested that the corpses</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.760" end="01:45:40.770" style="s2">were the evidence for that I told you</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.390" end="01:45:46.260" style="s2">why I think post-modernism is</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.770" end="01:45:47.400" style="s2">fundamentally wrong but now I want to</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.260" end="01:45:53.640" style="s2">talk to you a little bit about white</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.400" end="01:45:55.050" style="s2">privilege so the first thing that I can</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.640" end="01:45:57.840" style="s2">I haven&#39;t got this quite figured out</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.050" end="01:45:59.730" style="s2">yeah I can&#39;t quite figure out why the</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.840" end="01:46:03.300" style="s2">post modernists have made the canonical</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.730" end="01:46:07.800" style="s2">distinctions they&#39;ve made race ethnicity</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.300" end="01:46:10.560" style="s2">sexual proclivity sexual gender identity</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.800" end="01:46:12.510" style="s2">let&#39;s say those are four dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.560" end="01:46:14.460" style="s2">along which people vary but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.510" end="01:46:17.520" style="s2">very large number of dimensions along</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.460" end="01:46:19.620" style="s2">which people vary right in fact given</p>
<p begin="01:46:17.520" end="01:46:21.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s an infinite number of ways</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.620" end="01:46:22.980" style="s2">of interpreting the world you could</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.600" end="01:46:24.570" style="s2">immediately point out that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.980" end="01:46:26.790" style="s2">infinite number of dimensions along</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.570" end="01:46:28.170" style="s2">which people vary and so then the</p>
<p begin="01:46:26.790" end="01:46:30.000" style="s2">postmodern question is why would you</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.170" end="01:46:31.800" style="s2">privilege some of those dimensions over</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.000" end="01:46:33.630" style="s2">the other and I would say well because</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.800" end="01:46:35.220" style="s2">it sustains your bloody Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.630" end="01:46:37.230" style="s2">interpretation that&#39;s why but you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.220" end="01:46:37.920" style="s2">gonna say that because it marginalizes</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.230" end="01:46:39.450" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.920" end="01:46:41.640" style="s2">you&#39;ve marginalized that so you can</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.450" end="01:46:44.010" style="s2">ignore it so that&#39;s one of the fun</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.640" end="01:46:47.970" style="s2">things about post-modernism you can you</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.010" end="01:46:53.430" style="s2">can I have a very vulgar image in my</p>
<p begin="01:46:47.970" end="01:46:56.490" style="s2">mind but I won&#39;t share that with you but</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.430" end="01:46:58.080" style="s2">you can infer it here&#39;s some ways people</p>

<p begin="01:50:45.199" end="01:50:48.560" style="s2">asking them is by doing something called</p>

<p begin="01:50:57.350" end="01:51:01.429" style="s2">asking because you might think it&#39;s 60</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.300" end="01:51:04.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s probably not it&#39;s probably five</p>

<p begin="01:51:04.040" end="01:51:08.600" style="s2">who cares about that there&#39;s no such</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.440" end="01:51:10.580" style="s2">thing as methodology anyways that&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="01:51:10.580" end="01:51:15.409" style="s2">European patriarchy so we can just not</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.400" end="01:51:17.300" style="s2">bother with that and we can pen a few</p>

<p begin="01:51:17.300" end="01:51:22.130" style="s2">constructed and then we can screw up the</p>

<p begin="01:51:22.130" end="01:51:27.139" style="s2">later okay so here&#39;s your white</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.250" end="01:51:29.840" style="s2">privilege list some of it there&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:52:06.219" end="01:52:12.010" style="s2">think something like that okay is that</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.239" end="01:52:14.950" style="s2">white privilege is that like majority</p>

<p begin="01:52:23.800" end="01:52:29.530" style="s2">within your culture so let&#39;s say you</p>

<p begin="01:52:31.030" end="01:52:36.130" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s what the culture is for</p>

<p begin="01:52:36.130" end="01:52:39.370" style="s2">bother building the damn thing if it</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.810" end="01:52:41.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t accrue benefits to you now you</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.370" end="01:52:43.540" style="s2">might say well one of the consequences</p>
<p begin="01:52:41.080" end="01:52:46.150" style="s2">that it accrues fewer benefits to those</p>
<p begin="01:52:43.540" end="01:52:47.560" style="s2">who aren&#39;t in the culture yeah but you</p>

<p begin="01:53:57.490" end="01:54:00.100" style="s2">regard logical coherence here it comes</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.740" end="01:54:03.280" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.100" end="01:54:05.440" style="s2">as a creation of the white European male</p>

<p begin="01:54:07.540" end="01:54:11.830" style="s2">technically the case so logical in</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.120" end="01:54:13.870" style="s2">coherence it doesn&#39;t matter and you</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.830" end="01:54:15.760" style="s2">could say well if you act out your</p>
<p begin="01:54:13.870" end="01:54:17.800" style="s2">logically incoherent ideas in the world</p>
<p begin="01:54:15.760" end="01:54:20.080" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna run face first into a brick</p>
<p begin="01:54:17.800" end="01:54:22.720" style="s2">wall and the postmodern answer to that</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.080" end="01:54:25.570" style="s2">is there&#39;s actually no real world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.720" end="01:54:28.150" style="s2">all interpretation so there&#39;s no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:25.570" end="01:54:30.010" style="s2">no having that discussion but the post</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.150" end="01:54:31.540" style="s2">modernists don&#39;t care because they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:54:32.950" end="01:54:39.070" style="s2">anyways so here we are well so I made a</p>
<p begin="01:54:36.970" end="01:54:44.920" style="s2">case tonight you know I&#39;ll go over</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.070" end="01:54:48.540" style="s2">what&#39;s the case the post modernists are</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.920" end="01:54:50.890" style="s2">wrong they&#39;re philosophically naive</p>
<p begin="01:54:48.540" end="01:54:52.750" style="s2">they&#39;re right about an infinite number</p>
<p begin="01:54:50.890" end="01:54:55.030" style="s2">of interpretations and wrong about a</p>

<p begin="01:54:55.030" end="01:54:59.860" style="s2">and that&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s death</p>
<p begin="01:54:57.850" end="01:55:01.480" style="s2">that&#39;s the end of post modernist theory</p>

<p begin="01:55:15.310" end="01:55:19.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean wrong and you you can think</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.220" end="01:55:21.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s lots of would-be</p>

<p begin="01:55:27.280" end="01:55:31.750" style="s2">tyranny so you can you you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.130" end="01:55:33.460" style="s2">think that murder and genocide is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:55:31.750" end="01:55:35.020" style="s2">especially if the right people are</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.460" end="01:55:37.270" style="s2">murdered and genocided right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:35.020" end="01:55:39.220" style="s2">actually part of that part of the whole</p>

<p begin="01:55:58.900" end="01:56:02.320" style="s2">get away with that because it&#39;s too</p>

<p begin="01:58:24.659" end="01:58:28.379" style="s2">your lectures use the term</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.429" end="01:58:31.019" style="s2">post-modernism interchangeably with</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.379" end="01:58:32.969" style="s2">cultural Marxism nihilism and moral</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.019" end="01:58:34.769" style="s2">relativism I wonder if you&#39;ve considered</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.969" end="01:58:36.689" style="s2">or heard alternative beliefs that the</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.769" end="01:58:38.579" style="s2">term post-modernism is not necessary is</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.689" end="01:58:40.559" style="s2">necessarily always congruent on a</p>

<p begin="01:58:49.889" end="01:58:54.059" style="s2">pseudo modernism whereas some would call</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.229" end="01:58:55.619" style="s2">what you endorsed to not be modernism</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.059" end="01:58:59.459" style="s2">but in fact meta modernism</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.619" end="01:59:00.959" style="s2">postmillennialism or post post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.459" end="01:59:05.280" style="s2">which unfortunately has a terrible name</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.959" end="01:59:08.599" style="s2">and then I have very brief definitions</p>
<p begin="01:59:05.280" end="01:59:12.059" style="s2">of those words if you need me to well no</p>
<p begin="01:59:08.599" end="01:59:15.419" style="s2">as I said tonight you have to give the</p>
<p begin="01:59:12.059" end="01:59:17.579" style="s2">devil his due and so we&#39;ll do that so</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.419" end="01:59:20.039" style="s2">yes there is a very large number of ways</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.579" end="01:59:24.800" style="s2">of interpreting the world there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.039" end="01:59:28.829" style="s2">doubt about that yes people use biased</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.800" end="01:59:32.419" style="s2">interpretive lenses too as means of</p>
<p begin="01:59:28.829" end="01:59:32.419" style="s2">interpreting the world to put their own</p>
<p begin="01:59:32.570" end="01:59:38.010" style="s2">priorities forward without necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.789" end="01:59:42.169" style="s2">knowing that they&#39;re doing so and that</p>
<p begin="01:59:38.010" end="01:59:43.949" style="s2">that can corrupt them and society the</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.169" end="01:59:45.419" style="s2">psychoanalysts figured that out way</p>
<p begin="01:59:43.949" end="01:59:46.320" style="s2">before the post modernist so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.419" end="01:59:52.439" style="s2">get any credit for that</p>
<p begin="01:59:46.320" end="01:59:55.379" style="s2">like really none so it&#39;s useful to keep</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.439" end="01:59:57.360" style="s2">those things in mind it&#39;s when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.379" end="02:00:00.419" style="s2">put but it&#39;s when they&#39;re put for it is</p>
<p begin="01:59:57.360" end="02:00:02.760" style="s2">absolute truth that disturbs me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:00.419" end="02:00:04.530" style="s2">like yes people are probably racist they</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.760" end="02:00:06.239" style="s2">might even be implicitly racist although</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.530" end="02:00:07.349" style="s2">we don&#39;t know what that means and we</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.239" end="02:00:09.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know how it&#39;s related to their</p>
<p begin="02:00:07.349" end="02:00:11.539" style="s2">explicit behavior and we can&#39;t separate</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.570" end="02:00:14.489" style="s2">it from in-group preference or</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.539" end="02:00:15.959" style="s2">necessarily from reaction to novelty so</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.489" end="02:00:18.709" style="s2">it&#39;s a tricky business you know</p>
<p begin="02:00:15.959" end="02:00:23.269" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know how to separate</p>
<p begin="02:00:18.709" end="02:00:25.649" style="s2">stereotypical racial perceptions from</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.269" end="02:00:26.789" style="s2">perceptual heuristics we don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.649" end="02:00:28.169" style="s2">to do that because you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.789" end="02:00:29.669" style="s2">oversimplifying the world because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.169" end="02:00:32.999" style="s2">not smart enough to live in the world as</p>
<p begin="02:00:29.669" end="02:00:33.690" style="s2">it is you have to oversimplify it so yes</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.999" end="02:00:35.640" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="02:00:33.690" end="02:00:37.680" style="s2">times when post-modernism is useful i</p>
<p begin="02:00:35.640" end="02:00:40.739" style="s2">used it quite useful ii tonight to</p>
<p begin="02:00:37.680" end="02:00:44.130" style="s2">deconstruct post-modernism in fact so</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.739" end="02:00:45.690" style="s2">but but weights when it&#39;s turned into an</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.130" end="02:00:48.210" style="s2">absolute especially a moral absolute</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.690" end="02:00:50.520" style="s2">that it and when it&#39;ll eyes itself with</p>
<p begin="02:00:48.210" end="02:00:51.810" style="s2">Marxism it&#39;s like sorry guys know you</p>
<p begin="02:00:50.520" end="02:00:53.520" style="s2">don&#39;t like grand narratives you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.810" end="02:00:56.280" style="s2">get to go there well that&#39;s where you</p>

<p begin="02:01:04.949" end="02:01:09.030" style="s2">have to say about that</p>
<p begin="02:01:05.850" end="02:01:12.120" style="s2">thanks hello dr. peterson thank you very</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.030" end="02:01:14.100" style="s2">much and my question is regarding ADHD</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.120" end="02:01:15.690" style="s2">which is something i haven&#39;t heard you</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.100" end="02:01:19.770" style="s2">speak a whole lot about maybe a little</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.690" end="02:01:21.690" style="s2">bit now it seems to me that we or at</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.770" end="02:01:24.780" style="s2">least maybe just me do not quite</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.690" end="02:01:27.750" style="s2">understand ADHD too what could be its</p>
<p begin="02:01:24.780" end="02:01:30.180" style="s2">full capacity maybe and because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:27.750" end="02:01:33.210" style="s2">many many voices saying that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.180" end="02:01:35.280" style="s2">over diagnosed overblown small mental</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.210" end="02:01:37.020" style="s2">variance that&#39;s prevalent in boys or</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.280" end="02:01:39.719" style="s2">it&#39;s just young boys being young boys</p>
<p begin="02:01:37.020" end="02:01:42.930" style="s2">and then there are some that would fight</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.719" end="02:01:46.199" style="s2">and advocate for very different</p>
<p begin="02:01:42.930" end="02:01:47.730" style="s2">treatment in the academic world and I</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.199" end="02:01:53.790" style="s2">was wondering what you what your</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.730" end="02:01:55.560" style="s2">thoughts are on ADHD itself and on the</p>
<p begin="02:01:53.790" end="02:01:58.590" style="s2">whether you think it&#39;s over diagnosed</p>
<p begin="02:01:55.560" end="02:02:01.230" style="s2">and maybe advice for me as someone who</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.590" end="02:02:03.750" style="s2">has been diagnosed with ADHD on how to</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.230" end="02:02:06.300" style="s2">overcome it without maybe becoming</p>
<p begin="02:02:03.750" end="02:02:10.890" style="s2">completely reliant on prescribed</p>
<p begin="02:02:06.300" end="02:02:16.350" style="s2">medication okay so first of all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.890" end="02:02:20.010" style="s2">definitely over diagnosed second it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.350" end="02:02:22.710" style="s2">it&#39;s a very unreliable psychiatric</p>
<p begin="02:02:20.010" end="02:02:24.300" style="s2">diagnosis many psychiatric diagnoses are</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.710" end="02:02:26.580" style="s2">unreliable and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.300" end="02:02:28.199" style="s2">psychiatric diagnosis aren&#39;t precisely</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.580" end="02:02:30.270" style="s2">scientific categories they&#39;re weird</p>
<p begin="02:02:28.199" end="02:02:32.030" style="s2">hybrids right first of all psychiatrists</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.270" end="02:02:33.989" style="s2">aren&#39;t scientists they&#39;re engineers</p>
<p begin="02:02:32.030" end="02:02:35.880" style="s2">engineers are trying to do something</p>
<p begin="02:02:33.989" end="02:02:37.380" style="s2">rather than to describe the objective</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.880" end="02:02:39.510" style="s2">world and psychiatrists are trying to</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.380" end="02:02:41.850" style="s2">make people healthy whatever that means</p>
<p begin="02:02:39.510" end="02:02:44.330" style="s2">it&#39;s actually partly ethical it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.850" end="02:02:44.330" style="s2">complicated</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.700" end="02:02:52.230" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how to distinguish it from</p>
<p begin="02:02:49.380" end="02:02:53.550" style="s2">temperamental variation so for example</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.230" end="02:02:54.990" style="s2">if you&#39;re high in openness and high in</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.550" end="02:02:58.950" style="s2">extraversion and low in</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.990" end="02:03:01.650" style="s2">conscientiousness low and agreeableness</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.950" end="02:03:03.690" style="s2">conscientiousness and and high in</p>
<p begin="02:03:01.650" end="02:03:07.110" style="s2">neuroticism you&#39;re likely to manifest</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.690" end="02:03:09.120" style="s2">symptoms of ADHD it&#39;s because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.110" end="02:03:11.040" style="s2">exploratory you don&#39;t like to sit down</p>
<p begin="02:03:09.120" end="02:03:13.350" style="s2">you&#39;re full of ideas your attention</p>
<p begin="02:03:11.040" end="02:03:15.240" style="s2">scatters across a wide variety of topics</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.350" end="02:03:17.190" style="s2">and you&#39;re not very stable</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.240" end="02:03:22.290" style="s2">temperamental variation it&#39;s also much</p>
<p begin="02:03:17.190" end="02:03:25.320" style="s2">more common among boys panksepp showed</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.290" end="02:03:28.130" style="s2">same guy with rats that if you deprive</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.320" end="02:03:30.600" style="s2">young rats of rough and tumble play</p>
<p begin="02:03:28.130" end="02:03:33.330" style="s2">which is what the young boys are</p>
<p begin="02:03:30.600" end="02:03:37.770" style="s2">deprived of in school let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.330" end="02:03:39.480" style="s2">they get hyperactive and then their</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.770" end="02:03:40.560" style="s2">prefrontal cortexes don&#39;t develop very</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.480" end="02:03:42.210" style="s2">well because they&#39;re not having the</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.560" end="02:03:44.240" style="s2">right kind of experiences and that you</p>
<p begin="02:03:42.210" end="02:03:47.820" style="s2">can treat that quite effectively with</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.240" end="02:03:49.410" style="s2">psychomotor stimulants like ritalin so</p>
<p begin="02:03:47.820" end="02:03:51.450" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of an interesting bit of</p>
<p begin="02:03:49.410" end="02:03:53.910" style="s2">scientific information that no one pays</p>
<p begin="02:03:51.450" end="02:03:55.920" style="s2">any attention to there is also</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.910" end="02:03:57.840" style="s2">absolutely no evidence whatsoever that</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.920" end="02:04:00.180" style="s2">long-term use of psychomotor stimulants</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.840" end="02:04:02.760" style="s2">produces increases in cognitive gain</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.180" end="02:04:09.120" style="s2">zero and there&#39;s plenty of evidence that</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.760" end="02:04:15.660" style="s2">it&#39;s harmful so then the second part of</p>
<p begin="02:04:09.120" end="02:04:18.480" style="s2">that was what about adjustments for in</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.660" end="02:04:20.940" style="s2">the academic world say we disability</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.480" end="02:04:22.410" style="s2">adjustments it&#39;s like that&#39;s a such a</p>
<p begin="02:04:20.940" end="02:04:25.080" style="s2">rat&#39;s nest that I don&#39;t want to even</p>
<p begin="02:04:22.410" end="02:04:29.220" style="s2">discuss it I mean it it I&#39;ll discuss it</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.080" end="02:04:31.620" style="s2">for like 15 seconds there is a</p>
<p begin="02:04:29.220" end="02:04:33.870" style="s2">never-ending multiplication of</p>
<p begin="02:04:31.620" end="02:04:36.270" style="s2">disabilities that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.870" end="02:04:39.630" style="s2">right now the disability offices and the</p>
<p begin="02:04:36.270" end="02:04:41.520" style="s2">universities are swamped like I know</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.630" end="02:04:43.740" style="s2">some people have it rough like believe</p>
<p begin="02:04:41.520" end="02:04:45.780" style="s2">me I know that I was a problem I</p>
<p begin="02:04:43.740" end="02:04:48.090" style="s2">seriously know that I&#39;ve dealt with</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.780" end="02:04:52.320" style="s2">extraordinarily damaged people in my</p>
<p begin="02:04:48.090" end="02:04:55.560" style="s2">life here you&#39;re bloody hard pressed to</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.320" end="02:04:59.829" style="s2">find someone who doesn&#39;t have a serious</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.560" end="02:05:01.469" style="s2">problem or who doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:04:59.829" end="02:05:03.699" style="s2">his problem in a close family member</p>
<p begin="02:05:01.469" end="02:05:06.039" style="s2">it&#39;s like where do you draw the line</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.699" end="02:05:08.769" style="s2">with regards to disabilities well you</p>
<p begin="02:05:06.039" end="02:05:12.609" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t they multiply</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.769" end="02:05:14.979" style="s2">just like LGBT identities multiply just</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.609" end="02:05:17.229" style="s2">no really technically just like</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.979" end="02:05:19.809" style="s2">that just like intersectionality</p>
<p begin="02:05:17.229" end="02:05:23.019" style="s2">categories of oppression multiply it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:19.809" end="02:05:24.429" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s inevitable the way that you</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.019" end="02:05:27.129" style="s2">deal with it is you have objective</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.429" end="02:05:28.329" style="s2">standards you apply them to everyone not</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.129" end="02:05:31.899" style="s2">because that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.329" end="02:05:33.369" style="s2">it&#39;s not fair if you if your criteria</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.899" end="02:05:35.109" style="s2">for fairness is that everyone has the</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.369" end="02:05:37.629" style="s2">same outcome it&#39;s not fair at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.109" end="02:05:40.359" style="s2">not even close to fair it&#39;s just less</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.629" end="02:05:41.859" style="s2">tyrannical than the alternatives now we</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.359" end="02:05:44.199" style="s2">don&#39;t know that yet because we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:05:41.859" end="02:05:46.629" style="s2">seen the full range of the tyranny of</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.199" end="02:05:48.280" style="s2">the alternatives manifest itself not in</p>
<p begin="02:05:46.629" end="02:05:50.769" style="s2">our culture but it certainly did in</p>
<p begin="02:05:48.280" end="02:05:53.800" style="s2">other cultures I think it&#39;s a bad idea</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.769" end="02:06:00.010" style="s2">now I don&#39;t want to be absolute about</p>
<p begin="02:05:53.800" end="02:06:05.109" style="s2">that like it&#39;s tricky you know because</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.010" end="02:06:07.209" style="s2">if you have a disability that would</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.109" end="02:06:09.669" style="s2">allow you to do the work in the</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.209" end="02:06:12.249" style="s2">university and in the workplace with a</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.669" end="02:06:14.739" style="s2">modification then perhaps the</p>
<p begin="02:06:12.249" end="02:06:16.089" style="s2">modification could be made but I think</p>
<p begin="02:06:14.739" end="02:06:17.559" style="s2">that was done a lot better when that was</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.089" end="02:06:21.010" style="s2">in the hands of the professor&#39;s and not</p>
<p begin="02:06:17.559" end="02:06:22.510" style="s2">in the hands of these crazy bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="02:06:21.010" end="02:06:23.469" style="s2">structures that have risen up around the</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.510" end="02:06:25.749" style="s2">disability issue</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.469" end="02:06:27.399" style="s2">like they&#39;re one of the ten things that</p>
<p begin="02:06:25.749" end="02:06:29.469" style="s2">are going to kill the universities or</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.399" end="02:06:31.329" style="s2">maybe have already killed them possibly</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.469" end="02:06:32.949" style="s2">because they mean they&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.329" end="02:06:35.379" style="s2">corpses as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="02:06:32.949" end="02:06:38.889" style="s2">zombies so and that might be wrong but</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.379" end="02:06:40.300" style="s2">it&#39;s what it looks like to me first</p>
<p begin="02:06:38.889" end="02:06:42.789" style="s2">thing I want to say thank you so much</p>
<p begin="02:06:40.300" end="02:06:44.229" style="s2">those an amazing talk and I was</p>
<p begin="02:06:42.789" end="02:06:46.329" style="s2">wondering if you could elaborate what I</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.229" end="02:06:48.489" style="s2">noticed a lot ago here at UBC is that a</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.329" end="02:06:50.949" style="s2">lot of students and young people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.489" end="02:06:53.649" style="s2">often desensitized to for example the</p>
<p begin="02:06:50.949" end="02:06:56.499" style="s2">atrocities that communism or ideologies</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.649" end="02:06:58.329" style="s2">that forced terrorism and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.499" end="02:07:00.939" style="s2">some sort of Stockholm Syndrome that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.329" end="02:07:03.189" style="s2">seeing where it&#39;s like people are just</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.939" end="02:07:04.929" style="s2">their cat they&#39;re like trapped and they</p>
<p begin="02:07:03.189" end="02:07:07.269" style="s2">can&#39;t do they feel in a way they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.929" end="02:07:11.289" style="s2">do anything about it and then they start</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.269" end="02:07:12.850" style="s2">to like like like communism or they</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.289" end="02:07:15.220" style="s2">start to see more social sort</p>
<p begin="02:07:12.850" end="02:07:17.440" style="s2">socialist policy that in the end will</p>
<p begin="02:07:15.220" end="02:07:18.820" style="s2">get them killed we&#39;ll get them hurt as</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.440" end="02:07:20.830" style="s2">long as you kind of like elaborate down</p>
<p begin="02:07:18.820" end="02:07:22.870" style="s2">on what you think can be done about that</p>
<p begin="02:07:20.830" end="02:07:25.180" style="s2">or even if something can be done it will</p>
<p begin="02:07:22.870" end="02:07:27.190" style="s2">not respect well I think something can</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.180" end="02:07:31.690" style="s2">be done I mean I&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.190" end="02:07:35.410" style="s2">educate people about the horrors of the</p>
<p begin="02:07:31.690" end="02:07:37.120" style="s2">Nazi regime and the Soviet regime in</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.410" end="02:07:38.200" style="s2">particular I&#39;ve concentrated mostly on</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.120" end="02:07:44.740" style="s2">those two because but that&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="02:07:38.200" end="02:07:46.300" style="s2">and trying to let people know that it</p>

<p begin="02:07:58.000" end="02:08:01.990" style="s2">those steps are associated with trying</p>

<p begin="02:08:01.990" end="02:08:06.070" style="s2">actions because the stability of those</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.330" end="02:08:10.870" style="s2">systems depends on the willingness of</p>

<p begin="02:09:48.980" end="02:09:53.989" style="s2">evil were real more real than anything</p>
<p begin="02:09:51.650" end="02:09:57.710" style="s2">else wasn&#39;t because I learned that good</p>

<p begin="02:10:10.010" end="02:10:15.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s about you and there&#39;s no way</p>

<p begin="02:10:18.230" end="02:10:22.219" style="s2">it&#39;s like you want to imagine yourself</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.610" end="02:10:24.370" style="s2">as an ostrich guard that&#39;s a rough thing</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.219" end="02:10:26.780" style="s2">you see because you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="02:10:24.370" end="02:10:28.880" style="s2">see young said if you confronted the</p>
<p begin="02:10:26.780" end="02:10:30.739" style="s2">shadow which is the dark side of people</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.880" end="02:10:33.139" style="s2">the aggressive side the malevolent side</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.739" end="02:10:37.190" style="s2">that it it really reaches all the way</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.139" end="02:10:38.570" style="s2">down to hell and Dante sort of was</p>
<p begin="02:10:37.190" end="02:10:40.400" style="s2">trying to put forward the same thing</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.570" end="02:10:41.960" style="s2">when he wrote the inferno right with the</p>
<p begin="02:10:40.400" end="02:10:44.000" style="s2">levels of evil right because it was a</p>
<p begin="02:10:41.960" end="02:10:45.500" style="s2">voyage through the levels of evil right</p>
<p begin="02:10:44.000" end="02:10:49.250" style="s2">to the bottom he thought the bottom was</p>
<p begin="02:10:45.500" end="02:10:51.770" style="s2">betrayal it&#39;s pretty good the most the</p>
<p begin="02:10:49.250" end="02:10:54.080" style="s2">center of malevolence is betrayal I like</p>
<p begin="02:10:51.770" end="02:10:55.730" style="s2">that because to betray someone you have</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.080" end="02:10:56.630" style="s2">to get them to trust you and Trust is a</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.730" end="02:10:57.770" style="s2">moral virtue</p>
<p begin="02:10:56.630" end="02:11:00.080" style="s2">right especially if it&#39;s courageous</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.770" end="02:11:01.460" style="s2">Trust because it it puts you in</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.080" end="02:11:03.110" style="s2">alignment with other people and allows</p>
<p begin="02:11:01.460" end="02:11:04.969" style="s2">you to move forward into life and if you</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.110" end="02:11:05.540" style="s2">betray that you really it&#39;s like a knife</p>
<p begin="02:11:04.969" end="02:11:07.070" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.540" end="02:11:09.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like knife in the heart through the</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.070" end="02:11:12.170" style="s2">back especially if it&#39;s someone who love</p>
<p begin="02:11:09.560" end="02:11:14.360" style="s2">loves you betrays you and especially if</p>
<p begin="02:11:12.170" end="02:11:20.360" style="s2">they betray you for your virtues that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.360" end="02:11:22.820" style="s2">a really nice twist so I believe because</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.360" end="02:11:25.520" style="s2">I think that people are capable of good</p>
<p begin="02:11:22.820" end="02:11:29.060" style="s2">that if they know enough about evil that</p>
<p begin="02:11:25.520" end="02:11:31.130" style="s2">that will straighten them out so but who</p>
<p begin="02:11:29.060" end="02:11:33.170" style="s2">wants that you know this is one of the</p>
<p begin="02:11:31.130" end="02:11:34.969" style="s2">things I really like about Jung he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:33.170" end="02:11:39.300" style="s2">often regarded as a New Age thinker</p>
<p begin="02:11:34.969" end="02:11:41.940" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong he&#39;s no New Age thinker</p>
<p begin="02:11:39.300" end="02:11:45.090" style="s2">he knew that the the pathway to</p>
<p begin="02:11:41.940" end="02:11:47.960" style="s2">enlightenment was barred by the</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.090" end="02:11:50.489" style="s2">necessity of a passage through hell and</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.960" end="02:11:53.070" style="s2">that no one was going to do that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.489" end="02:11:55.739" style="s2">why there isn&#39;t a world full of</p>
<p begin="02:11:53.070" end="02:11:57.710" style="s2">enlightened people you might say like it</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.739" end="02:12:00.900" style="s2">was just a matter of doing nice things</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.710" end="02:12:04.469" style="s2">following your bliss let&#39;s say however</p>
<p begin="02:12:00.900" end="02:12:07.019" style="s2">you might put it then why wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.469" end="02:12:09.989" style="s2">everyone walk up the stairway to heaven</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.019" end="02:12:12.059" style="s2">that isn&#39;t how it works that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.989" end="02:12:13.769" style="s2">it works at all I don&#39;t think you can be</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.059" end="02:12:16.170" style="s2">convinced of the necessity for moral</p>

<p begin="02:12:18.030" end="02:12:22.789" style="s2">that it&#39;s your fault that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.530" end="02:12:27.329" style="s2">getting that way who wants to think that</p>
<p begin="02:12:22.789" end="02:12:33.019" style="s2">so you can think it though but not not</p>
<p begin="02:12:27.329" end="02:12:36.690" style="s2">without it burning you so thanks so much</p>
<p begin="02:12:33.019" end="02:12:40.289" style="s2">hello dr. Peterson thank you for coming</p>
<p begin="02:12:36.690" end="02:12:43.019" style="s2">we all appreciate it a lot I wanted to</p>

<p begin="02:13:01.050" end="02:13:06.269" style="s2">from Twitter who&#39;s gone in a very far</p>
<p begin="02:13:03.449" end="02:13:08.760" style="s2">left direction a YouTube has gone in</p>
<p begin="02:13:06.269" end="02:13:11.219" style="s2">very far left direction I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="02:13:08.760" end="02:13:14.989" style="s2">wondering I&#39;ve started an alternative to</p>
<p begin="02:13:11.219" end="02:13:17.429" style="s2">youtube called pew tube what kind of</p>
<p begin="02:13:14.989" end="02:13:21.150" style="s2">what do you see for possible solutions</p>
<p begin="02:13:17.429" end="02:13:24.059" style="s2">and just your thousand here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:13:21.150" end="02:13:26.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a crazy thought but I&#39;m gonna tell</p>
<p begin="02:13:24.059" end="02:13:28.440" style="s2">it to you anyways so I was just reading</p>
<p begin="02:13:26.039" end="02:13:30.059" style="s2">one of reycarts Wiles books I think it</p>
<p begin="02:13:28.440" end="02:13:31.909" style="s2">was called how to make a mind I really</p>
<p begin="02:13:30.059" end="02:13:34.199" style="s2">liked it actually</p>
<p begin="02:13:31.909" end="02:13:36.210" style="s2">it helped me understand how the brain</p>
<p begin="02:13:34.199" end="02:13:37.829" style="s2">compresses information because the world</p>
<p begin="02:13:36.210" end="02:13:40.170" style="s2">is really complicated a so you have to</p>
<p begin="02:13:37.829" end="02:13:42.420" style="s2">make a low-resolution representation of</p>
<p begin="02:13:40.170" end="02:13:43.860" style="s2">it to live in it and he actually</p>
<p begin="02:13:42.420" end="02:13:45.329" style="s2">explained to me in a way that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:13:43.860" end="02:13:47.340" style="s2">really understood how the brain might do</p>
<p begin="02:13:45.329" end="02:13:48.719" style="s2">that neurologically so that was cool but</p>
<p begin="02:13:47.340" end="02:13:52.440" style="s2">you know kurtzweil is this guy who</p>
<p begin="02:13:48.719" end="02:13:52.890" style="s2">thinks that he&#39;s a smart guy very smart</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.440" end="02:13:56.190" style="s2">guy</p>
<p begin="02:13:52.890" end="02:13:59.760" style="s2">and he&#39;s invented a fair bit of high-end</p>
<p begin="02:13:56.190" end="02:14:02.010" style="s2">technical technological software and</p>
<p begin="02:13:59.760" end="02:14:03.000" style="s2">hardware and he&#39;s the guy that thinks</p>
<p begin="02:14:02.010" end="02:14:04.770" style="s2">that we&#39;re heading towards the</p>
<p begin="02:14:03.000" end="02:14:07.830" style="s2">singularity and so the singularity is</p>
<p begin="02:14:04.770" end="02:14:09.810" style="s2">you know how processing speed doubles</p>
<p begin="02:14:07.830" end="02:14:12.570" style="s2">every 18 months and like hard disk</p>
<p begin="02:14:09.810" end="02:14:14.910" style="s2">capacity every year and there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="02:14:12.570" end="02:14:18.000" style="s2">of doublings going on a huge number of</p>
<p begin="02:14:14.910" end="02:14:20.940" style="s2">them and they accelerate exponentially</p>
<p begin="02:14:18.000" end="02:14:24.260" style="s2">and so it&#39;s probably we&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="02:14:20.940" end="02:14:27.090" style="s2">three years away maybe even less then</p>
<p begin="02:14:24.260" end="02:14:30.170" style="s2">from building a computer that has the</p>

<p begin="02:14:30.170" end="02:14:34.080" style="s2">reasonable estimates of the calculating</p>

<p begin="02:14:38.400" end="02:14:43.350" style="s2">years away something like that and then</p>
<p begin="02:14:41.970" end="02:14:45.360" style="s2">we&#39;re eighteen months away from having</p>
<p begin="02:14:43.350" end="02:14:46.860" style="s2">one that&#39;s twice that fast and then 18</p>
<p begin="02:14:45.360" end="02:14:48.990" style="s2">months away from having one that&#39;s twice</p>
<p begin="02:14:46.860" end="02:14:52.140" style="s2">as fast is that so that&#39;s like say six</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.990" end="02:14:54.330" style="s2">years and and we&#39;ve got something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:14:52.140" end="02:14:57.180" style="s2">eight times as smart as a human being</p>
<p begin="02:14:54.330" end="02:14:58.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s a twist on that and this is</p>

<p begin="02:14:58.680" end="02:15:01.710" style="s2">you make a machine smart enough to make</p>
<p begin="02:15:00.240" end="02:15:04.430" style="s2">the next machine that&#39;s smarter than it</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.710" end="02:15:07.350" style="s2">which is sort of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.430" end="02:15:09.150" style="s2">because computers are so fast that that</p>
<p begin="02:15:07.350" end="02:15:11.930" style="s2">will scale up to near infinite commuting</p>
<p begin="02:15:09.150" end="02:15:18.350" style="s2">computing power almost instantaneously</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.930" end="02:15:20.820" style="s2">now you think no probably not and Ellen</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.350" end="02:15:22.680" style="s2">gates partner has written critiques of</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.820" end="02:15:24.300" style="s2">kurtzweil and you know you might think</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.680" end="02:15:25.670" style="s2">if something is impossible then it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:15:24.300" end="02:15:28.530" style="s2">happen even if you don&#39;t know why and</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.670" end="02:15:31.860" style="s2">there&#39;s reasons to not think that that</p>
<p begin="02:15:28.530" end="02:15:33.810" style="s2">will happen but Kurzweil is traced to</p>
<p begin="02:15:31.860" end="02:15:35.760" style="s2">back the doubling of computing power way</p>
<p begin="02:15:33.810" end="02:15:38.160" style="s2">before the existence of the transistor</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.760" end="02:15:41.580" style="s2">and it&#39;s been ridiculously stable were</p>
<p begin="02:15:38.160" end="02:15:44.070" style="s2">crazily stable so god only knows what</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.580" end="02:15:45.480" style="s2">we&#39;re coming up with here you know and</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.070" end="02:15:47.250" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what something of</p>
<p begin="02:15:45.480" end="02:15:51.150" style="s2">infinite computing power might be like</p>
<p begin="02:15:47.250" end="02:15:53.190" style="s2">like you seriously don&#39;t know and there</p>
<p begin="02:15:51.150" end="02:15:55.020" style="s2">are serious people who are very very</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.190" end="02:15:56.970" style="s2">very worried about that they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="02:15:55.020" end="02:15:59.070" style="s2">worried for example that companies like</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.970" end="02:16:01.350" style="s2">Facebook and Google will manage that</p>
<p begin="02:15:59.070" end="02:16:04.250" style="s2">first and you know those companies are</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.350" end="02:16:06.539" style="s2">already making censorship AI bots and</p>
<p begin="02:16:04.250" end="02:16:08.249" style="s2">that&#39;s not that smart it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:16:06.539" end="02:16:10.199" style="s2">like making really fast robots that can</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.249" end="02:16:12.269" style="s2">shoot people it&#39;s not that smart and</p>
<p begin="02:16:10.199" end="02:16:14.129" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that too very rapidly and</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.269" end="02:16:16.229" style="s2">you know I know some guys who worked in</p>
<p begin="02:16:14.129" end="02:16:18.239" style="s2">advanced AI and you know how you look</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.229" end="02:16:19.889" style="s2">you watch the term Terminator movies and</p>
<p begin="02:16:18.239" end="02:16:21.659" style="s2">you see the robots that miss when they</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.889" end="02:16:24.239" style="s2">shoot at you like they&#39;re not very</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.659" end="02:16:26.010" style="s2">bright because the bright ones not only</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.239" end="02:16:27.299" style="s2">shoot at where you are but they estimate</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.010" end="02:16:28.589" style="s2">where you&#39;re gonna be when you make your</p>
<p begin="02:16:27.299" end="02:16:30.209" style="s2">escape moves and they shoot there</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.589" end="02:16:35.819" style="s2">simultaneously and their death rate is</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.209" end="02:16:37.409" style="s2">100% and so there&#39;s no war against the</p>
<p begin="02:16:35.819" end="02:16:38.670" style="s2">robots I mean when those things get</p>
<p begin="02:16:37.409" end="02:16:40.529" style="s2">going they&#39;re gonna be so much faster</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.670" end="02:16:47.460" style="s2">than us that will look like we&#39;re moving</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.529" end="02:16:49.139" style="s2">through molasses to them so you know so</p>
<p begin="02:16:47.460" end="02:16:50.519" style="s2">maybe what we&#39;re deciding now with all</p>
<p begin="02:16:49.139" end="02:16:51.840" style="s2">of our individual decisions about</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.519" end="02:16:53.399" style="s2">censorship in the way that we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="02:16:51.840" end="02:16:55.319" style="s2">to construct the world and all that is</p>
<p begin="02:16:53.399" end="02:16:57.899" style="s2">exactly what kind of super intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:16:55.319" end="02:16:59.399" style="s2">we&#39;re going to bring into being and I</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.899" end="02:17:01.199" style="s2">would suggest that we try to bring one</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.399" end="02:17:08.069" style="s2">in that&#39;s good and moral rather than one</p>
<p begin="02:17:01.199" end="02:17:14.489" style="s2">that&#39;s evil and demonic right so what</p>
<p begin="02:17:08.069" end="02:17:16.739" style="s2">can we do about that yeah there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="02:17:14.489" end="02:17:20.760" style="s2">one answer that as far as I know that</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.739" end="02:17:23.069" style="s2">works is gay Rock together you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.760" end="02:17:26.369" style="s2">be the person who&#39;s working in AI right</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.069" end="02:17:28.409" style="s2">I know some of these people it better be</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.369" end="02:17:29.460" style="s2">good people cuz they&#39;re gonna build</p>
<p begin="02:17:28.409" end="02:17:31.829" style="s2">whatever they&#39;re like into their</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.460" end="02:17:33.659" style="s2">machines so they better have their heads</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.829" end="02:17:36.149" style="s2">screwed on straight because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.659" end="02:17:38.099" style="s2">gonna get amplified like mad and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:17:36.149" end="02:17:40.170" style="s2">like what&#39;s happening with Google and</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.099" end="02:17:42.449" style="s2">Facebook and YouTube they&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="02:17:40.170" end="02:17:44.099" style="s2">censorship BOTS predicated on a certain</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.449" end="02:17:46.679" style="s2">kind of ideologies the kind of ideology</p>
<p begin="02:17:44.099" end="02:17:54.149" style="s2">that we outlined today it&#39;s a very bad</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.679" end="02:17:57.179" style="s2">idea hopefully good people will stop</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.149" end="02:17:59.429" style="s2">that so then that what that means is</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.179" end="02:18:01.649" style="s2">that your moral obligation is to be good</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.429" end="02:18:05.010" style="s2">and the way you do that is first by</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.649" end="02:18:07.590" style="s2">stopping being bad and everyone can do</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.010" end="02:18:10.920" style="s2">that a little bit so I hope that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.590" end="02:18:13.229" style="s2">everyone does because the consequences</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.920" end="02:18:18.409" style="s2">of not doing it are not going to be</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.229" end="02:18:18.409" style="s2">pleasant they never are thank you</p>
<p begin="02:18:18.500" end="02:18:24.679" style="s2">hi this question is about your biblical</p>
<p begin="02:18:20.840" end="02:18:26.210" style="s2">lecture series I like that one because</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.679" end="02:18:29.330" style="s2">it&#39;s about Genesis which is usually</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.210" end="02:18:30.710" style="s2">ignored as being were this post</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.330" end="02:18:33.230" style="s2">enlightenment society we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.710" end="02:18:34.820" style="s2">these ancient creation myths and also I</p>
<p begin="02:18:33.230" end="02:18:37.639" style="s2">thought revelations kind of gets the</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.820" end="02:18:40.429" style="s2">same treatment as being dismissed</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.639" end="02:18:43.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s the crazy hallucinogenic</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.429" end="02:18:45.080" style="s2">trip of some isolated madman in the</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.280" end="02:18:46.610" style="s2">middle of the Mediterranean mm-hmm so I</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.080" end="02:18:48.260" style="s2">was wondering if after you&#39;re done with</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.610" end="02:18:51.460" style="s2">Genesis if you were thinking about doing</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.260" end="02:18:54.920" style="s2">revelations not without traversing the</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.460" end="02:18:56.269" style="s2">geography in between okay</p>
<p begin="02:18:54.920" end="02:19:00.040" style="s2">yeah I want to walk through the whole</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.269" end="02:19:03.230" style="s2">thing if I can do that before I expire</p>
<p begin="02:19:00.040" end="02:19:05.990" style="s2">so I mean I&#39;ve read it and thought about</p>
<p begin="02:19:03.230" end="02:19:08.000" style="s2">it and like it&#39;s such a strange book</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.990" end="02:19:10.130" style="s2">because it&#39;s really big among the</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.000" end="02:19:13.400" style="s2">evangelical Republican types and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.130" end="02:19:15.769" style="s2">think really that really that&#39;s the book</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.400" end="02:19:19.429" style="s2">that&#39;s but you rely have you read it</p>
<p begin="02:19:15.769" end="02:19:20.719" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a crazy</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.429" end="02:19:23.120" style="s2">hallucinogenic trip</p>
<p begin="02:19:20.719" end="02:19:25.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what revelation is no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.120" end="02:19:29.750" style="s2">to play it down because god only knows</p>
<p begin="02:19:25.880" end="02:19:32.870" style="s2">about crazy hallucinogenic trips that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:29.750" end="02:19:35.660" style="s2">for sure I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s accruing</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.870" end="02:19:37.670" style="s2">evidence I would say that a tremendous</p>
<p begin="02:19:35.660" end="02:19:39.309" style="s2">amount of the religious orientation of</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.670" end="02:19:42.260" style="s2">human beings you know that deep</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.309" end="02:19:44.059" style="s2">mythological symbolic orientation is in</p>
<p begin="02:19:42.260" end="02:19:45.650" style="s2">no small part a consequence of</p>
<p begin="02:19:44.059" end="02:19:47.929" style="s2">humanity&#39;s experimentation with</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.650" end="02:19:50.030" style="s2">psychedelic substances I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:47.929" end="02:19:55.910" style="s2">that the evidence for that I think has</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.030" end="02:19:58.400" style="s2">become virtually overwhelming so anyways</p>
<p begin="02:19:55.910" end="02:20:00.440" style="s2">I will get there maybe probably not</p>
<p begin="02:19:58.400" end="02:20:01.910" style="s2">because at the rate I&#39;m going through</p>
<p begin="02:20:00.440" end="02:20:05.900" style="s2">the first stories it&#39;ll take me forever</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.910" end="02:20:10.430" style="s2">to get there really that&#39;s okay so thank</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.900" end="02:20:12.740" style="s2">you dr. Peterson thank you first of all</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.430" end="02:20:16.280" style="s2">it&#39;s great pleasure being here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.740" end="02:20:17.480" style="s2">awesome to see you live I basically got</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.280" end="02:20:19.820" style="s2">into your works just earlier this year</p>
<p begin="02:20:17.480" end="02:20:21.470" style="s2">and I had an original question but your</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.820" end="02:20:22.550" style="s2">talk today kind of made me decide to</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.470" end="02:20:27.170" style="s2">change my mind was can</p>
<p begin="02:20:22.550" end="02:20:28.880" style="s2">ask do you feel as though would you</p>
<p begin="02:20:27.170" end="02:20:31.399" style="s2">agree with me in the sentiment that the</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.880" end="02:20:33.170" style="s2">left is pushed so hard for a total</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.399" end="02:20:35.840" style="s2">control of our society over the last</p>

<p begin="02:20:35.840" end="02:20:42.229" style="s2">point we&#39;re saying 2013 was a different</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.970" end="02:20:44.390" style="s2">time would you say that because they</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.229" end="02:20:47.930" style="s2">pushed so hard they&#39;ve created this</p>
<p begin="02:20:44.390" end="02:20:49.819" style="s2">backlash and the backlash created caused</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.930" end="02:20:51.439" style="s2">them the backlash back again so they</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.819" end="02:20:53.870" style="s2">doubled down with their ideology and</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.439" end="02:20:57.319" style="s2">then they get they lose another argument</p>

<p begin="02:21:59.630" end="02:22:03.620" style="s2">observation is a really interesting one</p>
<p begin="02:22:01.490" end="02:22:06.200" style="s2">because you know that things can go out</p>
<p begin="02:22:03.620" end="02:22:07.580" style="s2">of hand very very rapidly yeah and the</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.200" end="02:22:09.620" style="s2">reason they do that is because of</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.580" end="02:22:11.510" style="s2">positive feedback loops know the thing</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.620" end="02:22:13.430" style="s2">that kurtzweil talks about is a positive</p>

<p begin="02:22:17.390" end="02:22:21.590" style="s2">a positive feedback loop and that can</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.859" end="02:22:23.780" style="s2">spiral upwards out of control very</p>
<p begin="02:22:21.590" end="02:22:27.319" style="s2">rapidly and that&#39;s what polarization is</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.780" end="02:22:31.729" style="s2">it&#39;s like I tap you you tap me I slap</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.319" end="02:22:33.470" style="s2">you you punch me well up it goes well I</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.729" end="02:22:34.819" style="s2">think that&#39;s partly why in the New</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.470" end="02:22:36.200" style="s2">Testament for example there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.819" end="02:22:39.990" style="s2">injunction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.200" end="02:22:43.979" style="s2">turn the other cheek resist not evil</p>
<p begin="02:22:39.990" end="02:22:45.390" style="s2">why because otherwise you get into a</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.979" end="02:22:47.280" style="s2">positive feedback loop and then you</p>
<p begin="02:22:45.390" end="02:22:49.710" style="s2">better look the hell out and things can</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.280" end="02:22:50.850" style="s2">tilt very very rapidly I mean no you</p>
<p begin="02:22:49.710" end="02:22:52.620" style="s2">have to do look at what happened in</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.850" end="02:22:58.740" style="s2">World War one no one expected that it</p>
<p begin="02:22:52.620" end="02:23:00.840" style="s2">was like one one relatively minor member</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.740" end="02:23:03.630" style="s2">I think of the aristocracy if I remember</p>
<p begin="02:23:00.840" end="02:23:07.080" style="s2">correctly was assassinated in one minor</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.630" end="02:23:09.000" style="s2">little country it&#39;s like bang everything</p>
<p begin="02:23:07.080" end="02:23:11.250" style="s2">fell apart and that&#39;s positive feedback</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.000" end="02:23:12.960" style="s2">loops right and so that&#39;s what we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:23:11.250" end="02:23:15.920" style="s2">right now and we got to be and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.960" end="02:23:19.410" style="s2">really chaotic time and so I would say</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.920" end="02:23:23.490" style="s2">maintain self-control and don&#39;t aim to</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.410" end="02:23:25.979" style="s2">win a matte piece because winning that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.490" end="02:23:28.560" style="s2">that&#39;s not peace it&#39;s better dame for</p>
<p begin="02:23:25.979" end="02:23:31.439" style="s2">peace you know I&#39;ve got this tour coming</p>
<p begin="02:23:28.560" end="02:23:32.850" style="s2">up in November 11th I&#39;m quite worried</p>
<p begin="02:23:31.439" end="02:23:34.290" style="s2">about it because I know there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.850" end="02:23:35.760" style="s2">be protesters there and that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.290" end="02:23:38.040" style="s2">been emboldened by the fact that they</p>
<p begin="02:23:35.760" end="02:23:39.510" style="s2">shot the talk down before and I want to</p>
<p begin="02:23:38.040" end="02:23:41.130" style="s2">make a video I&#39;ll probably do it</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.510" end="02:23:43.649" style="s2">tomorrow telling everyone that comes to</p>
<p begin="02:23:41.130" end="02:23:48.590" style="s2">that meeting to like watch their bloody</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.649" end="02:23:52.620" style="s2">step and stay out of the gutter because</p>
<p begin="02:23:48.590" end="02:23:54.660" style="s2">you just we&#39;re at we&#39;re at we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="02:23:52.620" end="02:23:57.210" style="s2">point now where under the wrong</p>
<p begin="02:23:54.660" end="02:24:00.120" style="s2">circumstances if the wrong person does</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.210" end="02:24:02.820" style="s2">the wrong thing that the consequences</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.120" end="02:24:05.580" style="s2">will be very grave now we can&#39;t predict</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.820" end="02:24:09.660" style="s2">which action is going to precipitate</p>
<p begin="02:24:05.580" end="02:24:12.000" style="s2">that and or even if that will happen but</p>
<p begin="02:24:09.660" end="02:24:15.479" style="s2">it&#39;s chaotic enough so that it could</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.000" end="02:24:17.610" style="s2">happen so you know so govern yourselves</p>
<p begin="02:24:15.479" end="02:24:19.530" style="s2">accordingly now the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.610" end="02:24:21.120" style="s2">there are people who would be happy if</p>
<p begin="02:24:19.530" end="02:24:22.620" style="s2">there was blood running in the street</p>
<p begin="02:24:21.120" end="02:24:24.570" style="s2">they&#39;re the same sort of people that</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.620" end="02:24:27.420" style="s2">shoot up high schools or kill innocent</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.570" end="02:24:28.950" style="s2">you know elementary school kids just to</p>
<p begin="02:24:27.420" end="02:24:31.530" style="s2">show what they&#39;re made of and what they</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.950" end="02:24:33.300" style="s2">believe and that&#39;s a big problem but for</p>
<p begin="02:24:31.530" end="02:24:35.399" style="s2">the rest of us like hopefully calmer</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.300" end="02:24:38.880" style="s2">heads can prevail and so it really is</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.399" end="02:24:42.689" style="s2">important not to win it&#39;s like fighting</p>
<p begin="02:24:38.880" end="02:24:44.520" style="s2">with your wife you don&#39;t win you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.689" end="02:24:47.130" style="s2">because you have to live with her you</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.520" end="02:24:49.930" style="s2">can&#39;t win but maybe you can solve the</p>
<p begin="02:24:47.130" end="02:24:51.790" style="s2">problem and bring about peace and so</p>
<p begin="02:24:49.930" end="02:24:54.010" style="s2">you gonna practice doing that practice</p>
<p begin="02:24:51.790" end="02:24:56.110" style="s2">restraint now and remember too that</p>
<p begin="02:24:54.010" end="02:24:58.390" style="s2">these people that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="02:24:56.110" end="02:25:02.260" style="s2">who erotica leftist is most of the time</p>
<p begin="02:24:58.390" end="02:25:04.030" style="s2">they&#39;re not like they&#39;re 95% like you</p>
<p begin="02:25:02.260" end="02:25:06.880" style="s2">and if you pull them out of the mob</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.030" end="02:25:08.860" style="s2">they&#39;re just like your your neighbors</p>
<p begin="02:25:06.880" end="02:25:11.320" style="s2">nineteen year old kid who&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.860" end="02:25:14.140" style="s2">clueless and rebellious right and who</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.320" end="02:25:15.790" style="s2">you might even like you put them in the</p>
<p begin="02:25:14.140" end="02:25:18.040" style="s2">mob it&#39;s a whole different thing and so</p>
<p begin="02:25:15.790" end="02:25:22.840" style="s2">you got to remember that to out of fear</p>
<p begin="02:25:18.040" end="02:25:25.360" style="s2">of social isolation no it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="02:25:22.840" end="02:25:28.900" style="s2">they&#39;re possessed by these ideas but but</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.360" end="02:25:32.050" style="s2">only partially you know you hardly find</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.900" end="02:25:34.630" style="s2">it full-blooded absolutely committed</p>
<p begin="02:25:32.050" end="02:25:36.580" style="s2">radical leftist activists you know like</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.630" end="02:25:39.490" style="s2">there are some but not very many most of</p>
<p begin="02:25:36.580" end="02:25:41.230" style="s2">it it&#39;s just fragmentary behavior and</p>
<p begin="02:25:39.490" end="02:25:43.210" style="s2">you have to remember that like when the</p>
<p begin="02:25:41.230" end="02:25:45.640" style="s2">students come out to protest me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.210" end="02:25:49.450" style="s2">a case particularly at McMaster I have</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.640" end="02:25:52.420" style="s2">to remember these kids they&#39;re not much</p>
<p begin="02:25:49.450" end="02:25:54.160" style="s2">different than my kids they are when</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.420" end="02:25:59.500" style="s2">they&#39;re in a stupid mob behind a hammer</p>
<p begin="02:25:54.160" end="02:26:01.710" style="s2">and sickle flag you know but but but you</p>
<p begin="02:25:59.500" end="02:26:04.620" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make a low-resolution</p>

<p begin="02:26:04.620" end="02:26:10.660" style="s2">so and so you that&#39;s why again I think</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.440" end="02:26:11.980" style="s2">instead of winning you turn to your own</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.660" end="02:26:14.500" style="s2">development you turn to your own</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.980" end="02:26:15.910" style="s2">development you do what you can to stop</p>
<p begin="02:26:14.500" end="02:26:17.710" style="s2">doing the things that you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.910" end="02:26:19.330" style="s2">aren&#39;t good because you&#39;re not gonna</p>

<p begin="02:26:19.330" end="02:26:23.561" style="s2">gonna do is help and otherwise you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:26:21.400" end="02:26:27.851" style="s2">participate in this polarization and</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.561" end="02:26:30.040" style="s2">that&#39;s unless you want that and you know</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.851" end="02:26:31.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a dark part of people that it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:26:31.780" end="02:26:36.190" style="s2">would like to burn things to the ground</p>
<p begin="02:26:33.910" end="02:26:37.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like to hell I know well how people</p>

<p begin="02:27:33.110" end="02:27:42.710" style="s2">you&#39;re the last one okay hi dr. Peterson</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.220" end="02:27:45.050" style="s2">thanks for coming my question is a</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.710" end="02:27:46.160" style="s2">little bit off-topic from everything</p>
<p begin="02:27:45.050" end="02:27:47.630" style="s2">else tonight but I really want to hear</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.160" end="02:27:52.540" style="s2">what you had to say about it</p>
<p begin="02:27:47.630" end="02:27:55.550" style="s2">I work in Residence Life here at UBC and</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.540" end="02:27:58.430" style="s2">in the community where I am we were</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.550" end="02:28:01.190" style="s2">recently affected by a suicide of</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.430" end="02:28:02.660" style="s2">someone who lived in our community and I</p>
<p begin="02:28:01.190" end="02:28:04.220" style="s2">was upset about it not just because</p>
<p begin="02:28:02.660" end="02:28:07.610" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s a horrible thing to have</p>
<p begin="02:28:04.220" end="02:28:09.260" style="s2">happen but also because res life in the</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.610" end="02:28:12.230" style="s2">university like they talk all this talk</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.260" end="02:28:13.690" style="s2">about like self care and your mental</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.230" end="02:28:16.101" style="s2">health is so important to us but then</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.690" end="02:28:18.740" style="s2">things like this still happens so I</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.101" end="02:28:20.510" style="s2">wanted to know like if you think like</p>
<p begin="02:28:18.740" end="02:28:22.460" style="s2">what do you think the university should</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.510" end="02:28:31.570" style="s2">be doing to keep stuff like this from</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.460" end="02:28:34.250" style="s2">happening in the future well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:28:31.570" end="02:28:36.890" style="s2">self-evident that it&#39;s the university&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.250" end="02:28:39.950" style="s2">responsibility and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.890" end="02:28:42.320" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t okay I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.950" end="02:28:44.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not self-evident that it is because</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.320" end="02:28:47.000" style="s2">different institutions can only do so</p>
<p begin="02:28:44.900" end="02:28:49.460" style="s2">many things you know and we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.000" end="02:28:52.970" style="s2">requiring that universities to educate</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.460" end="02:28:55.851" style="s2">and to act as substitute parents</p>
<p begin="02:28:52.970" end="02:28:59.900" style="s2">increasingly and to take on the role of</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.851" end="02:29:05.300" style="s2">judge jury and executioner as there are</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.900" end="02:29:09.040" style="s2">more what should be criminal cases being</p>
<p begin="02:29:05.300" end="02:29:09.040" style="s2">handled within the university say</p>
<p begin="02:29:12.051" end="02:29:16.081" style="s2">having said that you could ask the</p>
<p begin="02:29:14.251" end="02:29:19.950" style="s2">broader question is will what do you do</p>
<p begin="02:29:16.081" end="02:29:21.601" style="s2">to help people be sufficiently in love</p>
<p begin="02:29:19.950" end="02:29:25.291" style="s2">with life so that they don&#39;t wish to end</p>
<p begin="02:29:21.601" end="02:29:27.240" style="s2">it no and I&#39;ve tried to puzzle through</p>
<p begin="02:29:25.291" end="02:29:28.561" style="s2">that for a long time and that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="02:29:27.240" end="02:29:30.240" style="s2">why I&#39;ve written the things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.561" end="02:29:32.271" style="s2">written it&#39;s partly why I&#39;ve produced</p>
<p begin="02:29:30.240" end="02:29:36.990" style="s2">the online programs that I&#39;ve produced</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.271" end="02:29:38.490" style="s2">no and so we know that if you do if you</p>
<p begin="02:29:36.990" end="02:29:39.900" style="s2">have students do the future authoring</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.490" end="02:29:41.820" style="s2">program for example they&#39;re much less</p>
<p begin="02:29:39.900" end="02:29:43.921" style="s2">likely to drop out of university about</p>
<p begin="02:29:41.820" end="02:29:45.421" style="s2">30% less likely and their grades go up</p>
<p begin="02:29:43.921" end="02:29:49.171" style="s2">and that&#39;s especially true if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:29:45.421" end="02:29:52.051" style="s2">male and marginalized it has a bigger</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.171" end="02:29:53.221" style="s2">impact on those communities and so you</p>
<p begin="02:29:52.051" end="02:29:54.870" style="s2">know I&#39;ve tried to get universities</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.221" end="02:29:57.001" style="s2">interested now the doubt is there but</p>
<p begin="02:29:54.870" end="02:29:59.120" style="s2">they&#39;re not and it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="02:29:57.001" end="02:30:05.221" style="s2">get a big bureaucracy to move a like big</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.120" end="02:30:06.570" style="s2">big is a mobile so I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.221" end="02:30:08.551" style="s2">anything they can really do about it</p>
<p begin="02:30:06.570" end="02:30:09.900" style="s2">it&#39;s certainly possible that the things</p>
<p begin="02:30:08.551" end="02:30:11.761" style="s2">that they&#39;re trying to do about it are</p>
<p begin="02:30:09.900" end="02:30:13.051" style="s2">making it worse you know that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.761" end="02:30:15.601" style="s2">thing that you learn if you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="02:30:13.051" end="02:30:16.740" style="s2">social scientist just like there was</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.601" end="02:30:18.391" style="s2">evidence and I don&#39;t know if this is</p>
<p begin="02:30:16.740" end="02:30:20.910" style="s2">still the case but but there was good</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.391" end="02:30:22.591" style="s2">evidence I looked into this about 15</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.910" end="02:30:25.291" style="s2">years ago say you want to prevent</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.591" end="02:30:27.450" style="s2">suicides you put a suicide hotline in</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.291" end="02:30:30.421" style="s2">your town and you advertise it what</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.450" end="02:30:32.881" style="s2">happens suicide rate goes up because</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.421" end="02:30:35.221" style="s2">you&#39;re advertising suicide right and</p>
<p begin="02:30:32.881" end="02:30:37.230" style="s2">lots of lots of interventions are like</p>
<p begin="02:30:35.221" end="02:30:39.541" style="s2">that it&#39;s really really hard to make</p>
<p begin="02:30:37.230" end="02:30:41.971" style="s2">things better and it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.541" end="02:30:43.801" style="s2">easy to make them worse and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.971" end="02:30:45.240" style="s2">another problem you get these big</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.801" end="02:30:46.950" style="s2">bureaucracies let&#39;s say and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.240" end="02:30:48.360" style="s2">hypothetically motivated by positive</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.950" end="02:30:50.400" style="s2">intentions and I would say</p>
<p begin="02:30:48.360" end="02:30:51.900" style="s2">hypothetically again because it takes an</p>
<p begin="02:30:50.400" end="02:30:54.360" style="s2">awful lot of work to help someone</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.900" end="02:30:56.490" style="s2">straight now it&#39;s no joke especially if</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.360" end="02:31:01.051" style="s2">they&#39;re in real trouble and they put in</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.490" end="02:31:02.400" style="s2">place these structures that are designed</p>
<p begin="02:31:01.051" end="02:31:04.831" style="s2">to help but they don&#39;t ever evaluate</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.400" end="02:31:10.320" style="s2">them and they could easily be making it</p>
<p begin="02:31:04.831" end="02:31:12.110" style="s2">worse so so I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.320" end="02:31:17.551" style="s2">straightforward answer to that question</p>
<p begin="02:31:12.110" end="02:31:21.080" style="s2">I think that well that&#39;s that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.551" end="02:31:23.540" style="s2">answer I have yeah thank you okay</p>
<p begin="02:31:21.080" end="02:31:25.010" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s the end of the show if</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.540" end="02:31:26.060" style="s2">you&#39;re in the first two rows you can</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.010" end="02:31:29.440" style="s2">stick around and get some pictures</p>
<p begin="02:31:26.060" end="02:31:43.959" style="s2">otherwise drive safe and yeah</p>
<p begin="02:31:29.440" end="02:31:43.959" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
