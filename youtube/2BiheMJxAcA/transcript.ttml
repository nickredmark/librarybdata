<p begin="00:00:35.040" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">discussions in the discord uh about the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.680" end="00:00:42.559" style="s2">the four ps</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">and there&#39;s been some you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.559" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:46.239" style="s2">discussion over what your exact</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">definitions</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.239" end="00:00:50.239" style="s2">of perspectival knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">participatory knowing and really what</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.239" end="00:00:53.920" style="s2">the difference is</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.440" style="s2">between them and then so i i was</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:57.920" style="s2">wondering if you could just clarify</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">your definitions for those two p&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.920" end="00:01:02.239" style="s2">then i&#39;d like to turn to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">to mark and and and manual who have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.239" end="00:01:05.600" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.880" style="s2">playing around with uh with the four ps</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:08.640" style="s2">themselves and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.880" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">uh they could talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:13.680" style="s2">what they&#39;ve been playing with</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:15.119" style="s2">uh and maybe get your your thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.680" end="00:01:17.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.119" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">so sure i just want to interrupt here a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.119" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">if if we can get the reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">definition as well that would be great</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">what do you mean the justification for</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">the the definitions that what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">by the reason</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:37.119" style="s2">well yeah like why it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">the definition is that way</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">sure sure okay so</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">there&#39;s many ways of trying to cut this</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">up i guess i&#39;m trying to think of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:53.600" style="s2">a succinct way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">so the idea of perspectival knowing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.600" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">based on the idea of knowing what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:02:00.320" style="s2">like to be here</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">now in this state of consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.320" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">i know what it&#39;s like to be here now um</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">in my current state of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">my room</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:10.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m salience landscaping in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.720" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">and i have a sober state of mind i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">sane</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:18.959" style="s2">and so my salience landscaping is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">unfolding in a particular way so</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.959" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">i know what it&#39;s like to be here now</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:28.640" style="s2">um sober and that would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">a particular perspective and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.640" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">why i use perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">is we we have we have this prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">of this feature of salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:42.160" style="s2">from a state of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">like a perspective things things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.160" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">salient to me that seem in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">centered on me both spatially</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">and temporally um it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">something that i can modify</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:55.360" style="s2">by sort of shifting how i&#39;m framing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.360" end="00:02:58.640" style="s2">very much like an artistic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.640" end="00:03:05.120" style="s2">the term perspectival knowing is used</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.680" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">respectable knowing gives you a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.120" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s sought after in video</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:12.400" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">and that sense of presence i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.400" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">reflects the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">that you have a situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">you&#39;re finding things salient here now</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:28.159" style="s2">in a way that is efficacious or you</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">applying your skills or acquiring skills</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.159" end="00:03:33.760" style="s2">that you do not have</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:36.879" style="s2">um so in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.760" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">uh perspectival awareness is more basic</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.879" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">uh than procedural awareness since</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">procedural</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">knowing uh presupposes the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.879" style="s2">of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">now respectable knowing is all about</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.879" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">salience landscaping how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:53.280" style="s2">sizing up situations getting a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">optimal grip on them</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.280" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">um so that you have a sense of presence</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">both of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">and the world that&#39;s another thing a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:02.319" style="s2">perspective does it makes things sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">co-present</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.319" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">uh to each other participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">is a more primordial more basic form</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">uh part of the difficulty that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:13.920" style="s2">have with this is many people carry sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:14.879" style="s2">of in what&#39;s called an internalist view</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.920" end="00:04:16.959" style="s2">of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.879" end="00:04:18.320" style="s2">that to know something requires that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.959" end="00:04:19.280" style="s2">know that you know it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.320" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">there&#39;s been there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">philosophical arguments and evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">that that can&#39;t be a defining feature of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">uh and this is what&#39;s led to its cons</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">what has become to be known as</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">externalism that there are many things</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.880" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">without knowing that you know and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">fact you need you have to rely on that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">presupposition even</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.639" end="00:04:40.240" style="s2">even to bring up certain questions about</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">rationality and ethics i won&#39;t go into</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.240" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">those long arguments in detail</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:47.919" style="s2">so participatory knowing is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.919" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">that results from the way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">organism</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">and the environment are mutually shaped</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">to each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:05:00.960" style="s2">so that affordances emerge affordances</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">are taken to be real relations</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.960" end="00:05:05.840" style="s2">um and there&#39;s three there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">three levels at which human beings</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.840" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">uh participate in that mutual shaping of</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">organism in world one of course is</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:16.720" style="s2">biological</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">our evolutionary heritage has shaped our</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.720" end="00:05:21.680" style="s2">environment and us to our environment</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:23.360" style="s2">so that certain things are come out as</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.680" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">affordances to me certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.360" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">uh terrain features are walkable certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.840" end="00:05:29.440" style="s2">things are graspable</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:31.759" style="s2">certain certain things are visible to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.440" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">uh most of the electromagnetic spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.759" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">is not visible to me for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that&#39;s known as niche</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:42.080" style="s2">um and then of course because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:44.000" style="s2">human beings we have culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">and what culture does is mutually shape</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.000" end="00:05:46.479" style="s2">us to the environment and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">environment to you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">so look around you you&#39;re in a room</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:51.919" style="s2">probably i would</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:53.039" style="s2">right so most of your environment has</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.919" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">been shaped</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.039" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">by tools to fit you but nevertheless you</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:05:58.880" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:05:59.680" style="s2">have been uh shaped to fit that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.880" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.680" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">uh you wear clothes you learn right</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:04.880" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:07.039" style="s2">attitudes and behaviors etc the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.880" end="00:06:09.840" style="s2">process of enculturation</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.039" end="00:06:11.360" style="s2">and then of course on top of that is and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.840" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">i can&#39;t go into this in great detail i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:14.639" style="s2">presume and i hope it&#39;s not too</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">presumptuous that people are aware of</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.639" end="00:06:18.880" style="s2">what i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:22.080" style="s2">there&#39;s the online there&#39;s the online</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.880" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">continual mutual shaping</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.080" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">um that&#39;s going on in relevance</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:27.440" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">which is making which is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.440" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">cognitive niche construction</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">so for example i have a mug here and i</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">pick up this mug</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">and part of it is right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">shaping of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:41.120" style="s2">of the environments things of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:43.199" style="s2">size and stability</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.120" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">and configuration are graspable by my</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.199" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">hand that&#39;s a real affordance</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:48.800" style="s2">and then of course culture has shaped uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">object so that it&#39;s usable by me as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">tool and it&#39;ll also shape me</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">how to drink we have to learn how to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.919" style="s2">this babies can&#39;t use mugs for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">and then of course right now there&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.919" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">online relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">that is where i can use it to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">problems that i&#39;m currently in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">so all of that participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">that mutual shaping of self and world</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">creates a whole field of affordances for</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">of course most of those field most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">those affordances</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:23.199" style="s2">are going unnoticed and unused by me</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:25.039" style="s2">that wall over there right next to me i</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.199" end="00:07:25.840" style="s2">could it&#39;s i can lean on it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.039" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">leanable</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.840" end="00:07:29.199" style="s2">but like you know i wasn&#39;t noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">or or</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.199" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">or or becoming aware of that until i</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">made it salient</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:37.360" style="s2">so the perspectival knowing makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">salient</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.360" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">those affordances that are needed</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:46.160" style="s2">to be actualized right now so the pers</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">the participatory knowing creates the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.160" end="00:07:49.840" style="s2">agent arena relationship opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:51.520" style="s2">field of affordances</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:53.039" style="s2">and this is important because without</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.520" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">that we&#39;d just be hitting continual</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.039" end="00:07:56.639" style="s2">combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">and then there&#39;s another layer this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.639" end="00:07:59.199" style="s2">recursive relevance realization that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.199" end="00:08:03.759" style="s2">on top of that is perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">which does the salience landscaping it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.759" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">makes certain affordances</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">salient to me and i get this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">presence</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:13.120" style="s2">i get a situational awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.840" style="s2">situational awareness</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.120" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">in turn affords me paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.360" style="s2">to which i can apply my skills or from</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">which i can apply my skills</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.360" end="00:08:25.680" style="s2">and then once i have a a a specific set</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">of skills</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.680" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">about social interaction and drawing</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">implications etc</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">then i get into propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">why do i</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">i do the why do i pick the the four i</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:39.760" style="s2">pick</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">because i you can show dependency</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.760" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">relationships to them so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">causal justification</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:45.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s a systematic relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.920" end="00:08:52.320" style="s2">which i just gave each one has</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:55.519" style="s2">a uh a definable set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.320" end="00:08:56.560" style="s2">um results and phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.519" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">normativity</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">propositional knowing works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">beliefs that produce theories that give</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:05.120" style="s2">us a sense of conviction</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">procedural knowing works in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.120" end="00:09:08.320" style="s2">sensory motor interactions that produce</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:11.360" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.320" end="00:09:14.240" style="s2">of power um</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.360" end="00:09:16.000" style="s2">perspectival knowing as i said uh works</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.240" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">in terms of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.000" end="00:09:19.839" style="s2">perspective salience landscaping that</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">gives us a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.839" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">a presence and guides our situational</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:27.680" style="s2">and the participatory knowing as i said</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">gives us affordances</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.680" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">when we get a phenom and it&#39;s not needed</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">but when we have a phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:36.800" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">of participatory knowing it&#39;s usually in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.800" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">terms of the way</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:41.760" style="s2">it is ramifying through the other kinds</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">of knowing and that we have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.760" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">belonging we have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">the the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">is plugging well into the procedural is</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:51.839" style="s2">plugging well into the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s plugging well</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.839" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">into our environment with effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">recursive relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">so each one have has a different</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:02.880" style="s2">phenomenological normativity</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">the first results in theories the second</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.880" end="00:10:07.120" style="s2">results and skills the third results</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.399" style="s2">in perspective and then the fourth</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.120" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">results in</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.399" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">you know agent arena relationships</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">and so i guess that&#39;s enough for now</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">there&#39;s i mean i have a lot more to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">about all of this but</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">my basic justification for that is i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:25.040" style="s2">tell you what is known</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">like knowing that knowing how knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.040" end="00:10:29.440" style="s2">what it&#39;s like etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">i can tell you what it results in i can</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.440" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">result</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">i can tell you it&#39;s normative condition</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">and i can show you</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">the principled relationships of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">causation and dependence between them</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">so i mean like any taxonomy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">justified</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">by its cleanness its distinctiveness</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:48.079" style="s2">its coherence etc so that&#39;s my basic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.600" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.079" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">in kind of a nutshell all right</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.600" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">thank you for that i&#39;m going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">listen to that again a few times and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">then i&#39;ll so i i i i&#39;ve given a recent</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">version of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">this at uh the movement summit um and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">was recorded as a talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:07.920" style="s2">and i got a lot of positive feedback on</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:11.200" style="s2">that and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.920" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">uh rafe kelly who organizes summit is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.200" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">right now that talk is behind a paywall</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.000" style="s2">but it is going to be released to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.959" style="s2">general public soon</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.000" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">well great so mark and manuel did you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.959" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">to present what you were thinking of now</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">or did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">think about his response and do it next</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">time what did you what did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:32.720" style="s2">well i&#39;m uh i&#39;m fresh off explaining</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:34.640" style="s2">this earlier today so i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.720" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">i think we can give it another go and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.640" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">better go based on uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:39.519" style="s2">based on some sort of stuff that we that</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.519" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">talked about today with somebody um</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">so john one of the things we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">working on and a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">contributed</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:51.279" style="s2">you know andre and emmanuel and i have</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">been working very close on this and a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.279" end="00:11:54.880" style="s2">bunch of other people and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">probably too many to name so i apologize</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.880" end="00:11:57.920" style="s2">that i can&#39;t name everybody i mean nick</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">nick helped us tremendously with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.920" end="00:12:01.440" style="s2">of this work</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">so i i&#39;m doing a lot of reverse</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.440" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">engineering</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.079" style="s2">right from the perspective of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t have a meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.079" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">and didn&#39;t really realize that people</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:13.360" style="s2">could because why i fixed mine</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">like what&#39;s wrong with all you so um</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.360" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">so that that&#39;s one of the reasons why i</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">really resonated with like jordan</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">peterson and then and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">your work which is uh which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:22.480" style="s2">you know a much broader in in scope with</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.480" end="00:12:26.320" style="s2">with the whole science of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">crisis and the framework to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.320" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">which is very helpful when you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:32.560" style="s2">to help other people uh to get out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">this meaning crisis thing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.560" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">that you know you don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">good handle on so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:41.519" style="s2">one of the problems that i think we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">recognized was that in order for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.519" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:45.839" style="s2">to in order to do the things i think</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">would work from my reverse engineered</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.839" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">i needed to uh to reconceive of a few</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">and a bunch of people like i said help</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">help to sort of figure out</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:59.839" style="s2">where the missing pieces were in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:02.920" style="s2">sense and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.839" end="00:13:05.440" style="s2">what we came to was something like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.920" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">perspectival seems to be wrapped up in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.440" end="00:13:12.320" style="s2">all the types of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">and so from from our perspective</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.320" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s a deeper structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:17.760" style="s2">right because in order to know anything</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:18.639" style="s2">you have to know it in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.760" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.639" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">and the thing that handles relations in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:24.000" style="s2">general</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">is your framing device which is roughly</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.000" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">coming from your perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:32.040" style="s2">uh system and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:35.120" style="s2">the features that we think that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.040" end="00:13:38.480" style="s2">perspectival system has in particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.120" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">are are things like</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.480" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">flexibility and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:47.199" style="s2">missing in some people and we conceive</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:50.160" style="s2">of it as a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.199" end="00:13:51.519" style="s2">and so maybe it gets tired for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.160" end="00:13:53.360" style="s2">right like maybe you&#39;re just your</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.519" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">perspectival capacity goes down during</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.360" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">the day or something</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s probably true of the types of</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.399" style="s2">knowing as well but</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.920" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">you kind of need that perspective first</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.399" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">a piece of information can be knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:13.600" style="s2">because because that has to come first</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">in order to provide the the information</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.600" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">a frame to be to be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">in any fashion and if that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s a capacity and it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:26.320" style="s2">flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.560" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">then this explains a bunch of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.320" end="00:14:29.600" style="s2">about why people</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:31.279" style="s2">are unable to engage at certain levels</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.600" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">so a lot of people seem to be what i</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.279" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">call perspectivally stuck</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:37.360" style="s2">yes and then there&#39;s some people that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.639" style="s2">seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.360" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">perspectively broken right like they you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.639" end="00:14:44.240" style="s2">explain something to them about their</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">perspective that&#39;s obviously wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.240" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">and they can&#39;t they can&#39;t get there in</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:51.199" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">and so when we made that move</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.199" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">it sort of left a hole and the at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">same time the other line of reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">was something like</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">well you know we&#39;ve got the we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:05.199" style="s2">the propositional and the way you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">navigate the propositional space</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.199" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">seems to have something to do with</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">procedural</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">yes and i&#39;ve conceived of the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.399" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:17.760" style="s2">not not exclusively but maybe at its</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.399" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">base level logic reason and rationality</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.760" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">and one of the things i&#39;ve noticed about</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">uh about uh the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">is that if you pick a starting point</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">and your propositions are set your</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">ending point is guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">so it&#39;s a very safe space to operate in</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.320" style="s2">in some sense because you can build a</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">knowable world or a knowable perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.320" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">and as long as you use those two tools</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">you can know the whole thing at least in</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">uh and and that gives you a great deal</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">of safety and i think that&#39;s part and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">parcel to the to the meaning crisis in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">and then and then of course we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">mapping all this on the sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:58.959" style="s2">and and and i&#39;m sort of conceiving as</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">those two as discrete processing</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.959" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">of signals so if they were signals if</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:03.839" style="s2">the ways of knowing were more signal</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">types</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.839" end="00:16:07.519" style="s2">they would be getting sampled discretely</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">on that side</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.519" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">and then on the other side we have no</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">issue with</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">participatory we think that&#39;s fine um</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">it seems it seems good but the</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">the thing that comes up is what there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:24.399" style="s2">no navigational skill</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:26.800" style="s2">with the participatory like it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.399" end="00:16:29.360" style="s2">movement right it&#39;s just the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.800" end="00:16:31.040" style="s2">to go around a space in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.360" end="00:16:33.199" style="s2">and interact with things</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.040" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">but the interaction doesn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.199" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">whether or not it&#39;s right or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">and so we kind of figured we needed more</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:42.959" style="s2">of a compass in that space</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">and then what we came at independently</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.959" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">and then realized</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:49.360" style="s2">that mary cohen had already come to this</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:52.480" style="s2">was this parabolic way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.360" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">but our our justification for parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.480" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">is something like this is where</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">symbol and metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:04.480" style="s2">uh come into play right and parables in</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">particular so</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.480" end="00:17:09.360" style="s2">story fragments things like that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:11.280" style="s2">those are sort of the base structures</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.360" end="00:17:14.559" style="s2">that give you the ability</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.280" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">to do participation with the special</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.559" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">sort of added feature that um that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">at least one way sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:27.520" style="s2">and but usually multiple ways sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">and then multiple exit points</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.520" end="00:17:31.919" style="s2">and so you can take those chunks and</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">sort of apply them in different</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.919" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">situations</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">and and or in different perspectives and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">and you still have a choice of changing</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:42.000" style="s2">how it ends</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.520" style="s2">so you can find yourself in the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.000" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">situation but not</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.520" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">end up at the same result even though</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">you have exactly the same landscape and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.280" style="s2">tool set</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:55.840" style="s2">so that was sort of our justification</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:58.559" style="s2">for for the parabolic way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.840" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">and and why we think it&#39;s important and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.559" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">then the parabolic would also</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">hold things like like uh would also be</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:06.559" style="s2">with things like memes although we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">a whole space for</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.559" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">for means now but but but what do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">what do you what are your first</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:13.440" style="s2">impressions of that sort of a model</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">well there was a lot there so i&#39;ll try</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.440" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">to respond to many points</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:21.039" style="s2">going in um uh first of all</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:22.480" style="s2">i i have a concern about confusing</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.039" end="00:18:23.679" style="s2">language or training and language of</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.480" end="00:18:26.880" style="s2">explaining here</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.679" end="00:18:30.000" style="s2">i think that the perspective of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.880" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">often comes first although not always um</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.000" end="00:18:34.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">when we try to train train or intervene</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.400" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">um so it would seem in that way that all</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">the other kinds of knowing are dependent</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">on it but if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">if you talk about uh causal um</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">the for example the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">realization machinery is deeper than</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">your conscious awareness and makes it</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:52.080" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.080" end="00:18:56.160" style="s2">processing going on it&#39;s doing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">mutual shaping and participation</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.160" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">that actually makes consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:01.200" style="s2">possible but you have to be careful are</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:03.840" style="s2">you talking about order</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.200" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">in terms of accessibility of training or</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.840" end="00:19:07.840" style="s2">order in</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">uh in order an</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.840" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">explanation of causation</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:20.320" style="s2">so i would want to make clear i would</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:22.640" style="s2">be worried about making claims about</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.320" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">patterns by which we want to intervene</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.640" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">as being</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">directly mappable on patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.840" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">ontology of the four kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:33.919" style="s2">and so uh that&#39;s why i was i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">make the perspectival the most</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.919" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">foundational because</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">it causally can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">because you know if i if i mess up</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">certain areas of your brain that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">processing unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">that will massively affect your</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">perspectival knowing outside</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">of your self-awareness etc etc um</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">part of what you&#39;re putting your finger</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">on though is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:04.159" style="s2">do you think we need to keep the those</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">two ways of thinking about the four</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.159" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">kinds of knowing distinct</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">but we need to talk about the difference</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:12.559" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.520" end="00:20:14.159" style="s2">the causal relationship between them</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:15.840" style="s2">and the way we need to talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.159" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">in order to train them</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.840" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">you know and i use the examples of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">language you use to train uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">memory is a perspectival thing you use</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:26.480" style="s2">the memory palace but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">that that&#39;s how we actually participate</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.480" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">in our memory our memory doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">that kind of perspectival fashion at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">um and so the training language and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">explaining language</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">they have to be kept clearly um distinct</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">and not confused</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">but i do think that you&#39;re making an</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">important point i would say</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">um about more work needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">relating</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:52.080" style="s2">um that explaining language to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">training language</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.080" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">um yeah i hadn&#39;t thought about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:21:00.080" style="s2">enough i&#39;m just sort of reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:04.640" style="s2">this right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.080" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a so there&#39;s a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">explaining and giving people the right</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">tools for intervening and of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">respectable knowing is going to seem</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:18.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s the first because when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">trying to intervene on people</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.320" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">we&#39;re relying to a significant degree on</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">their self-awareness which is located</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">in the prospective knowing so that makes</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.080" style="s2">sense to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">so how do we how do we manage that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.080" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i i got to think about this</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:32.960" style="s2">this is a this is a really important</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.840" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">about the participatory knowing so uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">is that narrative is a way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">actually bridge between all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">knowing that was my response to mary</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">that in narrative uh we use propositions</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">uh to talk about interactions procedural</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">in order to get people&#39;s points of view</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">in order</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:58.799" style="s2">to ultimately talk about how people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:00.240" style="s2">identities are changed</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.799" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s the whole point of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.240" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">narrative gives us a temporally extended</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.919" style="s2">it opens up the scope in which the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">mutual shaping between</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.919" end="00:22:13.120" style="s2">uh agent and arena works that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:14.880" style="s2">have to teach narrative to people</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.120" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">we have to teach them and teach them and</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.880" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">practice it and practice it and practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:20.880" style="s2">because what it does is it actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">integrates the four kinds of knowing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.880" end="00:22:25.120" style="s2">a particular way</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:27.679" style="s2">and affords extending the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.120" end="00:22:28.880" style="s2">agent arena relationship the world is</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.679" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">opened up and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.880" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">scope of agencies opened up that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:33.520" style="s2">of course you don&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:35.520" style="s2">four-year-olds to engage</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.520" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">in the long-term planning that you would</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.520" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">expect 40-year-olds to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">etc so not i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think therefore of uh the</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:46.799" style="s2">parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.640" style="s2">as a separate kind of knowing the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.799" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">problem is when you start to define</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.640" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">uh the kinds of knowing into in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:54.159" style="s2">the products produced you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">get a proliferation of kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.159" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">because then you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">scientific knowing you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">symbolic knowing</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">right you&#39;re going to get historical</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:02.720" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get all different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.480" style="s2">of knowing and so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">problems i brought up with mary that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.480" end="00:23:10.960" style="s2">why i tried to limit</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">the kinds of knowing to the functions</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.960" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">performed</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">and the the uh normative</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">standards we use in order to evaluate it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">i think but that you see that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">all the more important the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not its separate kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">means it&#39;s precisely important</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.480" end="00:23:32.400" style="s2">uh i would argue because symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">narrative kind of knowing is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.400" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:37.840" style="s2">we we basically integrate and mediate</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">between the different kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.840" end="00:23:41.279" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s very hard to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">symbolic knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.279" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">without invoking propositional or</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">procedural or perspectival or</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:48.000" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">um because think about it when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">reading a narrative you say where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">participatory narrative well of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">your perspectival but you also get you</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">know you get the mirroring function you</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">get a weird</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">i identity relation forming uh when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">listen to narrative or watch narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:06.080" style="s2">so all of those things have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">play in order for</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.080" end="00:24:09.600" style="s2">uh what mary called the parabola</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">could you just give a descript an</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">explanation of definition of parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">for those who don&#39;t know oh so what mary</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">mary was arguing that uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">that if i when i i&#39;m just all i know is</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:25.440" style="s2">her her version of it uh she described</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:29.200" style="s2">parabolic knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.440" end="00:24:32.240" style="s2">as knowing by sort of means of symbols</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.200" end="00:24:35.360" style="s2">and metaphors um</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.240" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">so um she gave the example of the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.360" end="00:24:39.200" style="s2">way i use</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">family relationships uh to understand</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.200" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">the relationship between cutlery</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">so what we do is we map one system onto</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:50.240" style="s2">another um and and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.440" style="s2">sort of try to say well all knowing is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.240" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">mapping function</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.440" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">and so we can&#39;t make the mapping</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:56.799" style="s2">function itself a kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">because of all knowing makes use of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.799" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">mapping functions that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">category mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">then it was sort of well she said yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:06.159" style="s2">but you&#39;re sort of mapping</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">uh between you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.159" end="00:25:10.720" style="s2">domains in a way that provokes insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">and then again i s you know but insight</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.720" end="00:25:13.679" style="s2">is possible in all kinds of knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to make insight its own</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.679" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">so i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s better to see metaphor and symbol</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:28.159" style="s2">as a narrative as ways that bridge</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.880" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">the kinds of knowing and that therefore</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.880" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">afford</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.760" style="s2">understanding which is to more properly</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">grasp</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.760" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">the relations of relevance between</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.400" style="s2">kinds of knowing when i really</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">understand something i know</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.400" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">i know i don&#39;t just have propositional</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">knowledge and procedural</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:52.960" style="s2">and perspectival and participatory i</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:55.760" style="s2">what i have is i grasp the significance</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.960" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">the relations of relevance between the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.760" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">kinds of knowing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why you can really get to know uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">you know when we when we think we really</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">understand somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">we we don&#39;t know them we don&#39;t have just</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">beliefs about them</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">or even skills about them or even you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">know experience of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.440" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">uh we or even a binding of identity with</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">we we have a sense among how all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:22.240" style="s2">those fit together</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">mutually support each other and so i</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.240" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">metaphor as a profound way of aligning</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">the four kinds of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">to bring about understanding the reason</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:32.960" style="s2">i rely on that distinction is because</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:34.880" style="s2">there&#39;s an increasing distinction</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.960" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">coming out of the philosophy of science</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.880" end="00:26:39.919" style="s2">between distinguishing between</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">between knowledge which is the grasping</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.919" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">of propositions or</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:46.240" style="s2">the having of a skill and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:47.840" style="s2">which is to grasp the significance or</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.240" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">relevance of what you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.840" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">and again you don&#39;t want to reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.320" style="s2">understanding to knowledge because then</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">you won&#39;t be able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.320" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">explain either knowledge or</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">understanding if you just simply equate</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:58.720" style="s2">the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">sorry that was a very long arg a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.720" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">long answer</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">mark um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">i think your intuition that the symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">gives you powerful</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">access the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:16.880" style="s2">from the procedural the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">and the perspective is exactly right but</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.880" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">i think it gives you access precisely</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">because it&#39;s the kind of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">that bridges between it&#39;s right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:24.799" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s not a kind of knowing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.799" end="00:27:28.240" style="s2">what i&#39;m arguing it&#39;s a kind of way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">bridging between the kinds of knowing so</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.240" end="00:27:31.039" style="s2">they could they can more mutually access</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.039" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">when the kinds of knowing or mutually</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">access each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:39.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what we mean by understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">so i i i just want to get a couple sting</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.919" end="00:27:42.080" style="s2">straight so that we&#39;re all on the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:46.320" style="s2">page</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.080" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">so the the way you conceived of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.320" end="00:27:49.520" style="s2">of knowing is is that privileging</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.559" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.520" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">is is that where you&#39;re straight it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.559" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">not privileged</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">nominology as a methodology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:01.039" style="s2">privileging i guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">um do you mean phenomenology as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.039" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">discipline or phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:05.039" style="s2">experience which do you mean by well</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.039" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">phenomenological experience right so</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s graspable from a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">perspective uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:20.240" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s what i i think i</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.240" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">maybe i wasn&#39;t i want to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:26.320" style="s2">i&#39;m not um</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">being obtuse and i stated at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.320" end="00:28:30.320" style="s2">beginning that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">think all kinds of knowing have to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.320" end="00:28:33.600" style="s2">from an internalist perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.080" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">that there&#39;s externalist kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.600" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">knowing especially participatory</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">that was my saying that not all knowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:42.159" style="s2">has to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:43.840" style="s2">directly phenomenologically accessible</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.159" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">to us</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.840" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">as a phenomenological experience per se</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">so and of course there&#39;s there&#39;s senses</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.600" style="s2">in which you don&#39;t directly you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:57.760" style="s2">have a direct phenomenological awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.600" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">of your skills or of the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.760" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s generating the affordances</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">the phenomenological experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">experience actually privile</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">presupposes not privileges supposes</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">all of those processes at work to</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">generate</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">its intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:17.440" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">in the conversation with mary cohen you</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:30.159" style="s2">the the choice of the framework was</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:32.799" style="s2">fairly arbitrary and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.159" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">its justification is by its explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.799" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">power right</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s cleanness its coherence its ability</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.360" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">to match up with the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">these terms are used you know in other</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what i mean by explanatory power</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t just mean sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">ad-hoc pragmatic explanatory power i</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">mean that in a broad</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.360" style="s2">you know in in a more epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">sense but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.360" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">i mean there is there is there is no</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">other way of justifying a taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:09.840" style="s2">as far as i can tell</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:14.320" style="s2">yeah i just i just wanted to uh i i did</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.960" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">leave something out actually it was a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">piece that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">that that andre talked about it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:21.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of pieces right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:23.120" style="s2">um the the one observation that andre in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.840" end="00:30:26.399" style="s2">particular made was that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.120" end="00:30:28.880" style="s2">you know the perspectival capacity</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.399" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">would have to interact with the types of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.880" end="00:30:33.039" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">uh you know bi-directionally right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.039" end="00:30:35.760" style="s2">they&#39;re both informing each other in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">some sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.760" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">and the reason why we think this</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:41.200" style="s2">actually works better and maps better is</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:44.240" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.200" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">if you if you take a hallucinogenic drug</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">like you drop some acid or something</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">and you have what we&#39;re calling the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">profound experience right</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.279" style="s2">but you take nothing back with you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:55.039" style="s2">like well what happened there well the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.279" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">first thing that happened is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.039" end="00:31:01.600" style="s2">you decided you you made a decision to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">to imagine a perspective and then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:05.279" style="s2">decided that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">uh to adopt that perspective and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.279" end="00:31:07.360" style="s2">you decided</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">that you know you were going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.360" end="00:31:13.840" style="s2">participate in that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">perspective actively right and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.840" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">and then you have the the participation</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.840" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">when you unwind all of that what happens</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.840" end="00:31:22.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">you can get all the way to the end and</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.159" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">say yeah whatever happened to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.679" style="s2">is great but i&#39;m not going to take</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:28.720" style="s2">anything back with me right i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.679" end="00:31:30.640" style="s2">going to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.720" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to have that experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.640" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">and like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">not pretend like it didn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">because there are lots of options but</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">one option would be pretend like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:39.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t happen to me</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">and that explains a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.200" end="00:31:42.880" style="s2">psychological phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">having that that extra layer in there</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">and one way that might happen</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">is if you had an experience and one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">your ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">was somehow malfunctioning or damaged it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">would look</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:56.399" style="s2">like your perspectival capacity was</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">damaged</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.399" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">but i would argue that because the</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">perspective has to happen first in order</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">for knowledge to exist in some sense not</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.120" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">facts or experiences or phenomena but</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.120" end="00:32:10.960" style="s2">knowledge because it requires a frame to</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">be discernable</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.960" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">and to be meaningful then it would look</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">perspectival problem when in fact it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">a problem with the knowledge system</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">but what that also means is it gives you</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re using a signaling</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">model and you&#39;re assuming that the four</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">types of knowing are basically just</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:27.919" style="s2">signals</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">and they&#39;re combining somehow right it</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.919" end="00:32:31.679" style="s2">gives you this really powerful model to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">explain why we see the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.679" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">end phenomena with completely different</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">uh source you know sources for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">um and and that was that was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:45.360" style="s2">part of that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">uh decision and then you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.360" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">it with respect to the parabolic you</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:51.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">i still i still prefer this navigational</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.120" end="00:32:54.840" style="s2">model that we don&#39;t have otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:56.559" style="s2">you know just because you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.840" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">perspective what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.559" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">navigational you mean navigating through</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">participatory knowing navigating through</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">the world navigating through</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:04.320" style="s2">participatory knowing and through the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.320" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">right because again you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:10.640" style="s2">procedural that can navigate</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">for you the propositions but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.640" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">procedural can&#39;t navigate</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:17.039" style="s2">your participation because your</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:18.480" style="s2">participation is in some clear sense</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.039" end="00:33:19.760" style="s2">continuous</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.480" end="00:33:21.760" style="s2">right and so there&#39;s this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.760" end="00:33:22.399" style="s2">continuous and discrete sampling on top</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.760" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.399" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">and the reason why that&#39;s important is</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.679" style="s2">because you you know like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">on a bike you&#39;re constantly balancing</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.679" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not clear to me how you</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:35.519" style="s2">would know to balance and how you would</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.519" end="00:33:38.640" style="s2">as you&#39;re going through the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:41.679" style="s2">actively that you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.640" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">in terms of procedures</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.679" end="00:33:44.080" style="s2">what that</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">so there mark you have far more options</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">okay so let me try and address a couple</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">things um</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:34:00.480" style="s2">one is i i</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:03.679" style="s2">i was always clear that i got the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.480" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">and i thought i i was i was indicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.679" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">of course all the all the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:08.320" style="s2">knowing can have causal impact on each</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.320" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">um that um</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">if i was trying maybe i was</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">maybe when i was talking about causal</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">dependence</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">that was being understood as indicating</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s only a one-way</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:26.639" style="s2">causal interaction um what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.200" end="00:34:28.639" style="s2">supposed to show as an ontological</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.639" end="00:34:29.440" style="s2">dependence it&#39;s it&#39;s that there can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.639" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.440" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">you you could have just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">participatory knowing on its own which</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:41.280" style="s2">i i think that&#39;s what microbes have</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:43.599" style="s2">um right and you and then you might get</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.280" end="00:34:44.720" style="s2">a beginning of sense making as you get a</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.599" end="00:34:46.399" style="s2">little bit higher</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.720" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">um and then you when you get a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.399" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">for learning you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:49.679" style="s2">procedural</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">and only when you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.679" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">language are you going to get</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:35:01.359" style="s2">so the ontological dependence means</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">like what is which which ones perceive</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.359" end="00:35:05.280" style="s2">which ones presuppose the other for</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">their existence</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.280" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">but that is not to say that they are are</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">causally independent from each other</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">of course and that&#39;s what i meant by</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:14.800" style="s2">intervention i think uh perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">knowing is one of the most powerful ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.800" end="00:35:21.280" style="s2">you can intervene</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:23.200" style="s2">on on your participatory knowing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.280" end="00:35:25.760" style="s2">what in fact happens</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.200" end="00:35:26.560" style="s2">when you get things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.760" end="00:35:28.800" style="s2">loneliness</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.560" end="00:35:29.920" style="s2">or you get culture shock because your</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.800" end="00:35:32.160" style="s2">salience landscaping</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.920" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t working and that sends error</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.160" end="00:35:34.880" style="s2">signal</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">i think to your participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">and it starts to uh self-organize</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.680" end="00:35:43.920" style="s2">again language of training is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.240" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">language of causal interaction the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.920" end="00:35:47.520" style="s2">language of explaining is the language</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">of ontological dependence</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.520" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">right uh so my being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">dependent on my being alive i can be</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">alive without being able to see</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">but my being able to see causality</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:03.520" style="s2">interacts with me being alive because</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">seeing allows me to get food and eat</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.520" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between things</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">being able to causally interact</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">and then being causally dependent one is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">trying to get sort of the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.119" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:14.800" style="s2">that&#39;s causal dependence you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.119" end="00:36:16.560" style="s2">to train of course you&#39;re trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.800" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">well how can they impact and intervene</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.560" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">on each other</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:24.640" style="s2">so i i never meant to exclude</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.480" style="s2">a bi-directionality of causal</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.640" end="00:36:28.640" style="s2">interaction between the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.480" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">in fact i think the kinds of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.640" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">impact and constrain each other all over</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:34.640" style="s2">the place</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t the point of of the taxonomy</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.640" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">as i&#39;ve been trying to sort of say i</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:41.359" style="s2">think the point of the taxonomy is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:43.440" style="s2">explain and the point of explanation is</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.359" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">to reveal ontological structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.440" end="00:36:46.480" style="s2">and ontological structure works in terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">of causal dependence</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.480" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">primarily now the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">point about the parabolic i i get what</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:57.520" style="s2">about how we navigate and and i thought</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">i was agreeing with that let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.520" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">what how why i thought that i think the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:03.599" style="s2">primary</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">way in which we you&#39;ll allow me to</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.599" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">navigate uh participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">navigate the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:15.359" style="s2">the agent arena relationship is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:16.320" style="s2">process of aspiration and the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.359" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">can ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.320" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">lead to reciprocal opening etc etc then</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:25.040" style="s2">i do think that the act of aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i try to argue</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.040" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">depends on narrative&#39;s ability to open</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">the temporal skills</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">i mean what narrative allows me to do is</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">take my current self</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">identify with my future self and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">identity is non-logical</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s what i need for aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:45.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s inherently symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">so i do think that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.359" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">symbolism are the primary tools we use</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">for aspiration and i think aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">is the process by which we navigate</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">by which we restructure the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">i&#39;ve been spending a lot of time on this</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:07.119" style="s2">uh notion of aspiration and i do think</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">parabolic uh thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.119" end="00:38:10.240" style="s2">in mary&#39;s sense narrative symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:13.359" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.240" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">is necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.359" end="00:38:17.200" style="s2">um aspiration i do think ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">knowing that&#39;s involved right the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">you know yourself by identifying with</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">yourself it&#39;s ultimately a form of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:27.760" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s answering your</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.760" end="00:38:33.359" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">but i i i&#39;m glad you asked it because</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.359" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">never meant to convey that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">ontological relationships of dependents</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:41.920" style="s2">were some uh were meant to be some kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.520" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.920" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">unidirectional line of causal</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">so that&#39;s why i gave you the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.520" style="s2">sight and being alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">sight depends on being alive being alive</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.520" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t depend on sight</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:56.480" style="s2">but seeing and being alive of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:01.200" style="s2">causally interact</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.480" end="00:39:04.960" style="s2">and affect each other um and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.200" end="00:39:07.760" style="s2">so i i i i i think i i guess</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.960" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s my fault to some degree i i</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.760" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">i haven&#39;t taken the time to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">really clarify like pulling out the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:17.440" style="s2">language of explaining the language of</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">explaining distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.440" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">the causal interaction that is really</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.599" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">um there is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.599" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">but again i didn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">i&#39;m frustrated with myself because i it</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">was so i i</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">you&#39;re right i have never explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">argued that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">i i said that aspiration is how we we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:46.480" style="s2">uh transformed the agent in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">relationship but i&#39;ve never directly</p>

<p begin="00:39:52.400" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">um and it and and for and i agree with</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.160" end="00:40:00.640" style="s2">mary i think that&#39;s inherently narrative</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:01.599" style="s2">um and inherently symbolic it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.640" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">because we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.599" end="00:40:05.599" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to a participatory knowing</p>

<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">based on non-logical identity and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">symbolic in nature</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.400" end="00:40:18.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m disagreeing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.079" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">mary i just i like i said</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.480" end="00:40:21.440" style="s2">again it depends</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:24.880" style="s2">depends what you want what would you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:28.560" style="s2">gain by</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.880" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">adding that as a new kind of knowing um</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.560" end="00:40:31.920" style="s2">what would be what would be what would</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:34.000" style="s2">be like what in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.920" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">what aspect like does it have its own</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.000" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">particular phenomenological normativity</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">what does what does what does parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">knowing result in i know what</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:46.240" style="s2">propositional procedural perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">and participatory result in and i know</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.240" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">what their respective</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">senses of normativity are i i can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">that for</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:55.680" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know how to fit parabolic</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:57.200" style="s2">knowing into the taxonomy because it</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.680" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i can&#39;t give answers to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.200" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">by which the taxonomy was produced</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">right yeah no i i i was uh explaining uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.839" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">perspectival with</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">with respect to the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">interacts with the types of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">in in and i&#39;ll argue in a unique way uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:18.160" style="s2">specifically because you called that out</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:19.920" style="s2">and said oh you can you know damage this</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.160" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">and it looks like they&#39;re perspectively</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.920" end="00:41:22.240" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:24.480" style="s2">but i would argue that that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.240" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">you damaged you damaged the type of</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.480" end="00:41:28.240" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">and or or they lost access to a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.240" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">of knowledge that they had</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">and that constrains the the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">and i can see why it would look the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:37.359" style="s2">other way around</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.359" style="s2">um and and there would be no way to tell</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.359" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">right that&#39;s part of the downside</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.359" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">and then i would say you know that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">parabolic is all about</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:46.319" style="s2">how you understand the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:47.920" style="s2">between objects</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.319" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what you get out of it to mary&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.920" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">point this whole idea about</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">uh about square and circle and how they</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:56.880" style="s2">represent</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">you know male and female and and all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.880" end="00:42:00.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">is the way we understand narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.079" end="00:42:05.119" style="s2">but those are multi-affordable</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">ways of navigating your participation</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">with the world</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">is is something like what i&#39;m what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">arguing there and because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">getting rid of the perspectival i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">making it primary</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:18.240" style="s2">uh you know nothing much is changing</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">we&#39;re just adding a bunch of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.240" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">looks like it might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">useful and um i&#39;m part of the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">through a paper</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:28.079" style="s2">and then manuel&#39;s added a bunch of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">uh that we&#39;re gonna put in and so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.079" end="00:42:31.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll get you a paper and maybe that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">help clear up what we&#39;re thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.920" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">how well but but also i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">you guys are free to do what you want i</p>

<p begin="00:42:38.240" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">questions i mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:44.640" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not claiming authority over</p>

<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:53.839" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">with you that that&#39;s that&#39;s what this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.839" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">about um</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">so i hope i didn&#39;t convey anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">inappropriate here that&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:02.640" style="s2">not at all okay no i just wanted to make</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">it clear that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.640" end="00:43:06.720" style="s2">we can explain this better and written</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">so that you&#39;ll have more time to chew on</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.720" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">it and we&#39;re in the process of doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:11.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">and we&#39;re happy to do it okay well</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">um and perhaps what we&#39;ve accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:20.800" style="s2">is i i&#39;ve tried to i&#39;ve tried to be very</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">clear</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.800" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">about you know the principles behind my</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.839" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">methodology and the justification</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">and and the distinctions that i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">uh prevent certain kinds of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:33.440" style="s2">um and so</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.520" end="00:44:10.480" style="s2">substantially in a theoretical sense but</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.480" end="00:44:17.680" style="s2">uh i i i see that there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of holes in my work that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.680" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">have been revealed in this discussion um</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.280" end="00:44:24.960" style="s2">i i feel responsible for now and</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">responsible too</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:38.560" style="s2">scientist in the hat of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">sort of trying to help people train</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.560" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">skills and interventions and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to manage between those uh</p>

<p begin="00:44:47.520" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">under the impression that we resolved</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:54.720" style="s2">those holes for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">so yeah right maybe</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.520" end="00:46:10.560" style="s2">integration right in motion but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.640" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">really fascinating because i</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.560" end="00:46:13.920" style="s2">i actually think of it um like if i step</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">outside of the human framing for a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.920" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">moment and i look at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening on the globe</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:20.240" style="s2">is it like a giant cybernetic organism</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:23.040" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.240" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">each organism is in fact a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.040" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s some element of searching</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">the you know whatever the design space</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:33.440" style="s2">is for survival</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:34.720" style="s2">and that you can yeah like unpack the uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.440" end="00:46:37.839" style="s2">the genetic expression</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.720" end="00:46:39.280" style="s2">and like fully express that proposition</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.839" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.280" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">um yeah so that&#39;s kind of how i see it</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.480" style="s2">as like as</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.280" style="s2">maybe at the flipping the stack there</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.480" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">but that&#39;s interesting i mean that goes</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.280" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">towards the</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">the this idea again about um</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot but the that goes towards</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s a logos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">well this is what i would say uh tyler</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:04.160" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.520" end="00:47:05.200" style="s2">the notion of logos as intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.160" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">that there&#39;s a logos that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.200" end="00:47:07.920" style="s2">non-propositional but it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:09.839" style="s2">properly logos</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.920" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">um so a greek way of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.839" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">something like the genetic code of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:16.800" style="s2">course is it&#39;s not a proposition</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:17.680" style="s2">um but it is it is it is some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.800" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.680" end="00:47:23.440" style="s2">um that um organizes and constrains</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.440" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">in a reliable and discriminate</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:32.400" style="s2">and in discriminating fashion</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:35.839" style="s2">of course we have to be careful when we</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.400" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">talk about dna as a code</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.839" end="00:47:40.240" style="s2">because it&#39;s originally meant as a</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:41.599" style="s2">metaphor and we can get caught up in it</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.240" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">a little too much</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.599" end="00:47:45.920" style="s2">um oh sure well i mean there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">other additional layer on top though</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.920" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">additional genetic code itself of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.680" style="s2">triplicate</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:54.960" style="s2">expression that that that in itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.680" end="00:47:58.240" style="s2">totally totally</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.960" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">and so i think i think the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.240" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:03.280" style="s2">about logos because logos</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:04.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i like it as a term</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.280" end="00:48:07.760" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.880" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">intelligibility because logos to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.760" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">and this sort of a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">heideggerian reading</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:15.760" style="s2">right logos to my mind points to that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">stacking</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.760" end="00:48:20.559" style="s2">uh that i was talking about because you</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">know it means speech but it also means</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.559" end="00:48:23.040" style="s2">gathering things together so they belong</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.040" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">and it also means a sense of that and</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">then it also</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">ultimately uh means some deeper pattern</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">or real pattern in the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">that affords all of that happening all</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s just like the proper pushing</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">of that information through the stack</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s yeah and then that</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">constant self-expression and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:45.760" style="s2">self-testing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">reintegration with the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.760" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">environment at least in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">um my my question from last time and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">that just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:48:58.960" style="s2">came in at the end and missed it but um</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">it has to do with the expression of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.960" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">in these spaces yeah it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">the crux of a lot of this meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:08.559" style="s2">who has a lack of general capacity</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">which is kind of foundational to life</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.559" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">right life is</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">generative so yes i&#39;m wondering in</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:18.000" style="s2">like so i even switched my name as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.800" style="s2">kind of uh nod to it but</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.000" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">i i&#39;m wondering in the hypostasis like</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.800" end="00:49:24.240" style="s2">in the expression of the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:25.680" style="s2">nature and how we conceive of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.240" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">in the father the son and the holy</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.680" end="00:49:28.800" style="s2">spirit where is</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">how is it that we&#39;re receiving the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.800" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">divine feminine is that expressing</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:34.160" style="s2">itself and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.839" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">where where is it is it hiding like is</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.160" end="00:49:37.680" style="s2">is that in fact the kind of inverted</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:39.119" style="s2">weird nature of it that it is always</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.680" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">hidden and you have to go searching for</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.119" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">yeah yeah sorry can you comment on that</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">perhaps well first of all i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:49.760" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:52.559" style="s2">oh and you know i&#39;ve met with the board</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">of the verveiki foundation and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.559" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">i i have had it</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.359" style="s2">as a policy pre-existing all of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.359" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">i have tried to encourage</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:07.760" style="s2">that the feminine voice and one of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:09.520" style="s2">things i wanted is</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.760" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">not to equate the feminine with just</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.520" end="00:50:13.280" style="s2">women or the masculine with just men</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">but i did i i want more women</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.280" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">participating in all of this for exactly</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:18.160" style="s2">the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:19.359" style="s2">that you articulate i think i mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.160" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">evidence is i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.359" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">mounting that we work better in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.280" style="s2">distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:26.160" style="s2">and i i would i would predict that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.280" end="00:50:29.040" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.160" end="00:50:30.000" style="s2">that we work better uh when we have you</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.040" end="00:50:33.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.000" end="00:50:34.160" style="s2">some distribution i don&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:35.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.160" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">but that might be an empirical question</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.760" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">and not just a moral question</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:41.440" style="s2">you know what what did distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.440" end="00:50:45.760" style="s2">and masculine i i i prefer yin and yang</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t get so politically</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.760" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">laden but anyway within</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">um distributed cognition i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">that&#39;s very right i think our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.319" style="s2">overly yang</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">i was talking with jp morseau about this</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.319" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be released on voices with</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">raviki and how</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">um christianity got especially talked</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.800" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">the idea that it got very to something</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">we got very locked down in top down</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">emanation</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:14.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s lost um the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">emergence from the so-called material</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.640" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting is a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">thinkers that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:26.640" style="s2">jp and i were talking about um</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:28.880" style="s2">scottish aerogena but even there&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.640" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">aspects of this in aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.880" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">you can see them as trying to get more</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:36.960" style="s2">of a balance but especially aerogena</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">between the top down emanation</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.960" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">and the the bottom-up emergence</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:44.400" style="s2">and and what was interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">regina did this work on</p>

<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:50.960" style="s2">really integrates in the dialect fashion</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.960" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">generativity of emergence and then the</p>

<p begin="00:51:57.520" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">and i think that that&#39;s the right way to</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">dialectical thinkers not dialectic just</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">in their manner but</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">that they they ultimately saw the</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">i think that and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">there&#39;s more and more this is what jp</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">was claiming there&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:23.839" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">christian thinkers who are turning that</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.839" end="00:52:30.160" style="s2">way i think this is all a way</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">of trying to make space and a proper</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.160" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">for the feminine within</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.720" end="00:52:40.960" style="s2">our ontology that goes much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">and i think is therefore in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.960" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">more important than all the political</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:47.839" style="s2">discourse around that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.720" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">yeah i can say i i i think i agree</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:56.559" style="s2">very much so with that uh i appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">it john thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.559" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">thank you and so by the way tyler</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:04.240" style="s2">that sort of goes to the previous</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.240" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">like that&#39;s why you sometimes you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">you can sometimes hear it in my voice i</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">do i do want to respond because</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">you know because i have these arguments</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">and ideas because they bring clarity</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very sort of top-down</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:20.559" style="s2">selective thing but i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">strangle</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.559" end="00:53:25.599" style="s2">if you if i don&#39;t i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">strangle the bottom-up emergence</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.599" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s happening in the discord server</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:30.800" style="s2">right and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">i i that&#39;s what i meant about i find it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.800" end="00:53:36.400" style="s2">tricky to wear these two hats</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:41.280" style="s2">and and moderate between them so</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.400" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">i i i&#39;m asking for people&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.280" end="00:53:44.800" style="s2">patience and good faith because i i want</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">to keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.800" end="00:53:48.720" style="s2">uh i want to keep in deep dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">the community and</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.720" end="00:53:55.040" style="s2">and i want to i i want to help</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">election and clarification but i really</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.040" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want to strangle</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">that generativity that that bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">emergence</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:05.200" style="s2">because um it&#39;s gonna it&#39;s gonna uncover</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">and realize things that i could not</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.200" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">possibly do</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:10.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna shape things that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.160" style="s2">more relevant to responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.960" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.160" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">that i could not do as any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:18.880" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">so you said was actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.880" end="00:54:22.720" style="s2">running through what was going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.440" style="s2">previous discussion at least as sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.720" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.440" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">a sense of attitude of orientation in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.040" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">in my thinking yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s one thing that i&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">of been drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:39.040" style="s2">uh because i believe it is important and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:40.799" style="s2">anyone that is expressing that or</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.040" end="00:54:43.280" style="s2">who is expressing the importance of it i</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.799" end="00:54:46.079" style="s2">think their signal should be boosted</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.280" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">and that this is um it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.079" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">seems to be expressed at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">sociological level right and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">and uh and the individuals certainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:57.599" style="s2">here have been reported anecdotally so</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s something deeply um</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.599" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">incongruous right now between the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">expression of the masculine and the</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:06.240" style="s2">feminine the yin and the yang</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">and i i&#39;m i&#39;m all for uh getting that</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">thing to swirl back into unity</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.559" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">right oh well yeah i think you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:19.920" style="s2">in deep agreement about this um</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:22.160" style="s2">so i mean it&#39;s a tricky thing because</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.920" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re plugging into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.160" end="00:55:26.240" style="s2">perennial problem of trying to move</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:28.000" style="s2">between plasticity and stability</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.240" end="00:55:29.680" style="s2">much plasticity and the system breaks</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.000" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">down too much stability</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.680" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">and the system becomes fragile and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">breaks um</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">and so trying to to constantly adjust</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">that sweet spot</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">is is very very challenging oh it is</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:44.160" style="s2">huge</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:46.559" style="s2">there but there&#39;s okay but it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.160" end="00:55:48.799" style="s2">there could be an attractor of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.559" end="00:55:50.000" style="s2">that&#39;s uniquely it&#39;s like it&#39;s the third</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.799" end="00:55:51.680" style="s2">element right</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.000" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s triplicate form because we</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.680" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">get stuck in this binary sense of</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:57.680" style="s2">masculine</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">feminine too but we have to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.680" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:03.599" style="s2">and the transformative is only possible</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">with the triplicate structure so</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.599" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">we we have to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">i i don&#39;t know there&#39;s something deeper</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">even than that and that has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">the participatory for sure</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.680" style="s2">like right now right like what what</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">people engage in and truly appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.680" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">with what it is to interact in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">sense and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:23.119" style="s2">there&#39;s something missing in our current</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">environment and in our current</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.119" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">conversational space that represents</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">an equal attractor for both the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">masculine and feminine and we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:32.240" style="s2">close i</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">i i i touch on it every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.240" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">let&#39;s say but</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a whole constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">topics it&#39;s more like an orchestration</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">of conversations than one</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:42.000" style="s2">right yeah there&#39;s something going on</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.000" end="00:56:46.480" style="s2">i i think there are many of these uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">i think there&#39;s the mask and then the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.480" end="00:56:51.920" style="s2">feminine or the yin and yang</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">like i said i think there is finding</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">like i said which is tricky finding this</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:59.839" style="s2">sweet spot that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:01.280" style="s2">you know allows flow without fusion or</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.839" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">confusion between</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.280" end="00:57:04.559" style="s2">languages of training and languages of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">explaining and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.559" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">uh and and also getting something also</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">individuation and participation there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">all of these</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">sort of you know binaries um</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.520" end="00:57:21.839" style="s2">that we are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">you allow me the metaphor we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.839" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">to i see myself at least and</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:28.480" style="s2">most people are interested in my work i</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">i see myself as trying to set them into</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.480" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">motion again</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:37.359" style="s2">to get them dynamically dialectic again</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.079" end="00:57:39.760" style="s2">and so that as you as you call it</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.359" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">and you know chris knight also called</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.760" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">that artwork</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">that that third factor um the logo</p>
