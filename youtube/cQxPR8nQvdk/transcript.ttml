<p begin="00:00:49.760" end="00:00:55.790" style="s2">and I had a conversation about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.570" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">conspiracy theories being a journalist</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.790" end="00:01:00.170" style="s2">in this culture war or liminal war space</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:01.820" style="s2">and this is an ongoing conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.170" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">him and I have been having for a while</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.820" end="00:01:06.680" style="s2">now and we did this spontaneous jam</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:08.659" style="s2">session last week</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.680" end="00:01:10.970" style="s2">got some good feedback on the rebel</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.659" end="00:01:12.409" style="s2">wisdom Channel and the idea today was to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.970" end="00:01:14.930" style="s2">have sort of a continuation at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.409" end="00:01:18.320" style="s2">conversation not just with him and I but</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.930" end="00:01:20.440" style="s2">the other people out the ZOA the tribe</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.320" end="00:01:23.390" style="s2">about the stove oh that&#39;s for me so</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.440" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen today is me and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.390" end="00:01:27.410" style="s2">David are gonna have a little exchange</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:29.390" style="s2">and if you have questions that come</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.410" end="00:01:34.550" style="s2">alive for you write them in the chat box</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.390" end="00:01:36.140" style="s2">and when we pivot to the Q&amp;A portion I</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.550" end="00:01:37.909" style="s2">will take you in and then you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.140" end="00:01:39.560" style="s2">of reach your question to David and we</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.909" end="00:01:41.110" style="s2">can have a kind of a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.560" end="00:01:44.630" style="s2">the clock of intelligence that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.110" end="00:01:50.170" style="s2">so that being said David how you doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.630" end="00:01:54.170" style="s2">today all right good yeah yeah I&#39;m good</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.170" end="00:01:57.170" style="s2">it&#39;s good so I was thinking because not</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.170" end="00:01:59.210" style="s2">everyone might have watched the video</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.170" end="00:02:02.659" style="s2">where we had that kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.210" end="00:02:04.520" style="s2">and that but the general theme is kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.659" end="00:02:07.820" style="s2">of the complexities about doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.520" end="00:02:10.970" style="s2">journalism in this liminal state or this</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.820" end="00:02:12.620" style="s2">liminal war and I wonder if you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.970" end="00:02:17.450" style="s2">share your thoughts on that in the broad</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.620" end="00:02:19.530" style="s2">broad way hmm I guess it&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.450" end="00:02:21.860" style="s2">journalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.530" end="00:02:24.450" style="s2">is a kind of loaded term I think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.860" end="00:02:28.920" style="s2">prefer framing it is like how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.450" end="00:02:31.470" style="s2">truth and that sort of problem of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.920" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">finding truth feels very pressing at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.470" end="00:02:38.760" style="s2">moment in the kind of overload of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.440" end="00:02:40.320" style="s2">information and I sketched out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.760" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">in our conversation and also in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.320" end="00:02:46.140" style="s2">conversation when the films that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:49.560" style="s2">done recently about I looked</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.140" end="00:02:53.160" style="s2">specifically at one story of London real</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.560" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">and David Icke and that that film being</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.160" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">banned by YouTube and all of the issues</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">around that that that brought up like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">huge issues and I sense that like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:09.720" style="s2">kind of the meta framing for me feels</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">like we&#39;re in this interregnum space I</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.720" end="00:03:16.280" style="s2">think Zac Stein has called it the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">what&#39;s the world between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.280" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">education and a time between worlds I</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:21.989" style="s2">think that was his book so there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">of time between worlds where you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.989" end="00:03:28.170" style="s2">kind of imagine a Mike background I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:30.269" style="s2">I worked for channel 4 news in the BBC</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.170" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">and I&#39;ve made documentaries for for both</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.269" end="00:03:34.590" style="s2">of them so I&#39;ve been in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:38.160" style="s2">newsrooms and part of the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.590" end="00:03:42.269" style="s2">traditional media machine for almost two</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.160" end="00:03:45.150" style="s2">decades and then created rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.269" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">initially with a couple of films with</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:51.510" style="s2">Jordan Pederson and then a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">exploration into a lot of the same areas</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.510" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">that I know Peter you&#39;ve covered on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">intellectual explorers podcast and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:02.610" style="s2">just following the thread of what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:07.829" style="s2">this emergent conversation and so kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.610" end="00:04:10.890" style="s2">of being very aware of both the like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.829" end="00:04:12.269" style="s2">the benefits of the alternative media</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.890" end="00:04:14.010" style="s2">like covering stories that I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.269" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">easily able to cover in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.010" end="00:04:19.320" style="s2">and being sort of free to put out</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">everything that I wanted and not having</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.320" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">a whole load of editors that I had to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:26.940" style="s2">kind of keep happy and all of those kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">of really beneficial sides of being</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.940" end="00:04:33.210" style="s2">outside the Machine but then at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:35.490" style="s2">time feeling that we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.210" end="00:04:37.560" style="s2">and then using kind of Jordan halls</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.490" end="00:04:39.479" style="s2">model of kind of the blue church the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.560" end="00:04:43.169" style="s2">sort of blue church enterprise which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.479" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">very broadcast very a lot of our way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.169" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">understanding the world in up until</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.300" end="00:04:51.419" style="s2">quite recently was that we we put a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:52.979" style="s2">of the as sense-making capacity on to</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.419" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">that structure whether we realized it or</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.979" end="00:04:58.440" style="s2">not on to academia on to the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:02.789" style="s2">media onto this very broadcast way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.440" end="00:05:04.139" style="s2">making sense of the world and the and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.789" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">now we&#39;re in this very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.139" end="00:05:10.530" style="s2">decentralized much more decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:12.449" style="s2">modality this much more digital modality</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">that has undermined a lot of that blue</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.449" end="00:05:17.370" style="s2">church structure and for good reasons a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:19.889" style="s2">lot of that structure have become quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.370" end="00:05:23.550" style="s2">Hollow quite corrupt and a lot of it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.889" end="00:05:24.930" style="s2">a kind of like the Kathy Newman Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.550" end="00:05:26.180" style="s2">Peterson interview I think is a really</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.930" end="00:05:29.250" style="s2">good example of that it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.180" end="00:05:30.889" style="s2">performative rather than actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.250" end="00:05:34.139" style="s2">to get to truth it became like a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.889" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">performative impression of truth seeking</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.139" end="00:05:38.520" style="s2">and I think a lot of journalism had got</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:40.110" style="s2">that way so I think like I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.520" end="00:05:41.759" style="s2">trying to hold this place of not trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.110" end="00:05:45.360" style="s2">to defend the old structure because</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.759" end="00:05:47.639" style="s2">people especially on YouTube a very anti</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.360" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">mainstream it leans very anti mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.639" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">so it&#39;s right but it&#39;s trying to hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:58.050" style="s2">some of the values of that structure</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:06:00.599" style="s2">which at its best had fact-checking</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.050" end="00:06:02.599" style="s2">had some principles of trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.599" end="00:06:05.849" style="s2">both sides of the story before</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.599" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">publishing something which had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.849" end="00:06:10.469" style="s2">an evolved set of practices that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:13.560" style="s2">see happening at all in there in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.469" end="00:06:15.150" style="s2">alternative media and that really if</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.560" end="00:06:17.849" style="s2">we&#39;re in this kind of interregnum</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.150" end="00:06:20.090" style="s2">between the decline of that old true</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.849" end="00:06:23.820" style="s2">seeking mechanism with all of its faults</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.090" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">we&#39;re not we don&#39;t have and you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.820" end="00:06:27.570" style="s2">of imagine there might be a place on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:29.930" style="s2">other side of that where we have some</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.570" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">kind of decentralized reliable</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.930" end="00:06:35.400" style="s2">democratic way of finding truth we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.270" end="00:06:37.110" style="s2">not there yet I don&#39;t really know what</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.400" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">that might look like it seems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.110" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">in this kind of very we&#39;re in the valley</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.820" style="s2">between two potential kind of solutions</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:46.449" style="s2">to the problem of truth and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.820" end="00:06:49.090" style="s2">avoid</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.449" end="00:06:50.789" style="s2">we none of us have the capacity to find</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.090" end="00:06:54.370" style="s2">out absolutely everything for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.789" end="00:06:56.589" style="s2">no matter how much we like to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.370" end="00:06:59.199" style="s2">think that we do we don&#39;t we always</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.589" end="00:07:03.009" style="s2">proxy our sense making to someone or</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.199" end="00:07:06.370" style="s2">something to some degree and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.009" end="00:07:08.710" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing that how do we how do</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.370" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">we find the signal from the noise in</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.710" end="00:07:17.589" style="s2">this heavily kind of weaponized and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:20.469" style="s2">information saturated and complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.589" end="00:07:22.300" style="s2">environment and I kind of I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.469" end="00:07:23.589" style="s2">how many people here perhaps how many</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.300" end="00:07:24.819" style="s2">people here have seen the war on sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.589" end="00:07:30.430" style="s2">making the film with daniel trachtenberg</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.819" end="00:07:32.589" style="s2">oh great there&#39;s a quite a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.430" end="00:07:34.180" style="s2">I think he lays it out like lays out the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.589" end="00:07:38.889" style="s2">territory about as well as anyone I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.180" end="00:07:41.469" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.889" end="00:07:42.939" style="s2">that&#39;s the inquiry and I think as we</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.469" end="00:07:47.800" style="s2">discussed in our film the other day</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.939" end="00:07:49.719" style="s2">Peter I anyone he&#39;s coming at this with</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.800" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">an air of certainty that they think they</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.719" end="00:07:57.189" style="s2">know what the answer is whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:59.169" style="s2">kind of free speech absolutism or like</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.189" end="00:08:01.449" style="s2">any ideological perspective is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.169" end="00:08:02.770" style="s2">equipped I think we could drill down</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.449" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">into that like for me free speech</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.770" end="00:08:06.669" style="s2">absolutism doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:09.099" style="s2">sustainable in a world of finite</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.669" end="00:08:11.020" style="s2">attention that has like I believe there</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.099" end="00:08:13.240" style="s2">has to be some kind of curation which I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.020" end="00:08:15.339" style="s2">know gets a lot of people don&#39;t like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.240" end="00:08:17.110" style="s2">hear on YouTube especially like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.339" end="00:08:19.060" style="s2">think the the marketplace of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.110" end="00:08:20.499" style="s2">marketplace of ideas right now is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.060" end="00:08:23.979" style="s2">functioning well for many different</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.499" end="00:08:25.419" style="s2">reasons there&#39;s a whole load of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.979" end="00:08:28.839" style="s2">branching off points we can go into on</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.419" end="00:08:32.380" style="s2">there so yeah yes so something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.839" end="00:08:35.069" style="s2">alive right now is Steven Lucas&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.380" end="00:08:37.870" style="s2">phases of power is coming to mind and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.069" end="00:08:39.729" style="s2">how he understands power is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.870" end="00:08:40.930" style="s2">like decision-making power that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.729" end="00:08:42.310" style="s2">lowest level then there&#39;s non</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.930" end="00:08:44.260" style="s2">decision-making power and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.310" end="00:08:46.120" style="s2">ideological power so another way to look</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.260" end="00:08:47.889" style="s2">at it is like decision-making power is</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.120" end="00:08:50.110" style="s2">just like the content the propositions</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.889" end="00:08:52.839" style="s2">being exchanged like the obvious stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.110" end="00:08:54.699" style="s2">and then non decision-making power is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.839" end="00:08:56.649" style="s2">the agenda whoever gets to set the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.699" end="00:08:58.390" style="s2">agenda gets the influence the decisions</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.649" end="00:09:00.220" style="s2">gets the influence of propositions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.390" end="00:09:02.260" style="s2">then you can look at the the second</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.220" end="00:09:04.780" style="s2">is the frame kind of the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.260" end="00:09:06.850" style="s2">frame that a conversation is agreeing to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.780" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">and then the last ones ideology</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.850" end="00:09:11.830" style="s2">obviously like who controls the ideology</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:13.090" style="s2">and I think that Kathy Newman interview</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.830" end="00:09:15.850" style="s2">with Peterson was like a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.090" end="00:09:18.910" style="s2">display of how those three things got</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.850" end="00:09:20.230" style="s2">exposed because you know Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.910" end="00:09:22.810" style="s2">thought like oh this guy&#39;s gonna buy</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.230" end="00:09:24.160" style="s2">into my agenda finding my frame that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.810" end="00:09:25.720" style="s2">not gonna happen and you just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.160" end="00:09:29.560" style="s2">like called it out in a way without</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.720" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">calling it out so and then I think I</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.560" end="00:09:33.490" style="s2">just wanted to like I have a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">question with that but with the blue</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.490" end="00:09:38.290" style="s2">church in the machine what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.460" end="00:09:39.460" style="s2">those things are that agenda that frame</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.290" end="00:09:45.370" style="s2">of the ideology that&#39;s currently</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.460" end="00:09:47.380" style="s2">influencing it and that&#39;s let&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.370" end="00:09:50.980" style="s2">put a flag in the fact that even the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.380" end="00:09:54.250" style="s2">blue church frame is a is a useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.980" end="00:09:56.110" style="s2">approximation it&#39;s not I think any of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.250" end="00:09:58.270" style="s2">these ways that we can talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.110" end="00:10:03.220" style="s2">they&#39;re useful up to a point but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.270" end="00:10:04.870" style="s2">also obscure some stuff as well I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.220" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">like the blue church find a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.870" end="00:10:12.910" style="s2">useful frame to use but I also and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">think I&#39;ve also kind of become really</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.910" end="00:10:17.230" style="s2">aware of the limitations of seeing it in</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">that way as well because I feel I feel</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.230" end="00:10:21.850" style="s2">it can be too optimistic about oh well</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:23.410" style="s2">the blue church is collapsing and we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.850" end="00:10:27.970" style="s2">just transition to something new I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.410" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">I think that&#39;s kind of naive and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.970" end="00:10:30.430" style="s2">if you really kind of think about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:32.400" style="s2">that means it&#39;s a pretty terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.430" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">prospect</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.400" end="00:10:36.340" style="s2">but I mean for me the frame like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:37.780" style="s2">interesting thing for me that the focus</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.340" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">about rebel wisdom from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.780" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">was the frame that I was most aware of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:48.730" style="s2">was the the limiting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:50.980" style="s2">materialistic secular frame that I was</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.730" end="00:10:52.750" style="s2">really familiar with from the from kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.980" end="00:10:55.300" style="s2">of working in traditional media and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.750" end="00:10:57.100" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was so initially taken with</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.300" end="00:10:59.650" style="s2">Jordan Peterson was because this was a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.100" end="00:11:03.190" style="s2">guy who was challenging the New Atheists</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.650" end="00:11:05.620" style="s2">on their own turf and he wasn&#39;t easily</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.190" end="00:11:08.830" style="s2">dismissed as being pseudo-scientific or</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.620" end="00:11:10.660" style="s2">as being new agey or being any of any of</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.830" end="00:11:13.560" style="s2">the ways that normally that frame is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.660" end="00:11:15.420" style="s2">defended and I knew how</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.560" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">like that kind of Richard Dawkins Sam</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.420" end="00:11:20.490" style="s2">Harris frame was extremely powerful in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:22.470" style="s2">the media and as someone who&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.490" end="00:11:23.910" style="s2">been interested in spirituality and been</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.470" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">interested in transformation and all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.910" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">these subjects and just really aware</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.980" end="00:11:30.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s just not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:32.220" style="s2">mainstream conversation I was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.000" end="00:11:34.890" style="s2">very aware of where that&#39;s defended and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.220" end="00:11:36.450" style="s2">trying to do stories about stuff that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.890" end="00:11:40.410" style="s2">could see where the cracks in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.450" end="00:11:42.420" style="s2">worldview were were kind of being shown</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.410" end="00:11:44.640" style="s2">up like psychedelic therapies for</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.420" end="00:11:47.460" style="s2">example was something like I covered</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.640" end="00:11:48.930" style="s2">from about 2008 onwards so I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.460" end="00:11:50.940" style="s2">always been really interested in like</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.930" end="00:11:55.589" style="s2">okay what what are those frames and how</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.940" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">is that truth how are those perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.589" end="00:12:00.360" style="s2">defended and perspectives held so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:03.960" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been aware and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.360" end="00:12:07.529" style="s2">interested in from well before rebel</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.960" end="00:12:09.570" style="s2">wisdom right and it&#39;s like what we said</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.529" end="00:12:11.910" style="s2">in our last chat is that each minute</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.570" end="00:12:13.170" style="s2">tribe has their own council culture and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.910" end="00:12:15.990" style="s2">you can also say they each had their own</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.170" end="00:12:19.020" style="s2">Overton Window in a sense things that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.990" end="00:12:20.730" style="s2">you should talk about not talk about but</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.020" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">here here&#39;s at me at the edge of my</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.730" end="00:12:24.600" style="s2">thinking I&#39;m curious well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:27.000" style="s2">say about this going to that go back to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.600" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">the loops is three phases of power let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.000" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">just say you have the content the</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:34.380" style="s2">propositions the agenda the frame and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:35.760" style="s2">then you got the ideology and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.380" end="00:12:37.500" style="s2">like in our sense making space in order</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.760" end="00:12:39.810" style="s2">to do good journalism we cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.500" end="00:12:40.890" style="s2">unconscious of any of those layers we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.810" end="00:12:42.360" style="s2">have to have our eyes on each one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.890" end="00:12:44.940" style="s2">them and being able to talk about them</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.360" end="00:12:52.760" style="s2">and level-set with them would you agree</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.940" end="00:12:55.410" style="s2">with that yes yeah I think I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.760" end="00:12:56.910" style="s2">yeah we have to be constantly aware of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.410" end="00:12:58.670" style="s2">what the framing is that we&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.910" end="00:13:01.080" style="s2">to something because you can&#39;t operate</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.670" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t operate completely without</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.080" end="00:13:04.230" style="s2">being in some kind of a frame so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:07.650" style="s2">think you have to be aware of when</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.230" end="00:13:10.440" style="s2">you&#39;re slipping between them Jamie will</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.650" end="00:13:12.900" style="s2">had a really beautiful analogy of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.440" end="00:13:15.060" style="s2">the phone and the different apps on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.900" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">phone so you&#39;re using different apps for</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.060" end="00:13:18.750" style="s2">different purposes but then to try and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">be clear about what you&#39;re using at what</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.750" end="00:13:23.900" style="s2">time at what time and then if you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:27.150" style="s2">kind of be aware that you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.900" end="00:13:28.920" style="s2">right and I think like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.150" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">what&#39;s really helpful into getting that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.920" end="00:13:33.510" style="s2">muscle that skill set of like being able</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:35.279" style="s2">to spot the agenda and call it out is</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.510" end="00:13:36.450" style="s2">what you and I have been playing with</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.279" end="00:13:38.220" style="s2">all these different conversational</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.450" end="00:13:39.750" style="s2">modalities where they&#39;re circling are we</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.220" end="00:13:41.670" style="s2">spacing because you you go into this</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.750" end="00:13:44.100" style="s2">sort of artificial container this</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.670" end="00:13:46.740" style="s2">modality and the rules are explicit and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.100" end="00:13:48.270" style="s2">you have to be cognizant of not only</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.740" end="00:13:49.620" style="s2">your own intention but either people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.270" end="00:13:53.010" style="s2">intention and then you get the play in</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.620" end="00:13:54.540" style="s2">that space and then I think if you you</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.010" end="00:13:56.040" style="s2">play in a nothing spaces then you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.540" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">kind of see in the wild the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.040" end="00:14:01.260" style="s2">interpersonal while like oh shit what</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:02.310" style="s2">game are we playing here and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.260" end="00:14:03.839" style="s2">usually the game that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.310" end="00:14:09.240" style="s2">instrumental eise&#39;s the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.839" end="00:14:11.339" style="s2">towards something yeah yeah and there</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.240" end="00:14:13.320" style="s2">are strong forces within culture and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.339" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">society that are saying if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:17.120" style="s2">playing that game then you&#39;re the sucker</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.790" end="00:14:23.250" style="s2">but that&#39;s the whole that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.120" end="00:14:25.470" style="s2">vibe of business is this enforcement of</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.250" end="00:14:30.270" style="s2">a kind of frame that if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.470" end="00:14:35.580" style="s2">playing that game you&#39;re you&#39;re naive or</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.270" end="00:14:38.430" style="s2">you&#39;re an idiot or Similan and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.580" end="00:14:39.779" style="s2">gonna turn to the Q&amp;A in a moment but</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.430" end="00:14:41.130" style="s2">they&#39;re going back that that framework</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.779" end="00:14:42.900" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m with find it quite useful right</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.130" end="00:14:44.279" style="s2">now the top layer the ideology layer</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.900" end="00:14:47.940" style="s2">which is something that I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.279" end="00:14:49.800" style="s2">the culture war is like even though I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.940" end="00:14:52.740" style="s2">don&#39;t think every medic tribe has equal</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.800" end="00:14:55.350" style="s2">truth claims or values I do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.740" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">helpful to act as if they are just to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">performed agnostic in order to speak to</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:04.020" style="s2">each one of them and so what is your</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:06.270" style="s2">like thoughts on when no one is certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.020" end="00:15:08.700" style="s2">about what&#39;s the right ideology or</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.270" end="00:15:10.890" style="s2">what&#39;s the right final philosophy how do</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.700" end="00:15:12.810" style="s2">we negotiate like the mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.890" end="00:15:13.950" style="s2">thing how do you think rebel wisdom or</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.810" end="00:15:15.570" style="s2">journalists how do you think we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.950" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">negotiate with all these different</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.570" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">ideologies at play</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.379" end="00:15:23.309" style="s2">maybe negotiation is the wrong word like</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.849" end="00:15:25.649" style="s2">how do you how do you hunt for the truth</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.309" end="00:15:27.059" style="s2">in a way who ain&#39;t like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.649" end="00:15:30.629" style="s2">so many different ideologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.059" end="00:15:33.869" style="s2">going to tribute it in their own way um</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.629" end="00:15:35.789" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.869" end="00:15:38.489" style="s2">probably a methodology thing as much as</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.789" end="00:15:41.699" style="s2">it is anything else like there are some</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.489" end="00:15:43.289" style="s2">questions like that there&#39;s a take an</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.699" end="00:15:48.389" style="s2">example I mean there&#39;s some truth claims</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.289" end="00:15:51.739" style="s2">going around at the moment that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.389" end="00:15:55.009" style="s2">feel equipped to do an interview around</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.739" end="00:15:58.409" style="s2">like some of these alternative medical</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.009" end="00:16:00.179" style="s2">frames around but like I get that in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.409" end="00:16:01.859" style="s2">comments a lot like what why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.179" end="00:16:04.259" style="s2">interview Judi Mick of it why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.859" end="00:16:06.509" style="s2">interview this person or that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.259" end="00:16:09.139" style="s2">like because honestly I don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.509" end="00:16:12.329" style="s2">equipped to do that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.139" end="00:16:15.329" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think that even spending</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.329" end="00:16:18.529" style="s2">half a day researching her and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.329" end="00:16:23.459" style="s2">researching her claims I could then do a</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.529" end="00:16:25.139" style="s2">good job I mean I might I might be able</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.459" end="00:16:26.549" style="s2">to do a better job than most of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.139" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">interviews that I&#39;ve seen so far with</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.549" end="00:16:31.259" style="s2">that&#39;s my other my other concern if</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:33.959" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about specific examples</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.259" end="00:16:36.059" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;ve had a bit of a kickback even</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.959" end="00:16:39.329" style="s2">today of calling these some of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.059" end="00:16:41.189" style="s2">people fringe medical figures and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.329" end="00:16:44.039" style="s2">Russell conjugation and that&#39;s me kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.189" end="00:16:45.749" style="s2">of dismissing them my concern isn&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.039" end="00:16:49.019" style="s2">I actually put that into the last film I</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.749" end="00:16:51.329" style="s2">actually tried very hard to show look</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.019" end="00:16:52.679" style="s2">there there was another doctor in so</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.329" end="00:16:54.799" style="s2">there&#39;s these these people who are being</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.679" end="00:16:58.019" style="s2">interviewed on London real for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.799" end="00:16:59.689" style="s2">Judy make of its being one rushy Butare</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.019" end="00:17:04.350" style="s2">Shiva ayyadurai</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.689" end="00:17:05.730" style="s2">who without a value and I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.350" end="00:17:07.769" style="s2">talk about it on the channel without</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.730" end="00:17:10.139" style="s2">really evaluating their truth claims and</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.769" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">people just get so triggered by you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.139" end="00:17:13.829" style="s2">talking about them at all without going</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:15.779" style="s2">into the content and I&#39;m trying very</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.829" end="00:17:17.339" style="s2">hard to say let&#39;s not go into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.779" end="00:17:20.039" style="s2">content I don&#39;t feel equipped to do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.339" end="00:17:22.350" style="s2">let&#39;s look at it as a phenomenon whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.039" end="00:17:24.419" style="s2">no matter what you think about their</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.350" end="00:17:26.549" style="s2">their claims they are getting a huge</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.419" end="00:17:28.289" style="s2">amount of traction right now it is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.549" end="00:17:32.820" style="s2">phenomenon that they are becoming hugely</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.289" end="00:17:33.570" style="s2">popular and my concern with them as an</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.820" end="00:17:36.690" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.570" end="00:17:40.740" style="s2">is that they seem to me to be only being</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.690" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">interviewed on very sympathetic by very</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.740" end="00:17:44.340" style="s2">sympathetic people because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:45.450" style="s2">basically the mainstream is saying no</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.340" end="00:17:47.519" style="s2">you&#39;re anti VAX</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.450" end="00:17:48.899" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to talk to you but</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.519" end="00:17:51.059" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these places that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.899" end="00:17:55.500" style="s2">hungry for views that are interviewing</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.059" end="00:17:57.779" style="s2">them in a very sympathetic way and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.500" end="00:18:01.500" style="s2">their ideas are not being challenged and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.779" end="00:18:03.090" style="s2">there is no like and I tried very hard</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.500" end="00:18:05.639" style="s2">in that to say look there&#39;s another guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.090" end="00:18:10.379" style="s2">in New York who put out a video and said</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.639" end="00:18:11.879" style="s2">hey something&#39;s going on what I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.379" end="00:18:14.399" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look like pneumonia it looks</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.879" end="00:18:15.929" style="s2">like altitude sickness and then a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.399" end="00:18:17.309" style="s2">of weeks afterwards what he was</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.929" end="00:18:18.570" style="s2">observing is now part of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.309" end="00:18:20.250" style="s2">understanding of what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.570" end="00:18:22.289" style="s2">Kovac so it&#39;s like I was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.250" end="00:18:24.840" style="s2">that you can&#39;t shut down you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.289" end="00:18:28.679" style="s2">shut out someone who at the moment has</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.840" end="00:18:32.250" style="s2">has by definition a fringe or a minority</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.679" end="00:18:33.600" style="s2">view like these are these are important</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.250" end="00:18:35.820" style="s2">voices and actually they&#39;re important</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.600" end="00:18:39.000" style="s2">things that then get put into the into</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.820" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">the conversation but at the same time my</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.000" end="00:18:46.049" style="s2">concern is that free speech without the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">the idea is being challenged in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.049" end="00:18:50.639" style="s2">marketplace of accountability is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.230" style="s2">free speech it&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.639" end="00:18:54.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like profits propaganda and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.230" end="00:18:56.460" style="s2">not being challenged so that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.240" end="00:18:58.590" style="s2">this kind of interregnum where we used</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.460" end="00:19:00.299" style="s2">to have a structure that kind of worked</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:02.159" style="s2">we&#39;d have figures who would go onto</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.299" end="00:19:03.659" style="s2">channels they would say what they said</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.159" end="00:19:05.820" style="s2">they&#39;d be challenged by journalists</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.659" end="00:19:08.639" style="s2">probably health journalists who knew</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.820" end="00:19:10.409" style="s2">that the area pretty well they then go</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.639" end="00:19:11.669" style="s2">on to other other channels and people</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.409" end="00:19:13.230" style="s2">would watch the previous interviews</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.669" end="00:19:15.200" style="s2">they&#39;d asked them questions based on</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.230" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">that you&#39;d have this sifting of of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.200" end="00:19:20.190" style="s2">expertise and of good answers and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:21.809" style="s2">have this process right now it feels</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.190" end="00:19:26.279" style="s2">like we&#39;ve got these self-enclosed</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.809" end="00:19:28.080" style="s2">ecosystems and again I&#39;m trying to talk</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.279" end="00:19:31.049" style="s2">about this in a way that is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.080" end="00:19:32.970" style="s2">dismissing an essentially use of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.049" end="00:19:34.470" style="s2">conspiracy theory or alternative</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.970" end="00:19:38.070" style="s2">viewpoint or anything people get like</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.470" end="00:19:41.160" style="s2">Rudy your interview doing this</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.070" end="00:19:43.590" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m trying to look at it as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.160" end="00:19:45.870" style="s2">phenomenon without judging or or</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.590" end="00:19:48.060" style="s2">assessing the the value of the truth</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.870" end="00:19:50.700" style="s2">claims like I&#39;m trying to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.060" end="00:19:53.820" style="s2">space of saying I&#39;m seeing a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.700" end="00:19:55.560" style="s2">that worries me because on one side</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.820" end="00:19:57.030" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the traditional media or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.560" end="00:19:59.610" style="s2">mainstream that&#39;s not taking these</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.030" end="00:20:01.140" style="s2">things seriously and thinking they can</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.610" end="00:20:03.330" style="s2">do what they&#39;ve always done which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.140" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">like get keep everyone they don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.330" end="00:20:06.510" style="s2">out the conversation and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:09.000" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna work anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.510" end="00:20:10.410" style="s2">I think that&#39;s an old modality I think I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.000" end="00:20:13.140" style="s2">even said in the piece they put out look</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.410" end="00:20:14.850" style="s2">David Icke he&#39;s been saying the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.140" end="00:20:16.530" style="s2">thing that he&#39;s been saying for 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.850" end="00:20:20.040" style="s2">talking about this global fascist state</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.530" end="00:20:22.110" style="s2">I don&#39;t think and I i I have some</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.040" end="00:20:24.690" style="s2">respect for him for that he didn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:27.540" style="s2">for me someone that Alex Jones shifts</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.690" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">and just he finds what&#39;s what what goes</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.540" end="00:20:31.620" style="s2">well it&#39;s conspiracy as entertainment he</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:33.450" style="s2">moves he shit he&#39;s really believed a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.620" end="00:20:34.830" style="s2">of the stuff he&#39;s saying David Icke does</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.450" end="00:20:37.530" style="s2">believe a lot the stuff you say and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.830" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">think Fred Plato in 30 years of talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.530" end="00:20:42.390" style="s2">about lizard people and stuff that if he</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:44.310" style="s2">if he&#39;d only change that he could have</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.390" end="00:20:46.460" style="s2">been way more popular if he&#39;d gone down</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.310" end="00:20:49.860" style="s2">the kind of anti-globalist route that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.460" end="00:20:51.090" style="s2">that Jones went down I think he&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.860" end="00:20:52.860" style="s2">been more popular but he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.090" end="00:20:55.920" style="s2">stuff that makes it load of people think</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.860" end="00:20:57.240" style="s2">man you&#39;re you&#39;re way too far out for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.920" end="00:20:59.010" style="s2">you say some good stuff but you also</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.240" end="00:21:01.680" style="s2">come in with the 12-foot lizards and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.010" end="00:21:02.940" style="s2">the British royal family being cannibals</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.680" end="00:21:04.920" style="s2">and all that sort of stuff and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.940" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">little bit too much fair Plato he stayed</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.920" end="00:21:09.240" style="s2">true to his guns and I think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">on one side you&#39;ve got the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.240" end="00:21:12.960" style="s2">thinking they can still get keep out all</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.790" style="s2">of the alternative voices and that will</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.960" end="00:21:17.220" style="s2">make a difference and it won&#39;t so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.790" end="00:21:20.450" style="s2">think lots more people have to be part</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.220" end="00:21:22.860" style="s2">of the conversation and that means</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.450" end="00:21:24.660" style="s2">platforming in their language people who</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.860" end="00:21:27.360" style="s2">they would have always said we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.660" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">platform in the past so that&#39;s on one</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.360" end="00:21:31.910" style="s2">side and then you&#39;ve got on the other</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:37.560" style="s2">side this kind of uncanny valley of</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.910" end="00:21:39.210" style="s2">these these people not being these truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.560" end="00:21:41.310" style="s2">claims are not being subject to scrutiny</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.210" end="00:21:43.860" style="s2">and so you&#39;ve got these kind of little</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.310" end="00:21:46.680" style="s2">ecosystems and I&#39;m trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.860" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">this in a way of like look this is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.680" end="00:21:49.080" style="s2">I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.320" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to hold this meta</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.080" end="00:21:52.850" style="s2">perspective and it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.320" end="00:21:54.410" style="s2">with conspiracy theory in particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.850" end="00:21:54.920" style="s2">because people just lose their fucking</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.410" end="00:21:57.410" style="s2">shit</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.920" end="00:21:59.210" style="s2">they absolutely lose their fucking shit</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.410" end="00:22:00.860" style="s2">in the comments especially and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.210" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">like why aren&#39;t you talking about Bill</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.860" end="00:22:03.230" style="s2">Gates</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:05.810" style="s2">why aren&#39;t you investigating the plot to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.230" end="00:22:08.060" style="s2">cold most of humanity why onion is like</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.810" end="00:22:10.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.060" end="00:22:15.970" style="s2">right now is the impossibility of trying</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.940" end="00:22:18.890" style="s2">to hold a meta frame when people are so</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.970" end="00:22:22.040" style="s2">religiously triggered by the subject and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.890" end="00:22:24.380" style="s2">are so obsessed with this is the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.040" end="00:22:27.620" style="s2">important thing and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.380" end="00:22:29.180" style="s2">really wrestling with is just in maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.620" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">should ignore the comments but I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.180" end="00:22:35.330" style="s2">I want to kind of be open to criticism</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:39.740" style="s2">and open to self-reflection but at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.330" end="00:22:40.910" style="s2">same time it&#39;s like this and conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.740" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">theory is the thing that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.910" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">overwhelmingly like this is the central</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:46.370" style="s2">story as far as I can tell as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:49.670" style="s2">journalist right now that is of interest</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.370" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2">and needs to be needs to be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.670" end="00:22:56.890" style="s2">but I feel so incredibly exposed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.730" end="00:23:05.270" style="s2">yeah I feel it&#39;s such a difficult one to</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.350" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">talk about and because yeah just just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.270" end="00:23:08.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s almost impossible because</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">people just immediately degenerate down</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.870" end="00:23:12.290" style="s2">to you&#39;re controlled opposition and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:13.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.290" end="00:23:15.530" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked at this piece you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.610" end="00:23:20.180" style="s2">looked at that piece so trying to talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.530" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">about it from a meta frame is is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.180" end="00:23:25.700" style="s2">difficult and I&#39;ll also say yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:27.830" style="s2">getting kind of a little bit activated</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.700" end="00:23:29.450" style="s2">around it just just peak because people</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.830" end="00:23:32.540" style="s2">say oh you&#39;re controlled opposition</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.450" end="00:23:34.460" style="s2">you&#39;re scared of it it&#39;s like do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:36.830" style="s2">really not think that putting stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.460" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">in this area is not like difficult</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.830" end="00:23:44.750" style="s2">enough do you not think that yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:46.430" style="s2">like that that annoys me is like this</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.750" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">this constant like are you&#39;re just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.430" end="00:23:50.060" style="s2">mainstream chill because you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:51.560" style="s2">calling out Bill Gates look fucking</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.060" end="00:23:52.910" style="s2">loads of YouTube channels calling out</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.560" end="00:23:54.590" style="s2">Bill Gates stop trying to make my</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.910" end="00:23:56.600" style="s2">YouTube channel to every other fucking</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.600" end="00:24:00.460" style="s2">somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.410" end="00:24:02.570" style="s2">I&#39;m putting the stuff out for free sorry</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.460" end="00:24:04.919" style="s2">so if you ever want to trigger day</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.570" end="00:24:11.739" style="s2">before just calm controlled opposition</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.919" end="00:24:12.849" style="s2">I&#39;m out yeah so I do have another</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.739" end="00:24:17.769" style="s2">questions it&#39;s that&#39;s alive and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.849" end="00:24:19.479" style="s2">we&#39;ll jump into Q&amp;A so my read is that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.769" end="00:24:21.009" style="s2">like we sit up at the blue church cuz</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.479" end="00:24:22.899" style="s2">that can like quickly become like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.009" end="00:24:26.169" style="s2">mongrel concept you know like a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.899" end="00:24:28.209" style="s2">crew concept and my sense how you relate</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.169" end="00:24:30.070" style="s2">to sort of like the the phenomenon of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.209" end="00:24:31.690" style="s2">is that I think you would acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.070" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">that the institutions that were</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.690" end="00:24:36.569" style="s2">referring to as Abu Church have been</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:39.009" style="s2">corrupted but the procedures in their</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.569" end="00:24:40.539" style="s2">methodology should not be thrown out we</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.009" end="00:24:41.709" style="s2">should kind of take the best of that and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.539" end="00:24:46.179" style="s2">repurpose it into this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.709" end="00:24:47.709" style="s2">decentralized environment yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.179" end="00:24:48.819" style="s2">and I sent you this message on what</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.709" end="00:24:50.169" style="s2">suppose it&#39;s like a ten minute message</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.819" end="00:24:51.309" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think I got a proper</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.169" end="00:24:53.019" style="s2">response for my so I&#39;m gonna ask it</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.309" end="00:24:55.929" style="s2">again and then I think it&#39;s relates to</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.019" end="00:24:57.249" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about here is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.929" end="00:24:58.959" style="s2">like the one line everything right</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.249" end="00:25:01.449" style="s2">you&#39;re like a fucking talented</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.959" end="00:25:02.709" style="s2">journalist you you know you&#39;ve done all</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.449" end="00:25:04.059" style="s2">this emotional work you have a great</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.709" end="00:25:05.799" style="s2">platform it&#39;s a gold standard the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.059" end="00:25:07.749" style="s2">sense-making web in my opinion and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.799" end="00:25:09.309" style="s2">of people&#39;s opinions as well but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.749" end="00:25:12.069" style="s2">almost like a one-man army you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.309" end="00:25:14.049" style="s2">like it&#39;s David fuller and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.069" end="00:25:14.859" style="s2">get squashed like a bug with all these</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.049" end="00:25:16.419" style="s2">kind of like this conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.859" end="00:25:18.239" style="s2">thought-forces pair of political stuff</p>

<p begin="00:25:52.879" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">channel for news it&#39;s sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.470" end="00:26:00.590" style="s2">tribute and and the thought the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">theme of this 15 minute film was fuck it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.590" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">I&#39;ll do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:05.659" style="s2">with everyone in the newsroom going fuck</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.700" end="00:26:08.149" style="s2">it I&#39;ll do it myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.659" end="00:26:10.789" style="s2">so I mean rebel ISM is not just a one</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.149" end="00:26:14.809" style="s2">man army Alexander Bynum I think&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.789" end="00:26:16.669" style="s2">on here as well is is my co-founder but</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.809" end="00:26:20.299" style="s2">in terms of the media side that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.669" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">basically me I shoot I edit I produce a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.299" end="00:26:26.629" style="s2">report I do everything myself</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:28.369" style="s2">so that and and I guess the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.629" end="00:26:30.200" style="s2">I do that like the reason I&#39;ve gained</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.369" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">all of those skills over the last 20</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:37.450" style="s2">years is because I I&#39;m pretty impatient</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:39.679" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty single-minded and I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.450" end="00:26:42.679" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m pretty impatient actually I</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:45.230" style="s2">think that&#39;s the main thing and probably</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.679" end="00:26:49.009" style="s2">don&#39;t work well with us that&#39;s angry and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.230" end="00:26:50.539" style="s2">impatient therefore that&#39;s my air for</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.009" end="00:26:52.070" style="s2">sure Peter I mean you&#39;ve tapped on</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.539" end="00:26:55.369" style="s2">something like that my area for growth</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.070" end="00:26:57.409" style="s2">is how do i scale what rebel wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.369" end="00:27:01.429" style="s2">doing and I don&#39;t know the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.409" end="00:27:03.289" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.429" end="00:27:04.909" style="s2">would look like to be honest but I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.289" end="00:27:07.669" style="s2">think that&#39;s necessary I mean we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.909" end="00:27:09.830" style="s2">talked about like ID I&#39;ve also fairly</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.669" end="00:27:13.460" style="s2">grandiose I do think there&#39;s a space in</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.830" end="00:27:16.269" style="s2">the media landscape for a kind of vice</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.460" end="00:27:19.970" style="s2">with heart like Vice is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.269" end="00:27:22.129" style="s2">collapsing under the weight of internal</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.970" end="00:27:24.409" style="s2">corruption too much kind of ideological</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.129" end="00:27:27.470" style="s2">capture all these sort of things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.409" end="00:27:29.419" style="s2">there is a space for treating these kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.470" end="00:27:32.389" style="s2">of topics a sort of transformation or</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.419" end="00:27:33.889" style="s2">spiritual like I can feel the outlines</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.389" end="00:27:36.230" style="s2">of that space and I think that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.889" end="00:27:39.559" style="s2">as good a chance of getting in there as</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.230" end="00:27:41.749" style="s2">anyone but I don&#39;t know how to how to</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.559" end="00:27:44.119" style="s2">how to go about it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.749" end="00:27:45.679" style="s2">yeah and just for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.119" end="00:27:47.359" style="s2">listening I&#39;m a Toronto correspondent</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.679" end="00:27:48.649" style="s2">for rebel wisdom and so there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.359" end="00:27:49.850" style="s2">personal interest to me like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.649" end="00:27:51.830" style="s2">have your talent stack and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.850" end="00:27:55.580" style="s2">journalistic sense but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.830" end="00:27:57.510" style="s2">an eagerness there to to engage in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.580" end="00:27:59.070" style="s2">and then sort of maybe what</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.510" end="00:28:01.770" style="s2">is probably the wrong word but to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.070" end="00:28:03.210" style="s2">of activate people who are inspired to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.770" end="00:28:05.250" style="s2">do it as well but the question is how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.210" end="00:28:07.350" style="s2">do it so if anyone has any thoughts you</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.250" end="00:28:10.980" style="s2">know we were curious to hear but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.350" end="00:28:12.930" style="s2">turn to some questions Tyson if you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.980" end="00:28:16.140" style="s2">unmute yourself and asked David your</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.930" end="00:28:19.410" style="s2">question sure thank you</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.140" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">let&#39;s see thank you David for being here</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.410" end="00:28:26.550" style="s2">and like taking on more than your load</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:28.230" style="s2">like I really appreciate you for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.550" end="00:28:30.210" style="s2">work that you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.230" end="00:28:34.680" style="s2">just very influential and important for</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.210" end="00:28:37.320" style="s2">me lately and my question here is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.680" end="00:28:40.170" style="s2">so with the whole dreaming of its thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.320" end="00:28:42.720" style="s2">I myself I found myself like yearning</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.170" end="00:28:44.640" style="s2">for like someone that doesn&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.720" end="00:28:46.710" style="s2">her and isn&#39;t so sympathetic please like</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.640" end="00:28:48.900" style="s2">interviewer where can I get this and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.710" end="00:28:52.500" style="s2">can see the same for number of figures</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.900" end="00:28:54.420" style="s2">and so you said something like you might</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.500" end="00:28:57.240" style="s2">not you don&#39;t feel equipped or prepared</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.420" end="00:29:01.560" style="s2">or something like that to do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.240" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">interview and so I just and and I even</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.560" end="00:29:04.980" style="s2">found myself like I even tweeted Erik</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:05.640" style="s2">Weinstein and I asked him like if you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.980" end="00:29:07.140" style="s2">interview her</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.640" end="00:29:08.910" style="s2">because I have this sense like I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.140" end="00:29:10.380" style="s2">want and it&#39;s not because I need to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.910" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">because I agree with her or I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.380" end="00:29:14.450" style="s2">with her it&#39;s because I want better</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:17.700" style="s2">examples of like how this should be done</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.450" end="00:29:19.440" style="s2">and I&#39;ve and I&#39;ve been following Bryan</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.700" end="00:29:21.450" style="s2">Rose for years and used to really like</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:23.550" style="s2">not yeah and I had a lot of respect for</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.450" end="00:29:25.590" style="s2">him and his work so it&#39;s just I really</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.550" end="00:29:27.450" style="s2">want stronger examples of how this</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.590" end="00:29:30.740" style="s2">should be done and so I guess now my</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.450" end="00:29:35.010" style="s2">question was whether or not we need new</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.740" end="00:29:37.350" style="s2">platforms or if we need some sort of way</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.010" end="00:29:40.680" style="s2">of organizing to influence these</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.350" end="00:29:44.610" style="s2">platforms and then so what would maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.680" end="00:29:47.070" style="s2">help you feel comfortable doing some of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.610" end="00:29:50.580" style="s2">these interviews that are at the edge or</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.070" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">that that sort of risk all of that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.580" end="00:29:55.380" style="s2">of that push back and so we have whether</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:29:56.990" style="s2">that is like a platform where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.380" end="00:30:00.170" style="s2">like inherent agreements and</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.990" end="00:30:02.430" style="s2">understanding amongst viewers of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.170" end="00:30:03.620" style="s2">spirit of where that the enquiries are</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.430" end="00:30:06.270" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.620" end="00:30:07.410" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m just curious that comes up what</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.270" end="00:30:09.360" style="s2">comes up for you they&#39;re like do we need</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.410" end="00:30:11.430" style="s2">a whole new container and a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.360" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">environment and platforms or</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.430" end="00:30:14.220" style="s2">is there something that would make you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:18.090" style="s2">feel more comfortable taking on some of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.220" end="00:30:19.740" style="s2">those conversations well I think just</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.090" end="00:30:23.400" style="s2">thinking about that as an example say</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.740" end="00:30:27.990" style="s2">Judy megabits I think I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.400" end="00:30:30.870" style="s2">some things that I would feel confident</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.990" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">asking her which would be some of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.870" end="00:30:35.700" style="s2">discrepancies in the account or in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:37.830" style="s2">sort of plan Zdenek film compared to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.700" end="00:30:39.570" style="s2">what&#39;s publicly available in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.830" end="00:30:42.330" style="s2">her arrest and stuff like that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.570" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">that&#39;s fairly obvious what I&#39;d be also</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.330" end="00:30:47.400" style="s2">wary I think the way to do it I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:50.430" style="s2">of thinking as I&#39;m as you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.400" end="00:30:52.170" style="s2">would be to try and find someone who was</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.430" end="00:30:54.900" style="s2">equipped to do that and to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.170" end="00:30:56.610" style="s2">the person to hold that conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.900" end="00:31:00.960" style="s2">actually have a three-way conversation</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.610" end="00:31:02.940" style="s2">with someone who is who was medically</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.960" end="00:31:06.540" style="s2">trained it would be able to go in</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.940" end="00:31:09.420" style="s2">because I would be worried about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.540" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2">what I&#39;m we&#39;re wary of the optics of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.420" end="00:31:16.970" style="s2">being in that position of coz I just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:22.590" style="s2">other thing is people don&#39;t get online</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.970" end="00:31:25.490" style="s2">what what healthy come what healthy</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.590" end="00:31:28.440" style="s2">challenge looks like and they basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.490" end="00:31:30.060" style="s2">assume that you are like I had that with</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.440" end="00:31:34.170" style="s2">Eric Weinstein when I when I did the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.060" end="00:31:36.450" style="s2">interview about Epstein and the disk and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.170" end="00:31:39.300" style="s2">I and I wanted to put myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.450" end="00:31:40.920" style="s2">position of challenging him because I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.300" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">was aware of what we were going into was</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.920" end="00:31:45.210" style="s2">kind of controversial and also I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:46.470" style="s2">necessarily agree with everything that</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.210" end="00:31:49.440" style="s2">he&#39;s saying about the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.470" end="00:31:52.410" style="s2">degeneration of the media I&#39;m genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.440" end="00:31:54.300" style="s2">puzzled by why they haven&#39;t like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.410" end="00:31:56.010" style="s2">understand for example what panorama the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.300" end="00:31:58.470" style="s2">BBC documentary isn&#39;t doing something</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.010" end="00:32:01.320" style="s2">about Epstein I would be astonished if</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.470" end="00:32:02.400" style="s2">they weren&#39;t given the given I know lots</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.320" end="00:32:05.210" style="s2">of the people who work on that program</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.400" end="00:32:10.470" style="s2">and I know how it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big story</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.210" end="00:32:11.790" style="s2">with big UK connections I mean news</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.470" end="00:32:13.320" style="s2">night did the interview with Prince</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.790" end="00:32:16.110" style="s2">Andrew and they were chasing that for</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.320" end="00:32:17.610" style="s2">months asking Buckingham Palace like</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.110" end="00:32:20.370" style="s2">time and time again to have an ingenue</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.610" end="00:32:21.870" style="s2">so the idea that so I wanted to hold</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.370" end="00:32:23.340" style="s2">that place of like pushing back a little</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.340" end="00:32:26.760" style="s2">comments people</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.690" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">look at this she&#39;ll mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.760" end="00:32:33.420" style="s2">journalists like like people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:35.370" style="s2">understand what like that we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.420" end="00:32:37.890" style="s2">this kind of ability to differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.370" end="00:32:40.170" style="s2">between the person and the job and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.890" end="00:32:42.090" style="s2">whole point of journalism when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.170" end="00:32:44.730" style="s2">practiced correctly is that it&#39;s a set</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.090" end="00:32:47.550" style="s2">of it&#39;s a set of in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.730" end="00:32:50.100" style="s2">being a lawyer like being a lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.550" end="00:32:51.420" style="s2">involves doing a professional job it</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.100" end="00:32:53.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you have to believe the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.420" end="00:32:55.260" style="s2">person you&#39;re representing or believe</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.730" end="00:32:58.470" style="s2">that the person that you&#39;re opposing</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.260" end="00:33:00.150" style="s2">needs to be convicted it&#39;s like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.470" end="00:33:02.070" style="s2">got a job to do and you&#39;ve got a job to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.150" end="00:33:03.660" style="s2">do within this and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.070" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">especially online people just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.660" end="00:33:08.010" style="s2">understand so if I put myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:11.340" style="s2">position of interviewing Judy Mike of</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.010" end="00:33:14.690" style="s2">its and did did a proper job the optics</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.340" end="00:33:18.330" style="s2">of that I think would would just lead to</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.690" end="00:33:20.010" style="s2">me being and it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.330" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">what I&#39;ve done previously like I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.010" end="00:33:24.900" style="s2">in some ways I&#39;ve built up a track</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:27.480" style="s2">record in some interviews are taking</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.900" end="00:33:29.520" style="s2">different perspectives but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.480" end="00:33:30.900" style="s2">matter because most people will only see</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.520" end="00:33:32.810" style="s2">me in that one interview will just go on</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.900" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">look at that fucking BBC journalist</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.810" end="00:33:41.580" style="s2">she&#39;ll asshole attacking Judy Mick of</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:43.110" style="s2">its and and that I think so I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.580" end="00:33:44.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost that ability I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.110" end="00:33:46.610" style="s2">lost that ability especially on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.730" end="00:33:48.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve got comments thread of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.610" end="00:33:50.670" style="s2">differentiating between the job and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.630" end="00:33:52.860" style="s2">person and so those things are just</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.670" end="00:33:54.420" style="s2">they&#39;re stuck together now and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.860" end="00:33:56.940" style="s2">think we&#39;ll be able to kind of pull them</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.420" end="00:33:59.130" style="s2">apart again so I think the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.940" end="00:34:01.860" style="s2">do it would be to get on someone to hold</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.130" end="00:34:04.350" style="s2">that other pole and then you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.860" end="00:34:06.630" style="s2">think about who that might be and then</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.350" end="00:34:10.230" style="s2">manage that conversation and probably</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.630" end="00:34:12.660" style="s2">step into that role of trying to be a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.230" end="00:34:17.520" style="s2">kind of neutral observer and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.660" end="00:34:19.450" style="s2">really that&#39;s a really tricky role to</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.520" end="00:34:22.510" style="s2">fill</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.450" end="00:34:23.980" style="s2">and I don&#39;t quite know and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.510" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">got the paradox now I&#39;m wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.980" end="00:34:28.389" style="s2">this all the time it&#39;s like I do have</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:30.190" style="s2">opinions and I do I feel more and more</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.389" end="00:34:34.300" style="s2">tempted to actually bring my opinions</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.190" end="00:34:38.829" style="s2">out and kind of to to play more of a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.300" end="00:34:41.589" style="s2">role but I also feel that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.829" end="00:34:43.829" style="s2">really looking for is is is someone or</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.589" end="00:34:48.190" style="s2">something to play a kind of trusted</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.829" end="00:34:49.990" style="s2">mediation role and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.190" end="00:34:51.579" style="s2">know how to resolve that because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.990" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">more I put my own opinions out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.579" end="00:34:54.070" style="s2">especially about some of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:55.990" style="s2">controversial topics the less I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.070" end="00:35:00.230" style="s2">seen as someone who can actually kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.990" end="00:35:03.530" style="s2">hold a neutral space in in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.230" end="00:35:05.119" style="s2">yeah mediating it right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.530" end="00:35:06.980" style="s2">interesting because the terms that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.119" end="00:35:09.770" style="s2">Connor Barnes and I did in that culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.980" end="00:35:12.500" style="s2">paper is a dirty bias or clean bias and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.770" end="00:35:14.059" style="s2">it&#39;s like if like clean biases is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.500" end="00:35:15.890" style="s2">admitting your bias and then trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.059" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">be searched for the truth but if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.890" end="00:35:19.339" style="s2">don&#39;t do that there&#39;s this like sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">inauthenticity about this performative</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.339" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">neutrality and you have like a dirty</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:25.280" style="s2">biased feeling associated with that so</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.540" style="s2">it is very very challenging I think to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.280" end="00:35:28.309" style="s2">engage with I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.540" end="00:35:31.069" style="s2">really got it right yet except maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.309" end="00:35:32.630" style="s2">you&#39;re the closest one well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.069" end="00:35:34.369" style="s2">I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.630" end="00:35:35.809" style="s2">I think everyone&#39;s gonna lose their shit</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.369" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">with the next film on cut outs but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.809" end="00:35:40.940" style="s2">we well we just might see angry fuller</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:43.190" style="s2">just be angry at the film that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.940" end="00:35:46.130" style="s2">actually I just thought that I might do</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.190" end="00:35:47.540" style="s2">that I mean that&#39;s one other I might</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.130" end="00:35:50.440" style="s2">just put out something where I just ran</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.540" end="00:35:53.030" style="s2">and just say look fucking sort it out</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.440" end="00:35:54.380" style="s2">stop asking that in the comments and if</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.030" end="00:35:56.599" style="s2">you&#39;re not up to it then find another</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.380" end="00:35:58.130" style="s2">channel because I want more from you</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.599" end="00:35:58.609" style="s2">guys in this this is just not good</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.130" end="00:36:00.799" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.609" end="00:36:03.680" style="s2">nice we got some yeses in the chats and</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.799" end="00:36:06.170" style="s2">shaking heads so the story proves let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.680" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">just put it that way so we had version</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:12.049" style="s2">madness Helen I&#39;m not taking it anymore</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.049" end="00:36:18.530" style="s2">I think I mean honestly I I&#39;m seriously</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.609" end="00:36:20.049" style="s2">thinking about that because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.530" end="00:36:22.280" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna come out kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.049" end="00:36:25.760" style="s2">subconsciously anyway it&#39;s like right</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.280" end="00:36:28.970" style="s2">guys shape up stop reading the comments</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.760" end="00:36:33.410" style="s2">kind of I I am trying not to take it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.970" end="00:36:35.119" style="s2">seriously and Joe Rogan does say don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.410" end="00:36:38.869" style="s2">look at the comments but at the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.119" end="00:36:40.849" style="s2">time the whole project is framed around</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.869" end="00:36:42.790" style="s2">being open to feedback and being like I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.849" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to do that I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.790" end="00:36:48.260" style="s2">how because I the comments thread is</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:50.390" style="s2">just not conducive to like genuine</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.260" end="00:36:51.980" style="s2">dialogue of genuine feedback and when</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.390" end="00:36:53.210" style="s2">you see a good comment where someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.980" end="00:36:55.569" style="s2">actually taken some time to put</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.210" end="00:36:57.859" style="s2">something together well that&#39;s unusual</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.569" end="00:36:59.780" style="s2">but then people get very upset if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.859" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">delete them I mean I do delete some</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.780" end="00:37:04.250" style="s2">comments if it&#39;s just like not if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:07.099" style="s2">just completely reactive and not taking</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.250" end="00:37:12.250" style="s2">any taking us forward then I I&#39;ll admit</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.099" end="00:37:13.640" style="s2">I have deleted you YouTube comments but</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.640" end="00:37:18.380" style="s2">know where the right place to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.990" end="00:37:19.789" style="s2">engage in those dialogues is because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.380" end="00:37:24.680" style="s2">don&#39;t argue on Facebook much anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.789" end="00:37:26.359" style="s2">that&#39;s because I at the store we for I</p>

<p begin="00:37:26.359" end="00:37:29.390" style="s2">though we post these because like you</p>

<p begin="00:38:03.099" end="00:38:10.819" style="s2">free speech absolutist elute ISM sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.740" end="00:38:13.900" style="s2">being opposed to curation when I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.819" end="00:38:16.630" style="s2">of creation I think of one person using</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.900" end="00:38:19.789" style="s2">kind of their unified sense to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.630" end="00:38:21.829" style="s2">decide like what is worth sharing do you</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.640" end="00:38:32.539" style="s2">thing is there some way to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.619" end="00:38:36.049" style="s2">synthesize these things to have some</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.539" end="00:38:39.170" style="s2">kind of what would you say like a</p>

<p begin="00:43:52.590" end="00:43:57.810" style="s2">think it&#39;s a case of I think it&#39;s a case</p>

<p begin="00:43:57.810" end="00:44:03.860" style="s2">than it is a set of principles and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.800" end="00:44:07.800" style="s2">like how do we create healthy ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.860" end="00:44:10.340" style="s2">that&#39;s the question I think fertile soil</p>

<p begin="00:44:10.340" end="00:44:21.540" style="s2">Jordan you had a question hey David</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.410" end="00:44:23.820" style="s2">am I on right okay so I am you saying</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.540" end="00:44:27.810" style="s2">that you&#39;re you very terrified of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.820" end="00:44:29.880" style="s2">idea of the post blue church when the</p>

<p begin="00:44:29.880" end="00:44:38.310" style="s2">comment on exactly why that is so scary</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.240" end="00:44:39.600" style="s2">I think if you&#39;re not scared by that</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.310" end="00:44:44.310" style="s2">prospect you haven&#39;t really understood</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.600" end="00:44:48.330" style="s2">what it means like just take just take</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.310" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">so the blue church is pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.330" end="00:44:51.720" style="s2">everything I mean if you if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.950" end="00:44:53.490" style="s2">it quite narrowly as like and I think a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.720" end="00:44:55.080" style="s2">lot of people who are kind of clapping</p>

<p begin="00:45:48.260" end="00:45:55.620" style="s2">building all these all these systems the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.030" end="00:45:59.250" style="s2">World Bank the UN the all of these</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.620" end="00:46:01.800" style="s2">systems which all have their flaws as</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.250" end="00:46:04.890" style="s2">well but they they kind of what the IMF</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.800" end="00:46:06.760" style="s2">I mean they kind of worked and they</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.890" end="00:46:08.890" style="s2">worked like it</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.760" end="00:46:11.530" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t take for granted that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.890" end="00:46:13.240" style="s2">situation we&#39;ve had over the last 70 or</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.530" end="00:46:16.000" style="s2">80 years and I think far too many of us</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.240" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">are like this is not we can look for all</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.000" end="00:46:18.730" style="s2">the corruption and all of the holes and</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">all of the things that was leaving out</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.730" end="00:46:22.750" style="s2">but for fuck&#39;s sake look around you kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:25.180" style="s2">of as Peterson says like look around</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.750" end="00:46:27.420" style="s2">what a fucking miracle it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.180" end="00:46:31.260" style="s2">don&#39;t live in a society like I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.420" end="00:46:34.300" style="s2">I&#39;ve worked around the world in Haiti in</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.260" end="00:46:38.230" style="s2">Africa and like these we are we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.300" end="00:46:40.450" style="s2">pretty miraculous situation and I just</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.230" end="00:46:45.370" style="s2">look for example at like this blue</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.450" end="00:46:46.870" style="s2">church this blue church entity in</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.370" end="00:46:49.050" style="s2">foreign affairs which is the area I know</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.870" end="00:46:52.390" style="s2">very well and I look at the way that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.050" end="00:46:55.300" style="s2">Trump and other forces are just</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.390" end="00:46:57.340" style="s2">obliterating all of these structures and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.300" end="00:46:58.990" style="s2">we&#39;re going back to great power politics</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.340" end="00:47:03.010" style="s2">we&#39;re going back to might makes right</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.990" end="00:47:04.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going back to and might makes</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.010" end="00:47:06.550" style="s2">right in a world where China is probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.840" end="00:47:08.170" style="s2">going to come out of this crisis as the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.550" end="00:47:13.570" style="s2">dominant superpower with everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.170" end="00:47:16.330" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and they are arguably on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.570" end="00:47:17.770" style="s2">par with some of the stuff they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.330" end="00:47:20.140" style="s2">is on a par with some some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.770" end="00:47:23.770" style="s2">that the Germany was doing in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.140" end="00:47:25.810" style="s2">and 40s like do you realize what that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.770" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">means do you realize what the disruption</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.810" end="00:47:30.850" style="s2">of that system that we&#39;ve taken for</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:33.880" style="s2">granted actually means in practice like</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.850" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">do you realize how much that like we</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.880" end="00:47:37.480" style="s2">talked about kind of the caterpillar and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:40.510" style="s2">the butterfly like that liquification</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.480" end="00:47:45.340" style="s2">process it&#39;s fucking is gonna be fucking</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.510" end="00:47:49.330" style="s2">terrifying and like do you do you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.340" end="00:47:51.790" style="s2">what that like everyone I think who I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.330" end="00:47:54.090" style="s2">worked with like who kind of understands</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.790" end="00:47:58.530" style="s2">the way the world works from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.090" end="00:48:02.470" style="s2">institutions perspective is just like oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.530" end="00:48:04.510" style="s2">my fucking god we are and who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.470" end="00:48:06.130" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be it&#39;s gonna be I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.510" end="00:48:08.730" style="s2">nothing&#39;s off the table I mean warfare</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.130" end="00:48:12.580" style="s2">including nuclear war is on the table</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.730" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">massive societal uprooting like we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.580" end="00:48:15.250" style="s2">got no idea what the society on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:17.320" style="s2">other side of this is gonna look like</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.250" end="00:48:20.200" style="s2">and there&#39;s so many different ways it</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.320" end="00:48:21.790" style="s2">could go so that&#39;s what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.200" end="00:48:23.109" style="s2">I think this is one thing I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.790" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">have a conversation with Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.109" end="00:48:27.099" style="s2">about even from a sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">perspective like if we lose the</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.099" end="00:48:30.490" style="s2">institutions of the blue church we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.920" style="s2">lose the institutional memory of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.490" end="00:48:37.570" style="s2">like newsrooms of making sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.920" end="00:48:40.530" style="s2">world like without anything meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.570" end="00:48:43.540" style="s2">to on the other side of that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.530" end="00:48:46.180" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m up for that as a kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.540" end="00:48:48.490" style="s2">experiment and I&#39;m up for it as a like</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.180" end="00:48:51.550" style="s2">okay let&#39;s take the plunge and I but</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.490" end="00:48:52.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like we don&#39;t know what the world</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.550" end="00:48:54.910" style="s2">on the other side of it&#39;s gonna look</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.599" end="00:48:57.700" style="s2">like I have faith that something will</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.910" end="00:49:00.030" style="s2">come to break our fall that we really</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.700" end="00:49:05.550" style="s2">are jumping off a cliff</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.030" end="00:49:07.230" style="s2">and I don&#39;t yeah I think it&#39;d convert it</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.550" end="00:49:08.940" style="s2">can very easily feel quite naive to say</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.230" end="00:49:10.740" style="s2">oh well yeah the blue churches die and</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.940" end="00:49:12.390" style="s2">then we&#39;ve got this kind of insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.740" end="00:49:14.190" style="s2">or this network solution on the other</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.390" end="00:49:16.440" style="s2">side it&#39;s like I&#39;m not seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.190" end="00:49:18.960" style="s2">Network solution and things seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.440" end="00:49:21.000" style="s2">falling apart very very quickly we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.960" end="00:49:24.330" style="s2">not gonna be caught by anything in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.000" end="00:49:27.900" style="s2">near term so that that&#39;s does that</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.330" end="00:49:34.040" style="s2">answer your your question yeah thanks a</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.900" end="00:49:36.120" style="s2">lot okay it&#39;s okay I do be the naive</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.040" end="00:49:38.430" style="s2">waiting for the thing to crash a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.120" end="00:49:39.990" style="s2">innit I do I tend to like bias my</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.430" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">thinking away from what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.990" end="00:49:45.570" style="s2">about so thanks a lot I think I like I</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:50.220" style="s2">am genuinely an optimist I think we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.570" end="00:49:54.360" style="s2">be okay but I think unless you really</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.220" end="00:49:57.030" style="s2">face up to what what that means like</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.360" end="00:49:59.730" style="s2">what I think we&#39;re just in so much</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.030" end="00:50:02.730" style="s2">danger of magical thinking and I see so</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.730" end="00:50:04.890" style="s2">much magical thinking in this space like</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.730" end="00:50:07.050" style="s2">can you face that full up can you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.890" end="00:50:08.940" style="s2">you look that full in the face can you</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.050" end="00:50:12.690" style="s2">look what that is likely to mean full in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:16.020" style="s2">the face and still keep the positivity</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.690" end="00:50:19.980" style="s2">and the optimism on the other side so</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.020" end="00:50:22.080" style="s2">Jamie wheel did an amazing talk which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.980" end="00:50:24.750" style="s2">on a maybe ask Peter to send it out</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.080" end="00:50:29.340" style="s2">afterwards call it was a it was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.750" end="00:50:32.390" style="s2">workshop we did called what was it sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.340" end="00:50:34.320" style="s2">making in an age of existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.390" end="00:50:36.390" style="s2">collective sense making an age of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.320" end="00:50:39.300" style="s2">existential risk where he just laid all</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.390" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">of that out beautifully and at the time</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.300" end="00:50:42.480" style="s2">when he gave it this was last year I</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:44.850" style="s2">thought wow Jamie&#39;s gone off the deep</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.480" end="00:50:46.140" style="s2">end he&#39;s way way more apocalyptic than</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.850" end="00:50:48.270" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever heard him I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.140" end="00:50:51.830" style="s2">agree with him now I kind of think oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.270" end="00:50:54.390" style="s2">yeah he was he was ahead of the curve he</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.830" end="00:50:58.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s the other thing as I&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.390" end="00:51:00.630" style="s2">of felt in this exploration like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.050" end="00:51:02.520" style="s2">held these two pieces like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.630" end="00:51:04.470" style="s2">Pederson and Steven Pinker of lower and</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.520" end="00:51:05.970" style="s2">the best time to ever be alive things</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.470" end="00:51:08.790" style="s2">are getting better and better and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.970" end="00:51:10.410" style="s2">also speaking to a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.790" end="00:51:11.880" style="s2">were talking about existential risk and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.410" end="00:51:13.740" style="s2">we&#39;re really kind of laying out a very</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.880" end="00:51:16.410" style="s2">different picture it&#39;s like can I hold</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.740" end="00:51:18.600" style="s2">both of these and I feel like I did in</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.410" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">the inquiry on the channel but as soon</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.600" end="00:51:22.830" style="s2">as the pandemic hit and it was just like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:23.670" style="s2">okay systemic cascade looks pretty</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.830" end="00:51:27.000" style="s2">obvious to me now</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.670" end="00:51:29.550" style="s2">okay now I&#39;m now I&#39;m collapsing into I</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.000" end="00:51:31.170" style="s2">think I think the ideas space of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.550" end="00:51:35.880" style="s2">possibilities his collapse quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.170" end="00:51:37.680" style="s2">radically in the last few months and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.880" end="00:51:40.230" style="s2">one of our zoom calls the other day with</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.680" end="00:51:42.200" style="s2">someone who was one of our one of our</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.230" end="00:51:44.700" style="s2">members she&#39;s in a Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.200" end="00:51:46.200" style="s2">discussion group and she said oh yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.700" end="00:51:49.260" style="s2">talked to them at rebel wisdom and they</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.200" end="00:51:51.600" style="s2">say oh wow they&#39;re so that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.260" end="00:51:52.920" style="s2">always saying how they&#39;re so left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.600" end="00:51:55.580" style="s2">and they&#39;re all saying how the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.920" end="00:51:58.350" style="s2">like really going to hell and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.580" end="00:52:03.420" style="s2">guys he looked outside recently</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.350" end="00:52:07.710" style="s2">I mean existential risk and systematic</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.420" end="00:52:10.050" style="s2">casket like that&#39;s not it surely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.710" end="00:52:11.910" style="s2">not a fringe position now like for a</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.050" end="00:52:14.130" style="s2">long time it was and I was actually I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.910" end="00:52:16.710" style="s2">never went down that rabbit hole as much</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.130" end="00:52:19.560" style="s2">as say I think Peters went down a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.710" end="00:52:21.900" style="s2">more and I know our mutual friend Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.560" end="00:52:23.970" style="s2">Thorson did a lot on his podcast and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.900" end="00:52:25.650" style="s2">felt that he was kind of following this</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.970" end="00:52:27.990" style="s2">thread of kind of existential risk and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.650" end="00:52:30.630" style="s2">was quite resistant to that I didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.990" end="00:52:33.990" style="s2">down that far but but now I&#39;m like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.630" end="00:52:35.400" style="s2">that&#39;s I&#39;m seeing it all play out like</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.990" end="00:52:37.470" style="s2">Daniel smacked and Berger talks about</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.400" end="00:52:39.720" style="s2">exponential tech on a finite playing</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.470" end="00:52:41.670" style="s2">field is self terminating and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.720" end="00:52:43.050" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying mostly in the kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.670" end="00:52:45.570" style="s2">focus is mostly on the information</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.050" end="00:52:47.580" style="s2">ecology because I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.570" end="00:52:49.940" style="s2">the the source of a lot of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.580" end="00:52:53.100" style="s2">seeing but it feels to me like</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.940" end="00:52:55.380" style="s2">weaponized information weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.100" end="00:52:57.300" style="s2">disinformation like the planned emic</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.380" end="00:52:59.460" style="s2">film being a perfect example of like</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.300" end="00:53:02.369" style="s2">something that&#39;s incredibly sticky it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.460" end="00:53:06.090" style="s2">incredibly compelling but it&#39;s playing</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.369" end="00:53:09.840" style="s2">the game a self-destructive game it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.090" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like its limbic hijack it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.840" end="00:53:16.440" style="s2">emotive language whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">true try and untie us as I said before</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.440" end="00:53:21.480" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to take out the whether or</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:23.790" style="s2">not these narratives are true and just</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.480" end="00:53:26.880" style="s2">look at what&#39;s happening to us from a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.790" end="00:53:27.599" style="s2">from a kind of meta perspective so I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.880" end="00:53:31.140" style="s2">a bit of a run</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.599" end="00:53:35.309" style="s2">but well thanks a lot oh I&#39;d love to ask</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.140" end="00:53:36.299" style="s2">more I&#39;m gonna let you go so we have it</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.309" end="00:53:38.849" style="s2">we should close out soon we have five</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.299" end="00:53:40.259" style="s2">minutes but I&#39;ll just maybe hand it back</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.849" end="00:53:42.359" style="s2">to you David is there anything you want</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.259" end="00:53:46.589" style="s2">you like I&#39;m curious where rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.359" end="00:53:48.869" style="s2">is going content wise try mine this this</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.589" end="00:53:52.019" style="s2">next video you want tease us a little</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.869" end="00:53:55.079" style="s2">bitter here no um well it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.019" end="00:53:57.809" style="s2">conspiracies again I&#39;m trying to look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.079" end="00:53:59.910" style="s2">the the it&#39;s a piece about spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.809" end="00:54:02.609" style="s2">and conspiracy right</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.910" end="00:54:08.489" style="s2">is this a new phenomenon that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.609" end="00:54:10.289" style="s2">seeing kind of post David Icke or sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.489" end="00:54:12.329" style="s2">post I think we&#39;re seeing a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.289" end="00:54:14.519" style="s2">phenomenon I think we&#39;re seeing like we</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.329" end="00:54:16.019" style="s2">all knew what the Infowars Alex Jones</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.519" end="00:54:19.400" style="s2">thing was I think we&#39;re seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.019" end="00:54:24.420" style="s2">new and it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s love</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.400" end="00:54:28.380" style="s2">consciousness awakening and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.420" end="00:54:32.099" style="s2">time this evil cult is out to kill us</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.380" end="00:54:33.660" style="s2">all and I think that&#39;s a new phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.099" end="00:54:38.119" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to do a film about that</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.660" end="00:54:40.619" style="s2">and people are not gonna like it but</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.119" end="00:54:42.660" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s what I&#39;m honestly seeing</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.619" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">and what I&#39;m trying to and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.660" end="00:54:49.349" style="s2">bringing in the concept of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:52.140" style="s2">spiritual like genuine spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.349" end="00:54:54.690" style="s2">awakening in that because I think people</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.140" end="00:54:57.869" style="s2">have a taste of questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.690" end="00:55:03.059" style="s2">mainstream narrative and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.869" end="00:55:05.309" style="s2">easily fall into over what&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.059" end="00:55:08.219" style="s2">like making sense too quickly on the</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.309" end="00:55:10.109" style="s2">other side of that and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.219" end="00:55:11.789" style="s2">trying to convey with that film it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.109" end="00:55:15.239" style="s2">like using the concept of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.789" end="00:55:18.469" style="s2">emergency the concept of genuine</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.239" end="00:55:21.269" style="s2">awakening how can we hold an open frame</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.469" end="00:55:24.089" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to kind of dismiss all</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.269" end="00:55:26.519" style="s2">of the conspiracy narratives because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.089" end="00:55:32.759" style="s2">yeah I believe some of them are are true</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.519" end="00:55:37.079" style="s2">there&#39;s but it&#39;s it&#39;s a secular religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.759" end="00:55:38.339" style="s2">and people are as touchy about it as</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.079" end="00:55:39.690" style="s2">people would be if you go into a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.339" end="00:55:41.360" style="s2">Christian convention and start</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.690" end="00:55:43.970" style="s2">criticizing Christianity so</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.360" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">and that in like that to it that in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.970" end="00:55:48.230" style="s2">itself is a fascinating phenomenon can</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:50.180" style="s2">we talk about how it&#39;s how it attracts</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.230" end="00:55:54.080" style="s2">levels of certainty that are religious</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.180" end="00:55:54.950" style="s2">in nature without triggering people no</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.080" end="00:55:56.650" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it without triggering</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.950" end="00:55:59.090" style="s2">people you will trigger people so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.650" end="00:56:01.340" style="s2">maybe I close down the comments I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.090" end="00:56:03.470" style="s2">know what that&#39;s gonna drum so people</p>

<p begin="00:56:08.510" end="00:56:12.530" style="s2">theory space and people from the blue</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.850" end="00:56:13.790" style="s2">church that criticize it I would love to</p>
