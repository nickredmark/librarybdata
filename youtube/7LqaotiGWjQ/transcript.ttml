<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:28.710" style="s2">your listeners that the things called</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.830" end="00:00:34.230" style="s2">news are mostly propaganda narrative</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.230" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">aren&#39;t good sources of sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.850" end="00:00:43.230" style="s2">we would hope though that there are some</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.230" end="00:00:49.110" style="s2">information like maybe scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:53.730" style="s2">journals like academia so science itself</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.110" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">I hoped this a long time ago ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.730" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">had the continuous kind of</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">disappointment you know I started being</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">like okay Kent I can&#39;t trust news to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:06.119" style="s2">true because news is narrative warfare I</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:07.950" style="s2">can&#39;t trust science without actually</p>

<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">to kind unfold to say where are the high</p>

<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">answer is really sad right I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">any sources that are very high signal</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:50.159" style="s2">requires understanding why the current</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:51.270" style="s2">information ecology is as broken as it</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.159" end="00:01:53.130" style="s2">is and we&#39;re starting to touch on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">couple things here but this goes deep</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.130" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">and how do we make good choices if we</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:01.140" style="s2">don&#39;t have good sense making well</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">obviously we can&#39;t but due to increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.140" end="00:02:04.740" style="s2">technological capacity right increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">population multiplied by increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.740" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">impact per person we&#39;re making more and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:12.340" style="s2">more consequential choices with worse</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.030" style="s2">and worse sense mate</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.340" end="00:02:18.310" style="s2">to inform those choices which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.030" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">running increasingly fast through the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.310" end="00:02:26.920" style="s2">woods increasingly blind right and so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:28.870" style="s2">think many of the people that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.920" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">on Robo wisdom have been in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.870" end="00:02:34.599" style="s2">inquiry around how do we actually fix</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:35.950" style="s2">our own sense making and it&#39;s some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.599" end="00:02:37.870" style="s2">what has brought us to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.950" end="00:02:40.180" style="s2">conversations with each other because a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.870" end="00:02:43.030" style="s2">part of how we work with our own sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.180" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">making as we recognize the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.030" end="00:02:48.130" style="s2">complexity of issues that the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:49.690" style="s2">faces is more than a single person can</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.130" end="00:02:51.220" style="s2">process a single brain that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.690" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">actually hold that cognitive complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.220" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">so it requires collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:58.090" style="s2">and collective sense making</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:03:01.209" style="s2">but I can&#39;t just offload the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.090" end="00:03:03.010" style="s2">complexity to some Authority because I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.209" end="00:03:04.660" style="s2">can&#39;t trust that they&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:05.739" style="s2">good sense making maybe they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.660" end="00:03:08.110" style="s2">good sense making within a very limited</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.739" end="00:03:09.970" style="s2">context but then the application of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.110" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">outside of the context is different and</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.970" end="00:03:12.940" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s even distortions within</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">their context so I have to try and find</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.940" end="00:03:15.700" style="s2">other people that are also really</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:17.670" style="s2">endeavoring to sense make well which</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.700" end="00:03:20.350" style="s2">means they have to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.670" end="00:03:21.489" style="s2">causes failures and sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.350" end="00:03:22.870" style="s2">then we have to see can we create</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.489" end="00:03:25.390" style="s2">relationships with each other that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.870" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">removed the distortion basis that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.390" end="00:03:34.959" style="s2">normally there so I think I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:37.540" style="s2">from what I have seen of rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.959" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">this is probably the strange attractor</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.540" end="00:03:41.109" style="s2">of what is bringing everybody to watch</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:42.549" style="s2">it is people who are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.109" end="00:03:45.790" style="s2">sense of the world better themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.549" end="00:03:47.980" style="s2">are trying to find sources of content of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.790" end="00:03:50.859" style="s2">other other people that have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.980" end="00:03:53.290" style="s2">to make sense of it well which is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.859" end="00:03:54.970" style="s2">I&#39;m excited about and so those are just</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.290" end="00:03:59.799" style="s2">some opening thoughts and yeah I look</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.970" end="00:04:01.569" style="s2">forward to getting into why we have as</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.799" end="00:04:04.389" style="s2">broken and information ecology as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.569" end="00:04:08.200" style="s2">have and what it would take to correct</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.389" end="00:04:09.850" style="s2">that at a at scale and how we can make</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.200" end="00:04:11.560" style="s2">sense of the world even in the broken</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.850" end="00:04:13.480" style="s2">information ecology now in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.560" end="00:04:16.970" style="s2">practical process</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.480" end="00:04:19.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve never actually shared publicly</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.970" end="00:04:27.169" style="s2">these types of frameworks before so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.670" end="00:04:34.040" style="s2">feels fun and exciting and I hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.169" end="00:04:36.530" style="s2">useful as I&#39;ve been trying to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.040" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">of the world making sense of why since</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.530" end="00:04:42.490" style="s2">making it so hard is pretty central</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a famous quote I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.030" end="00:04:52.640" style="s2">attributed to Einstein make things as</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:54.950" style="s2">simple as possible but not simpler as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.640" end="00:04:58.040" style="s2">simple as possible really the goal isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.950" end="00:05:00.410" style="s2">is as clear as possible right but</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.040" end="00:05:06.620" style="s2">simpler would mean it&#39;s wrong like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.410" end="00:05:08.150" style="s2">not accurate anymore if I&#39;m you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.620" end="00:05:10.190" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to face this doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.150" end="00:05:12.470" style="s2">media work there will be pressures on</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.190" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">you to say hey people can&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.470" end="00:05:15.800" style="s2">attention more than sound bytes you got</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">to make it five minute chunks so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.800" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">word size is too big make it for an</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:21.200" style="s2">eighth grade level right which is saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.169" style="s2">people are dumb</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.200" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">so spoon feed them stuff that dumb</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.169" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">people can handle which to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">you do that and it&#39;s successful will</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:34.030" style="s2">keep people dumb but that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.340" end="00:05:37.220" style="s2">what like those are the pressures in in</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.030" end="00:05:40.970" style="s2">anyone doing broadcast even for a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.220" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">hopefully good intention right and if we</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.970" end="00:05:47.930" style="s2">want people to actually be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">sense of the world well you can&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.930" end="00:05:54.350" style="s2">in very short periods of time with lots</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:57.320" style="s2">of distraction and oversimplified like</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.350" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">if you if you look at anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.320" end="00:06:01.190" style="s2">actually increased the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:03.260" style="s2">capacity of the world you look at any</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.260" end="00:06:09.860" style="s2">it in tweets and they didn&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.890" end="00:06:13.510" style="s2">radically distracted and they didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:17.840" style="s2">it in a dumb down process right like I</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.510" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">have I have so many people who have</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.840" end="00:06:24.330" style="s2">written to me saying like we want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:26.370" style="s2">create a new kind of Education</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.330" end="00:06:31.560" style="s2">young people we want to create a new</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.370" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">kind of education that makes everybody</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.560" end="00:06:36.750" style="s2">like Bucky fuller or Leonardo sits</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:37.949" style="s2">conditions polymaths and they say this</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.750" end="00:06:42.060" style="s2">because I&#39;ve written some stuff on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.949" end="00:06:44.509" style="s2">topic and that they have some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.060" end="00:06:50.909" style="s2">they could lead that and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.509" end="00:06:54.930" style="s2">have you read Bucky&#39;s books like well no</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.909" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">we mostly don&#39;t read books and have you</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.930" end="00:06:58.379" style="s2">read the references in Bucky&#39;s books</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.300" style="s2">just see the amount of shit that he read</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.379" end="00:07:03.210" style="s2">and referenced to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.300" end="00:07:05.699" style="s2">well and so there&#39;s a there there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.210" end="00:07:07.229" style="s2">decoupling of the sense of the agency</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.699" end="00:07:09.240" style="s2">possible with what it takes to do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.229" end="00:07:12.449" style="s2">it&#39;s you know like that there&#39;s a saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.240" end="00:07:14.129" style="s2">everywhere in almost all domains to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.449" end="00:07:15.539" style="s2">effect of like everybody wants to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.129" end="00:07:17.430" style="s2">buff but nobody wants to lift heavy ass</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.539" end="00:07:18.780" style="s2">weights or everybody wants to win and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.430" end="00:07:22.879" style="s2">nobody wants to work harder there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.780" end="00:07:22.879" style="s2">something like that that happens here is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:29.150" style="s2">if I want to be able to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.849" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">the world well I have to work at that</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.150" end="00:07:33.690" style="s2">and if I want to be able to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.610" style="s2">of the world better that the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.690" end="00:07:42.090" style="s2">better than I currently do like</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.610" end="00:07:43.699" style="s2">attention requires being trained just</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.090" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">like muscles require being trained</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.699" end="00:07:50.159" style="s2">thinking clearly requires being trained</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:51.750" style="s2">and anytime there&#39;s a hormetic process</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.159" end="00:07:53.550" style="s2">you know hormesis is the principle by</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.750" end="00:07:55.979" style="s2">which you stress an adaptive system to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.550" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">increase its adaptive capacity so I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.979" end="00:07:59.340" style="s2">to stress a muscle to get the muscle to</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:02.150" style="s2">grow if I&#39;m lifting an amount of weight</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.340" end="00:08:04.440" style="s2">that&#39;s super easy the muscle there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.150" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">input that says the muscle needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.440" end="00:08:07.379" style="s2">bigger and there&#39;s a cost to getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:09.060" style="s2">bigger right so it&#39;s only gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.379" end="00:08:11.370" style="s2">through that cost if it&#39;s being stressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.060" end="00:08:13.289" style="s2">and the same is true like if I expose</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.370" end="00:08:14.969" style="s2">myself to more heat and more cold than</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.289" end="00:08:16.740" style="s2">as comfortable actually gain greater</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.969" end="00:08:18.150" style="s2">metabolic flexibility to deal with heat</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.740" end="00:08:19.770" style="s2">and cold which means that if I stay in</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.150" end="00:08:20.759" style="s2">an environment where I always have</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.770" end="00:08:22.740" style="s2">heating and air conditioning I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.759" end="00:08:24.330" style="s2">actually lose metabolic flexibility you</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.740" end="00:08:25.979" style="s2">have to stress the system to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:27.180" style="s2">grow the system and in a particular kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.979" end="00:08:28.680" style="s2">of way and not all stressors are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.180" end="00:08:31.949" style="s2">grow the system but this is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.680" end="00:08:34.680" style="s2">true cognitively which means if I keep</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.949" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">paying attention to hyper normal stimuli</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.680" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.920" end="00:08:45.280" style="s2">moving quickly so I get the stimuli of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.930" end="00:08:48.250" style="s2">lots of novelty I&#39;m gonna be decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.280" end="00:08:50.260" style="s2">my attention but if I want to have any</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.250" end="00:08:52.330" style="s2">kind of nuanced view I have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.260" end="00:08:55.510" style="s2">to hold multiple partial views in</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.330" end="00:08:57.100" style="s2">working memory it&#39;s not that some people</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.510" end="00:08:59.170" style="s2">have good memory or good attention and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.100" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">other people don&#39;t intrinsically it any</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.170" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">more than some people are buff and some</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">aren&#39;t intrinsically it&#39;s developable</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">but it has to actually be developed so</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.980" end="00:09:12.220" style="s2">so the impulse to say hey make it really</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.540" end="00:09:13.780" style="s2">simple so everybody can get it and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.220" end="00:09:15.430" style="s2">impulse to say help people actually make</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.780" end="00:09:19.260" style="s2">sense of the world well or are different</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.430" end="00:09:21.550" style="s2">things now some people will make stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.260" end="00:09:24.610" style="s2">technical seeming intentionally to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.550" end="00:09:26.980" style="s2">obscure it as a power game right so that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.610" end="00:09:29.560" style="s2">to encourage others to defer their sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.980" end="00:09:30.370" style="s2">making to them I understand this complex</p>

<p begin="00:09:30.370" end="00:09:38.710" style="s2">understand this or defer Authority to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.480" end="00:09:41.800" style="s2">we will we want to do something if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.710" end="00:09:43.780" style="s2">actually want to empower people I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.800" end="00:09:47.170" style="s2">want them to defer their sense-making to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.780" end="00:09:49.390" style="s2">me but I also don&#39;t want them to do lazy</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.170" end="00:09:51.460" style="s2">shitty sense-making or defer it to</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.390" end="00:09:53.140" style="s2">anyone else which means I want them to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.460" end="00:09:55.540" style="s2">grow the quality of their own sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.140" end="00:09:58.600" style="s2">making which means to grow the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.540" end="00:10:00.040" style="s2">their care right anti nihilism to grow</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.600" end="00:10:02.220" style="s2">the depth of their care to grow the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.040" end="00:10:04.210" style="s2">depth of their earnestness their own</p>

<p begin="00:10:08.080" end="00:10:11.470" style="s2">capacity want them to grow their</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:12.970" style="s2">attention span and both the clarity of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.470" end="00:10:14.560" style="s2">their logic and the clarity of their</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.970" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">intuition and the noticing when</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.560" end="00:10:17.620" style="s2">something&#39;s coming from intuition or</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:19.180" style="s2">logic and how to relate those like all</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.620" end="00:10:25.060" style="s2">of those things but that&#39;s actually what</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.180" end="00:10:26.530" style="s2">increasing sovereignty means so</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.060" end="00:10:28.360" style="s2">information apology is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.530" end="00:10:30.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole ecosystem of information</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.360" end="00:10:31.960" style="s2">right like we have information coming in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.100" end="00:10:33.640" style="s2">from marketing information coming in</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.960" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">from government sources from campaigning</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.640" end="00:10:38.770" style="s2">from just what our neighbors tell us and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">our friends tell us from social media</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.770" end="00:10:44.290" style="s2">from like and we use information to make</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:46.810" style="s2">sense of the world to make choices that</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.290" end="00:10:49.000" style="s2">are aligned with whatever our goals are</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.810" end="00:10:49.570" style="s2">and our values and what&#39;s meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.000" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.570" end="00:10:57.509" style="s2">and what we hope is that the information</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:59.829" style="s2">around us is mostly true and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.509" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">representative of reality so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.829" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">use that to make choices that will be</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:05.980" style="s2">effective when I say broken information</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.779" style="s2">ecology it means that we can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.980" end="00:11:09.790" style="s2">that most of the information coming in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.779" end="00:11:11.529" style="s2">is true and representative of reality</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.790" end="00:11:13.120" style="s2">and will inform good choice making and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.529" end="00:11:14.889" style="s2">so then this is where we have to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.120" end="00:11:18.940" style="s2">into ok so where does information come</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.889" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">from right signals are being shared by</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.940" end="00:11:24.490" style="s2">people and by groups of people that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:26.350" style="s2">shared agency like corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.490" end="00:11:32.949" style="s2">governments and political parties and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.350" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">religions and whatever right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.949" end="00:11:37.420" style="s2">want to start getting into why do people</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:39.970" style="s2">share information other than just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.420" end="00:11:43.690" style="s2">sharing what is true and representative</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.970" end="00:11:49.509" style="s2">of reality this is actually a really key</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.690" end="00:11:51.459" style="s2">thing to start to understand so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.509" end="00:11:53.500" style="s2">I&#39;ll actually define something that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.459" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">was just referencing which is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.500" end="00:11:58.389" style="s2">difference between true and truthful</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:00.940" style="s2">it&#39;s a first important distinction when</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.389" end="00:12:04.060" style="s2">we say someone&#39;s being truthful what we</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.940" end="00:12:06.010" style="s2">mean is that what they if you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.060" end="00:12:08.550" style="s2">truthful with me it means that what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.010" end="00:12:10.750" style="s2">are sharing maps to what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.550" end="00:12:12.610" style="s2">right that there&#39;s a correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.750" end="00:12:14.920" style="s2">between the signal that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.610" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">communicating to me and what you believe</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.920" end="00:12:21.480" style="s2">is true so we can look at breakdowns of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:23.470" style="s2">truthfulness which is where people are</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.480" end="00:12:25.240" style="s2">distorting information with some</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.470" end="00:12:28.389" style="s2">intentionality and that can either be</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.240" end="00:12:31.439" style="s2">through overt lying or through lying</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.389" end="00:12:34.269" style="s2">through omission or lying through</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.439" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">emphasis bias right those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.269" end="00:12:39.939" style="s2">things so that&#39;s truthful and when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">say something is true what we typically</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.939" end="00:12:44.680" style="s2">mean and this is actually this gets very</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">nuanced and we end up having to get into</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.680" end="00:12:49.480" style="s2">like fundamental epistemology ontology</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:50.589" style="s2">concepts of what does it mean for</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.480" end="00:12:52.509" style="s2">something to be true what are our</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.589" end="00:12:55.389" style="s2">fundamental axioms about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.509" end="00:12:57.610" style="s2">reality I&#39;ll put that on hold for now</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.389" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">and just say in general if we say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.610" end="00:13:00.310" style="s2">someone&#39;s saying something that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">we don&#39;t just mean that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.310" end="00:13:03.740" style="s2">correspondence between what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.810" end="00:13:04.790" style="s2">saying and what they think but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.740" end="00:13:06.410" style="s2">corresponds between what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.790" end="00:13:11.450" style="s2">and some independently verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.410" end="00:13:13.460" style="s2">reality and so of course someone can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.450" end="00:13:14.780" style="s2">truthful meaning they say what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.460" end="00:13:15.980" style="s2">believe but what they believe is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.780" end="00:13:17.240" style="s2">misinformed because they did</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.980" end="00:13:20.180" style="s2">sense-making poorly so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.240" end="00:13:26.360" style="s2">propagating information honestly but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.180" end="00:13:29.870" style="s2">that is not true and so we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.360" end="00:13:31.790" style="s2">at distortions in both of these there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.870" end="00:13:34.820" style="s2">a third thing which is representative</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.790" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">which is it&#39;s possible for someone to be</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.120" end="00:13:50.060" style="s2">saying maps to reality and in some clear</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.790" end="00:13:53.020" style="s2">way and yet the interpretation I get</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.060" end="00:13:56.810" style="s2">from that will still actually mislead me</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.020" end="00:14:00.290" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the true information is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.810" end="00:14:03.560" style="s2">not representative of the entire context</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.290" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">well articles published and famous</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:08.930" style="s2">journals like Journal of American</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.930" end="00:14:12.200" style="s2">we&#39;ll see that a major percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.820" end="00:14:15.380" style="s2">them something like fifty percent are</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.200" end="00:14:18.350" style="s2">found to be mostly inaccurate fifty</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.380" end="00:14:21.860" style="s2">percent is a coin toss right or we see</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.350" end="00:14:24.920" style="s2">the replication crisis or we see that</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.860" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">the things that get studied even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.920" end="00:14:29.270" style="s2">true information it can be misleading</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:31.010" style="s2">because for the most part where does the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.270" end="00:14:33.710" style="s2">money to fund the research come from</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.010" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna come within capitalism mostly</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.710" end="00:14:37.520" style="s2">where there&#39;s some ROI on the research</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.870" style="s2">and so some areas have moral ROI than</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.520" end="00:14:40.700" style="s2">others so even a bunch of true</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.870" end="00:14:42.280" style="s2">information but that is weighted towards</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.280" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">over others create misrepresentation</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:51.110" style="s2">right so even a bunch of true</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.920" end="00:14:54.020" style="s2">information can create distortion so</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.110" end="00:14:56.270" style="s2">then you start to say oh okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.020" end="00:14:57.740" style="s2">essence of science within the philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.270" end="00:14:59.870" style="s2">of science the essence of it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.740" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">earnestness of inquiry right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.870" end="00:15:05.510" style="s2">empiricism but then earnestness of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:07.220" style="s2">inquiry eddington defined science as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.510" end="00:15:10.820" style="s2">earnest endeavor to put into order the</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.220" end="00:15:14.330" style="s2">facts of experience and the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.820" end="00:15:16.380" style="s2">capitalism is see you can say the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.330" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">essence of science is no bias</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.380" end="00:15:20.370" style="s2">right at least the idea the spirit of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:21.720" style="s2">we can get into where even the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.370" end="00:15:26.490" style="s2">philosophy of science has built an</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.720" end="00:15:28.620" style="s2">axiomatic bias later but then the in</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.490" end="00:15:30.540" style="s2">capitalism it is about optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.620" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">bias right like I actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.540" end="00:15:34.620" style="s2">agency that I&#39;m trying to get ahead I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:39.720" style="s2">have intention to increase my balance</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.620" end="00:15:41.460" style="s2">sheet and so if there is capital funding</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.720" end="00:15:43.320" style="s2">of science it&#39;s going to fund the things</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.460" end="00:15:44.550" style="s2">that create ROI on that research so we</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.320" end="00:15:46.380" style="s2">can keep doing more research that</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.550" end="00:15:50.310" style="s2">creates both a reason to distort the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.380" end="00:15:52.110" style="s2">info and the reason to withhold</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.310" end="00:15:54.390" style="s2">information that is a source of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.110" end="00:15:57.480" style="s2">competitive advantage a reason to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.390" end="00:15:59.940" style="s2">this info to other competitors and to at</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.480" end="00:16:02.760" style="s2">least wait you know of course in biotech</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.940" end="00:16:04.770" style="s2">if I can get a patent on a synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.760" end="00:16:06.690" style="s2">molecule and I can&#39;t get a patent on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.770" end="00:16:08.400" style="s2">natural molecule does a lot more money</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.690" end="00:16:09.930" style="s2">is gonna go into synthetic molecules in</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.400" end="00:16:11.040" style="s2">natural and then we look it and say well</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.930" end="00:16:12.900" style="s2">there&#39;s not that many phase 3 clinical</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:14.880" style="s2">trials on herbs and there are on Pharma</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.900" end="00:16:17.490" style="s2">meds so the pharma meds must be more</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.880" end="00:16:20.100" style="s2">accurate no this is a even true</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.490" end="00:16:21.930" style="s2">information preponderance of data is</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.100" end="00:16:23.640" style="s2">going to create problems right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.930" end="00:16:25.230" style="s2">that&#39;s actually true information that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.640" end="00:16:26.690" style="s2">being shared truthfully that would still</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.230" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">be misrepresentative of</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.690" end="00:16:30.990" style="s2">reality so this is where I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:33.270" style="s2">do I have some sense of what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.990" end="00:16:35.280" style="s2">territory is and do I have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.270" end="00:16:37.910" style="s2">the map that&#39;s being created actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.280" end="00:16:41.160" style="s2">maps onto the territory reasonably well</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.910" end="00:16:43.260" style="s2">because sense making means map</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.160" end="00:16:45.330" style="s2">generation right to be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.260" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">choices of how we navigate how we do</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.330" end="00:16:52.140" style="s2">choice making in relationships with some</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:54.030" style="s2">actual territory so that&#39;s true truthful</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.140" end="00:16:59.280" style="s2">and then representative and we can look</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.030" end="00:17:00.900" style="s2">at distortions and all three of those so</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.280" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">when we look at white as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.900" end="00:17:09.680" style="s2">distort information the the most</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:09.680" style="s2">fundamental way of thinking about it is</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:15.960" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea in terms of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.190" end="00:17:17.910" style="s2">like if I&#39;m just nature watching and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.960" end="00:17:19.940" style="s2">watching what is happening with rabbits</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.910" end="00:17:21.810" style="s2">and trees and birds I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.940" end="00:17:22.910" style="s2">information about them that they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.810" end="00:17:25.850" style="s2">even intending</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.910" end="00:17:27.380" style="s2">to transmit and so the information is</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.850" end="00:17:29.480" style="s2">just reflective right lights actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.380" end="00:17:32.299" style="s2">reflecting off of them of the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.480" end="00:17:35.990" style="s2">reality as soon as there&#39;s an agent that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.299" end="00:17:38.480" style="s2">can share information strategically for</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:40.700" style="s2">an intention then I don&#39;t know if what</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.480" end="00:17:42.440" style="s2">they&#39;re sharing is reflective of reality</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.700" end="00:17:44.690" style="s2">or reflective of what they think will</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.440" end="00:17:46.220" style="s2">advance their intention and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.690" end="00:17:48.380" style="s2">of the key distinction is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.220" end="00:17:50.090" style="s2">moment we get abstract signaling which</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.380" end="00:17:52.280" style="s2">language allows us and the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.090" end="00:17:56.030" style="s2">kind of forecast in our ability to model</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.280" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">each other and your well-being and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.030" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">basis of your agency doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:02.090" style="s2">coupled with my well-being in the basis</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:04.789" style="s2">of my agency perfectly in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.090" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">the partner wanting to cheat and get</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.789" end="00:18:08.659" style="s2">away with it right there&#39;s a decoupling</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:12.230" style="s2">of well being an agency in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.659" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">if I&#39;m a marketer of a product and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.230" end="00:18:16.610" style="s2">want you to purchase it</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:18.980" style="s2">whether my product is actually the best</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.610" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">product or not whether a competitor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.980" end="00:18:22.820" style="s2">product is better whether you need the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:23.960" style="s2">product or not I want you to think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.820" end="00:18:25.130" style="s2">you need it and to think that mine is</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.960" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">the best right so there&#39;s a breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.130" end="00:18:29.690" style="s2">between what seems to be in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">well-being and what seems to be in your</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.690" end="00:18:38.929" style="s2">well-being so wherever there is a any</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.230" end="00:18:41.390" style="s2">misalignment in agency and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.929" end="00:18:44.120" style="s2">ability to share signal for strategic</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.390" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">purposes then you have a basis to have</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.120" end="00:18:49.400" style="s2">signal that&#39;s being shared that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">just truthful right so then we look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.400" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">where is that happening and it&#39;s fucking</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.200" end="00:18:56.030" style="s2">everywhere right to really gross or</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:59.780" style="s2">subtle degrees pretty much everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.030" end="00:19:02.990" style="s2">and sometimes for dreadful purposes like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.780" end="00:19:05.330" style="s2">I mean you got the prosaic purposes</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.990" end="00:19:08.150" style="s2">which are basically market type dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.330" end="00:19:09.799" style="s2">which most of the dynamics in the world</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.150" end="00:19:12.130" style="s2">or market dynamics or at least</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.799" end="00:19:15.980" style="s2">influenced by market dynamics right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.130" end="00:19:18.850" style="s2">market dynamics are fundamentally at</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.980" end="00:19:21.350" style="s2">least partially if not mostly rivalries</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.850" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">meaning my balance she can get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.350" end="00:19:24.230" style="s2">independent of your balance she getting</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:29.990" style="s2">ahead and definitely independent of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.230" end="00:19:32.419" style="s2">Commons right and so in a market type</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.990" end="00:19:34.610" style="s2">dynamic I&#39;m going to be sharing</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.419" end="00:19:38.840" style="s2">information and this is why buyer beware</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.610" end="00:19:40.429" style="s2">but as soon buyer beware is not just you</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.840" end="00:19:42.200" style="s2">know check to make sure that the car</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.429" end="00:19:43.669" style="s2">isn&#39;t about to break down it&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:19:43.669" end="00:19:47.630" style="s2">shared is being true because if I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:19:47.630" end="00:19:52.039" style="s2">service right and you&#39;re purchasing that</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.929" end="00:21:42.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a form of kind of narrative warfare</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.789" end="00:21:45.020" style="s2">because that we&#39;re agents that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.980" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">actually competing for what you do are</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.020" end="00:21:48.440" style="s2">you I want you to do something in</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.290" style="s2">particular you want to do it</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.440" end="00:21:52.700" style="s2">for you those aren&#39;t the same thing but</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.290" end="00:21:57.470" style="s2">it&#39;s actually an asymmetric warfare</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.700" end="00:21:59.330" style="s2">because I have a lot more ongoing team</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.470" end="00:22:00.920" style="s2">and focus now especially as you start to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.330" end="00:22:04.490" style="s2">look at a big corporation empowered by</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.920" end="00:22:06.980" style="s2">AI and Big Data and etc it&#39;s radically</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.490" end="00:22:07.910" style="s2">asymmetric info warfare that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.980" end="00:22:09.410" style="s2">even know it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.910" end="00:22:14.420" style="s2">right you don&#39;t even know you&#39;re engaged</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.410" end="00:22:15.830" style="s2">in so we can see that and but all the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.420" end="00:22:19.330" style="s2">way down to the little guy in in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.830" end="00:22:22.310" style="s2">market right who&#39;s just peddling where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.330" end="00:22:24.470" style="s2">his incentive is to compel people to buy</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.310" end="00:22:26.120" style="s2">the thing not to really adequately</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.470" end="00:22:27.620" style="s2">inform them that he just marked the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.120" end="00:22:29.030" style="s2">price up a lot from where he got it down</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.620" end="00:22:30.350" style="s2">the way and if they go down the way off</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.030" end="00:22:35.300" style="s2">the beaten path like the other stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.350" end="00:22:44.440" style="s2">better and so this is Rubik wa tiss</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.300" end="00:22:46.880" style="s2">right okay and then as we&#39;re exploring</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.440" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">reasons that people share things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.880" end="00:22:53.780" style="s2">are not fully truthful and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:54.620" style="s2">representative there of course things</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.780" end="00:22:56.210" style="s2">worse than this</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.620" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">this is I would say most of where the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.210" end="00:23:01.640" style="s2">distortion comes from is agency</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:04.100" style="s2">misalignment well it&#39;s always agency</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.640" end="00:23:08.510" style="s2">misalignment right mostly we&#39;ll call</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.100" end="00:23:11.990" style="s2">that market but any sources where you</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.510" end="00:23:14.690" style="s2">have some agent whether it&#39;s a come a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.990" end="00:23:15.940" style="s2">company or a country or a person that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.690" end="00:23:17.660" style="s2">can think about their own well-being</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.940" end="00:23:20.450" style="s2">independent of the well-being of other</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.660" end="00:23:22.040" style="s2">agents and/or the Commons then there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.450" end="00:23:24.290" style="s2">a basis for them to optimize their</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.040" end="00:23:25.910" style="s2">well-being at with some externality in</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.290" end="00:23:27.620" style="s2">the same way we externalize cost to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.910" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">environment we X connects turn Eliza</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.620" end="00:23:31.460" style="s2">cost to the information environment in</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.460" end="00:23:35.980" style="s2">environment is like disinformation is</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.980" end="00:23:42.170" style="s2">right that&#39;s a kind of a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.090" end="00:23:44.630" style="s2">thinking about it and as ubiquity Bic</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.170" end="00:23:45.920" style="s2">witness as pollution is where we see</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.630" end="00:23:47.900" style="s2">that the snow on the top of Mount</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.920" end="00:23:50.420" style="s2">Everest is full of pollution right of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.900" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">many different kinds I would say</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.420" end="00:23:55.820" style="s2">information ecology pollution is more</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">Rubik witness because it&#39;s not just big</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.820" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">industrial players doing it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">everybody doing it and you can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:01.900" style="s2">see it as clearly</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.780" end="00:24:09.060" style="s2">but even people will create distortions</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.170" end="00:24:12.450" style="s2">and information for seemingly positive</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.060" end="00:24:14.130" style="s2">reasons like first there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.450" end="00:24:16.260" style="s2">innocuous reasons like okay I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.130" end="00:24:18.750" style="s2">write a testimonial or an endorsement</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.260" end="00:24:21.420" style="s2">for my friend&#39;s book because they&#39;re my</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.750" end="00:24:23.130" style="s2">friend even though I think there&#39;s stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.420" end="00:24:25.530" style="s2">wrong in their book it wouldn&#39;t be that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.130" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">gracious of me to say that and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.530" end="00:24:28.650" style="s2">there&#39;s some game theoretic stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:30.090" style="s2">there like they wrote a nice testimonial</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.650" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">for my book and I want them to keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.090" end="00:24:35.280" style="s2">doing that and so my giving the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:36.930" style="s2">endorsement of my whatever credibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.280" end="00:24:40.740" style="s2">that other people proxy their sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.930" end="00:24:43.140" style="s2">making to me I&#39;m now you know proxying</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.740" end="00:24:45.810" style="s2">that credibility over here is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.140" end="00:24:47.130" style="s2">necessarily true even if it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.810" end="00:24:49.650" style="s2">they did the endorsement on my book and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.130" end="00:24:51.510" style="s2">I just am supportive of them taking a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.650" end="00:24:53.160" style="s2">positive step that doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.510" end="00:24:55.290" style="s2">mean that anyone else who sees that I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.160" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">offered that testimonial and is using</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.290" end="00:24:59.580" style="s2">that as a method of their own sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:01.710" style="s2">making knows why I did it so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.580" end="00:25:03.180" style="s2">other thing as a decoupling of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.710" end="00:25:07.410" style="s2">signal that I&#39;m sharing with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.180" end="00:25:09.630" style="s2">intention that I&#39;m sharing it for and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.410" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">I might be sharing something with you</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.630" end="00:25:14.340" style="s2">and I have four or five complex</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.340" end="00:25:25.080" style="s2">with you or maybe I shared one when</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.370" end="00:25:26.610" style="s2">you&#39;re getting information from a news</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.080" end="00:25:29.070" style="s2">channel and you&#39;re like oh this news</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.610" end="00:25:31.230" style="s2">channel wants to maximize my time on</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.070" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">site and it can do that through</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.230" end="00:25:35.610" style="s2">appealing to my cognitive biases and my</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.770" style="s2">emotional biases and my identity biases</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.610" end="00:25:39.930" style="s2">it can do that through things that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.770" end="00:25:41.460" style="s2">inflammatory it can do that through all</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.930" end="00:25:43.350" style="s2">kinds of things that are hyper normal</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.460" end="00:25:45.420" style="s2">stimulus and that hijack my attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.350" end="00:25:47.130" style="s2">this is where it&#39;s competing for my</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.420" end="00:25:49.050" style="s2">attention against where I would want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.130" end="00:25:54.510" style="s2">put my attention because it&#39;s monetizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.050" end="00:25:56.670" style="s2">my attention right so I have to factor</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.510" end="00:26:00.150" style="s2">the agency the intention of the news</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.670" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">station and try and remove that artifact</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.150" end="00:26:05.210" style="s2">from the information to try and infer</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:07.830" style="s2">what the true information might be</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.210" end="00:26:09.540" style="s2">basically to infer what the source of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.830" end="00:26:11.100" style="s2">distortion might be the same of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:13.720" end="00:26:21.570" style="s2">okay so who&#39;s who is seeking more grant</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.520" end="00:27:00.010" style="s2">just another way to say intentional on</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.170" end="00:27:03.010" style="s2">the part of the agent sharing it for</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.910" end="00:27:34.600" style="s2">to look at why is anyone sharing what</p>

<p begin="00:27:39.720" end="00:27:46.030" style="s2">so basically truthful is about game</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.000" end="00:27:47.470" style="s2">theory right truthful is about the fact</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.340" end="00:28:01.149" style="s2">okay we&#39;re actually gonna say a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.210" end="00:28:02.860" style="s2">bit more about that one formula when</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.149" end="00:28:03.340" style="s2">you&#39;re playing poker you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.860" end="00:28:06.610" style="s2">bluff</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.340" end="00:28:09.130" style="s2">because it it&#39;s not who has the best</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.130" end="00:28:12.700" style="s2">else think that they have the best hand</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.019" end="00:28:16.149" style="s2">and right there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.700" end="00:28:19.149" style="s2">goes on than that and so because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.149" end="00:28:20.950" style="s2">zero-sum game right that if my win does</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.149" end="00:28:25.710" style="s2">not equal your win my win is going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.950" end="00:28:28.630" style="s2">equal some other players losses then I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.710" end="00:28:31.299" style="s2">have an incentive to dis inform you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.630" end="00:28:34.929" style="s2">where information about reality is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.299" end="00:28:36.309" style="s2">source of competitive advantage this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.929" end="00:28:37.419" style="s2">actually the real kind of key way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.309" end="00:28:38.889" style="s2">thinking about because disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.419" end="00:28:41.289" style="s2">even happens in nature with other</p>

<p begin="00:28:41.289" end="00:28:45.130" style="s2">evolved to have something on its tail</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.240" end="00:28:46.630" style="s2">that looks like a head to dis inform</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.130" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">birds so that they go to pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.630" end="00:28:49.870" style="s2">false head and it might still be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:53.610" style="s2">live right like that&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.870" end="00:28:56.260" style="s2">involved disinformation strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.610" end="00:28:58.510" style="s2">it&#39;s just that the disinformation in</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.260" end="00:29:00.070" style="s2">nature happens very slowly and where the</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.510" end="00:29:01.899" style="s2">selective pressures on the side of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.070" end="00:29:03.789" style="s2">caterpillar and the bird or coevolving</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.899" end="00:29:05.470" style="s2">right so the bird is getting better at</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.789" end="00:29:06.669" style="s2">noticing those things as the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.470" end="00:29:08.500" style="s2">is getting better at dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.669" end="00:29:10.809" style="s2">camouflage is a kind of disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.500" end="00:29:12.580" style="s2">right it&#39;s an attempt to not signal</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.809" end="00:29:16.570" style="s2">something fully because there&#39;s rival</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.580" end="00:29:20.500" style="s2">risk dynamics between the caterpillar</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.570" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">and the bird in that scenario but with</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.500" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">people with our abstract replicators we</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:27.850" style="s2">can create the distortion much much much</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:29.559" style="s2">faster we can have a symmetries in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.850" end="00:29:33.429" style="s2">capacity to create the distortion and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.559" end="00:29:41.320" style="s2">even exponential asymmetries and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.429" end="00:29:43.480" style="s2">actually really quite different so you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.320" end="00:29:45.100" style="s2">think about the poker bluff and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.480" end="00:29:46.809" style="s2">think about like even in soccer or</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.100" end="00:29:48.130" style="s2">football when someone fakes left and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.809" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">then goes right that&#39;s a disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.130" end="00:29:53.909" style="s2">strategy where if we&#39;re competing in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">information about the nature of reality</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.909" end="00:29:59.019" style="s2">where the water is where the gold is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:00.340" style="s2">what the market is going to do next if</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.019" end="00:30:02.889" style="s2">this company is going to make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.340" end="00:30:04.840" style="s2">whatever equals a source of advantage</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.889" end="00:30:05.980" style="s2">but we&#39;re an assumed rival risk dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.840" end="00:30:07.090" style="s2">we&#39;re competing for the same money</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.980" end="00:30:09.580" style="s2">competing for the same attention</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.090" end="00:30:11.730" style="s2">whatever then first I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.580" end="00:30:14.950" style="s2">the incentive to withhold information</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.730" end="00:30:17.440" style="s2">right so I don&#39;t want to tell you where</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.950" end="00:30:19.600" style="s2">the gold is or I don&#39;t want you to know</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.440" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">the intellectual property that I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.600" end="00:30:25.059" style="s2">to monetize simply the withholding of</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:26.649" style="s2">information fuck&#39;s up the information</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.059" end="00:30:29.440" style="s2">ecology so much because I&#39;m doing cancer</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.649" end="00:30:30.970" style="s2">research and I&#39;ve had some big</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.440" end="00:30:32.110" style="s2">breakthroughs but I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.970" end="00:30:33.369" style="s2">share that with everyone else just doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.110" end="00:30:35.379" style="s2">cancer research because this is being</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.369" end="00:30:36.399" style="s2">funded by a for-profit process that</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.379" end="00:30:39.220" style="s2">needs to be able to monetize that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.399" end="00:30:41.619" style="s2">intellectual property right and so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:43.539" style="s2">can see how much problem happens as a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.619" end="00:30:45.220" style="s2">result of withholding of information but</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.539" end="00:30:48.940" style="s2">we can also see how intractable this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.220" end="00:30:52.450" style="s2">problem seems within a game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.940" end="00:30:54.580" style="s2">environment like capitalism right I keep</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.450" end="00:30:57.220" style="s2">saying capitalism I&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.580" end="00:30:58.359" style="s2">that any other bad economic system we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.220" end="00:31:00.489" style="s2">ever tried is the answer because they</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.359" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">aren&#39;t we have basis for disinformation</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.489" end="00:31:04.749" style="s2">and communism and socialism and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:07.720" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna suggest that new structures</p>

<p begin="00:31:07.720" end="00:31:12.220" style="s2">I&#39;m just wanting to say that here so</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:14.109" style="s2">people don&#39;t attach to me criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.220" end="00:31:19.090" style="s2">capitalism is probably going to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.109" end="00:31:21.309" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t work so the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.090" end="00:31:25.330" style="s2">thing is withholding information and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.309" end="00:31:28.389" style="s2">see in business how much focus is on IP</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.389" end="00:31:31.359" style="s2">things but then it&#39;s not simply</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.950" end="00:31:33.399" style="s2">withholding information it&#39;s also</p>

<p begin="00:32:48.940" end="00:32:52.179" style="s2">take to have an intact information</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:55.030" style="s2">ecology where any information that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.179" end="00:32:57.490" style="s2">anyone had just on the truthfulness side</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.030" end="00:32:59.620" style="s2">was being shared there was no incentive</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.490" end="00:33:00.760" style="s2">for disinformation first let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.620" end="00:33:03.610" style="s2">imagine that array like no</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.760" end="00:33:05.380" style="s2">disinformation let&#39;s give some other</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.610" end="00:33:07.030" style="s2">examples of disinformation there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.380" end="00:33:08.830" style="s2">just where I&#39;m intentionally trying to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.030" end="00:33:10.870" style="s2">mislead you there&#39;s also where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.830" end="00:33:12.730" style="s2">sharing signal for some purpose for me</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.870" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">that might mislead you in it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.730" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">intending to I just don&#39;t care if I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:21.190" style="s2">so let&#39;s say there I want some increased</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.690" style="s2">attention and this might be because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.190" end="00:33:23.799" style="s2">going to monetize that attention might</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.690" end="00:33:25.150" style="s2">be because I&#39;m going to get political</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.799" end="00:33:27.820" style="s2">power might be simply because I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.150" end="00:33:31.960" style="s2">want attention right so let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.820" end="00:33:34.690" style="s2">comment on what some famous person is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.960" end="00:33:36.400" style="s2">doing let&#39;s say I disagree with him I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.690" end="00:33:39.460" style="s2">instantly going to get some attention if</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.400" end="00:33:41.260" style="s2">I critique them effectively that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.460" end="00:33:44.429" style="s2">didn&#39;t necessarily earn and I don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.289" end="00:33:52.210" style="s2">get some attention so now people have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.850" end="00:33:55.720" style="s2">basis to focus on something they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.210" end="00:33:57.340" style="s2">focused on before to criticize it</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.720" end="00:34:00.429" style="s2">because that will get attention or to</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.340" end="00:34:02.230" style="s2">compliment it or to play off of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.429" end="00:34:06.220" style="s2">way that is not actually what they care</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.230" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">about or believe and again you look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.220" end="00:34:13.090" style="s2">how liquidus it is you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:15.399" style="s2">phenomenon all right so the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.090" end="00:34:17.669" style="s2">getting over the truthfulness issue is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.399" end="00:34:20.909" style="s2">actually post game theoretic world</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.669" end="00:34:24.669" style="s2">because which is the same answers like</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.909" end="00:34:26.200" style="s2">how do we get past warfare well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.669" end="00:34:27.879" style="s2">just kinetic warfare where we throw</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.200" end="00:34:30.790" style="s2">bombs or rocks at each other it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.879" end="00:34:32.440" style="s2">info warfare and narrative warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.790" end="00:34:35.039" style="s2">economic warfare right which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.440" end="00:34:37.029" style="s2">basically any in-group that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.039" end="00:34:39.460" style="s2">coordinating to compete against an</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.029" end="00:34:42.429" style="s2">out-group in some kind of zero-sum</p>

<p begin="00:34:49.179" end="00:34:56.740" style="s2">things what can people do right now</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.220" end="00:35:05.890" style="s2">within a game theoretic world to start</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.740" end="00:35:08.680" style="s2">to create spaces of truthfulness start</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.890" end="00:35:11.740" style="s2">to create relationships where one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.680" end="00:35:13.690" style="s2">highest values is truthfulness with</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.740" end="00:35:15.910" style="s2">other people that are capable of and</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.690" end="00:35:17.529" style="s2">want and are committed to that where</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.910" end="00:35:21.490" style="s2">people are not only not lying to each</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.529" end="00:35:25.510" style="s2">other but they are endeavouring to not</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.490" end="00:35:28.000" style="s2">withhold information which is tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.510" end="00:35:30.670" style="s2">intimacy and tremendous vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.000" end="00:35:34.930" style="s2">and see if you can create enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.670" end="00:35:36.700" style="s2">psychological safety with some people to</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.930" end="00:35:39.059" style="s2">be able to start exploring what does it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.700" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">mean to actually share information</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.059" end="00:35:44.559" style="s2">honestly so that we can have that and</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:50.890" style="s2">all kind of make sense together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.559" end="00:35:52.240" style="s2">one thing and there&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.890" end="00:35:54.160" style="s2">where it&#39;s like if you don&#39;t throw trash</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.240" end="00:35:58.210" style="s2">out the window of your car because you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.160" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">don&#39;t pollute the environment be careful</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.210" end="00:36:04.059" style="s2">about not polluting the information</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:06.970" style="s2">ecology by rationalizing why your own</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.059" end="00:36:08.619" style="s2">miss or disinformation is okay and just</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.970" end="00:36:11.609" style="s2">start to think of it that way think of</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.619" end="00:36:14.680" style="s2">anytime you&#39;re sharing a little lies as</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.609" end="00:36:16.630" style="s2">as polluting the information ecology and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.680" end="00:36:19.589" style="s2">being like oh wow I don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.630" end="00:36:25.450" style="s2">that I would I don&#39;t want to be part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.589" end="00:36:28.029" style="s2">the fucked up information ecology okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.450" end="00:36:30.460" style="s2">so now on the true side which is not</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.029" end="00:36:32.650" style="s2">just a mapping or a correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.460" end="00:36:36.039" style="s2">between what I&#39;m saying and what I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.650" end="00:36:37.990" style="s2">but between what I&#39;m saying and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.039" end="00:36:39.190" style="s2">shared reality is which means there has</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.990" end="00:36:41.170" style="s2">to be a correspondence between what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.190" end="00:36:43.809" style="s2">think in reality that means I had to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.170" end="00:36:46.089" style="s2">since making well before I share</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.809" end="00:36:47.029" style="s2">something right so this is the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.089" end="00:36:50.289" style="s2">a pistol</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.029" end="00:36:54.499" style="s2">so one is movement past game theory</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.289" end="00:36:59.720" style="s2">the next is epistemology how do we know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.499" end="00:37:02.720" style="s2">stuff so even if nobody was lying and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.720" end="00:37:07.390" style="s2">withholding information the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:11.630" style="s2">of the world makes a epistemology hard</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.390" end="00:37:21.200" style="s2">and most people aren&#39;t even endeavoring</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.630" end="00:37:23.089" style="s2">at it so I have if no one was lying and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.200" end="00:37:25.730" style="s2">I could take all the information as at</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.089" end="00:37:27.289" style="s2">least truthful there would be certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.730" end="00:37:29.150" style="s2">epistemic processes that I could apply</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.289" end="00:37:31.009" style="s2">that I can&#39;t apply if I can&#39;t even take</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.150" end="00:37:33.470" style="s2">the sources of signal as being signal</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.009" end="00:37:35.960" style="s2">without a lot of noise right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.470" end="00:37:38.269" style="s2">epistemology that I have to have within</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.960" end="00:37:39.799" style="s2">the context of an inn of an environment</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.269" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">has a lot of disinformation how do I</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.799" end="00:37:44.630" style="s2">make sense of what is true and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:46.700" style="s2">isn&#39;t true about signal coming in and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.630" end="00:37:50.529" style="s2">then how do i parse from lots of Sigma</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.700" end="00:37:54.319" style="s2">what might be true about reality and for</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.529" end="00:37:57.589" style="s2">like to just get a sense of why like how</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.319" end="00:37:58.999" style="s2">big a deal this is you take any of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.589" end="00:38:02.239" style="s2">biggest issues in the world like the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.999" end="00:38:07.069" style="s2">issues that could determine whether or</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.239" end="00:38:08.599" style="s2">not we keep existing as a species okay</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.069" end="00:38:13.489" style="s2">so take big environmental issues like</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.599" end="00:38:14.869" style="s2">climate change there&#39;s disagreement as</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.489" end="00:38:17.569" style="s2">to whether climate change is relieved in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.869" end="00:38:20.509" style="s2">a thing and to the extent that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.569" end="00:38:30.710" style="s2">thing what the causes are and what the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.509" end="00:38:32.989" style="s2">time skills are now most people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.710" end="00:38:34.789" style="s2">believe fervently no climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.989" end="00:38:37.309" style="s2">real 97% of climate scientists agree</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.789" end="00:38:39.079" style="s2">it&#39;s anthropogenic greenhouse gases etc</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.309" end="00:38:41.029" style="s2">most of the people that believe that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.079" end="00:38:42.650" style="s2">fervently enough to kind of like go into</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.029" end="00:38:44.359" style="s2">narrative warfare for it have never</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.650" end="00:38:47.660" style="s2">actually looked at the primary data</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.359" end="00:38:50.690" style="s2">deeply themselves and yet there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.660" end="00:38:53.210" style="s2">almost religious fervor around it that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.690" end="00:38:56.099" style="s2">was based on having proxied their sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.210" end="00:38:57.660" style="s2">making the people who they believe so</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.099" end="00:38:59.519" style="s2">the UN&#39;s headed or the Gates Foundation</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.660" end="00:39:01.650" style="s2">said it or whatever it is I&#39;ve heard it</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.519" end="00:39:03.239" style="s2">repeated enough times just just through</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.650" end="00:39:04.709" style="s2">repeatability like I have been</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.239" end="00:39:05.880" style="s2">programmed to believe this thing is true</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.709" end="00:39:07.199" style="s2">which is not that different than</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.880" end="00:39:11.519" style="s2">believing a fundamentalist religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.199" end="00:39:14.989" style="s2">religious ideal right and let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.519" end="00:39:20.969" style="s2">take people&#39;s fervent ideas on vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.989" end="00:39:27.119" style="s2">or their fervent ideas on the viability</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.969" end="00:39:30.719" style="s2">of market ideology or almost anything</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.119" end="00:39:34.529" style="s2">like that almost no one who has fervent</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.719" end="00:39:35.910" style="s2">ideas has a good epistemic basis for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.529" end="00:39:37.709" style="s2">level of certainty they hold there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.910" end="00:39:39.089" style="s2">decoupling between how much certain team</p>

<p begin="00:39:41.489" end="00:39:44.729" style="s2">then you look at who are they proxying</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.259" end="00:39:45.869" style="s2">their sense making - in most the time</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.729" end="00:39:46.829" style="s2">they&#39;re not even proxying their sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.869" end="00:39:49.769" style="s2">making to the people who did the</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.769" end="00:39:53.160" style="s2">with each other and were funded by</p>

<p begin="00:39:53.160" end="00:39:57.630" style="s2">fully true in the first place and who</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.289" end="00:40:02.069" style="s2">maybe were employing epistemic biases</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.630" end="00:40:04.049" style="s2">themselves but typically it&#39;s somebody</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.069" end="00:40:05.430" style="s2">else who looked at all of that and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.049" end="00:40:06.930" style="s2">someone else who looked at all of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.430" end="00:40:09.959" style="s2">so you might have like a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.930" end="00:40:12.119" style="s2">climate scientists into someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.959" end="00:40:13.949" style="s2">speaking about that as a client&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.119" end="00:40:15.959" style="s2">climate scientists at a more synthetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.949" end="00:40:18.059" style="s2">level like a James Hansen or whatever -</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.959" end="00:40:19.799" style="s2">then like a Gore or someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.059" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">actually speaking to the public who were</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.799" end="00:40:25.109" style="s2">proxying our sense making - and we say</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.079" end="00:40:29.489" style="s2">okay how many steps removed is it and</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.109" end="00:40:32.549" style="s2">how good was the original data and so if</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.489" end="00:40:35.430" style="s2">we think about okay how much radiation</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.549" end="00:40:40.349" style="s2">actually was released into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.430" end="00:40:41.640" style="s2">environment from Fukushima it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.349" end="00:40:43.589" style="s2">a very straightforward thing take a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.640" end="00:40:44.999" style="s2">Geiger counter and go out and do the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.589" end="00:40:47.430" style="s2">studies but how many people are equipped</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.999" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">to take a Geiger counter out and go do</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.430" end="00:40:54.599" style="s2">that or to be able to actually pay</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:56.420" style="s2">attention to how the flow dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.599" end="00:40:58.829" style="s2">the air and the water are gonna work or</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.420" end="00:41:00.359" style="s2">you know so many things and so we have</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.829" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">to take other people&#39;s data to begin</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.359" end="00:41:03.390" style="s2">with and those other people let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">the data was the Japanese government or</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.390" end="00:41:07.890" style="s2">TEPCO or whoever it was or it can</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:09.089" style="s2">a conspiracy theory group that is saying</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.890" end="00:41:10.770" style="s2">no no it&#39;s actually releasing huge</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.089" end="00:41:13.369" style="s2">amounts of ocean all the fish are</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.770" end="00:41:15.960" style="s2">totally toxified but they might just be</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.369" end="00:41:18.570" style="s2">they have a basis to dis inform because</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.960" end="00:41:20.849" style="s2">they&#39;re getting viewership that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.570" end="00:41:23.580" style="s2">monetizing through that what how the</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.849" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">fuck do we make sense of it right so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.580" end="00:41:28.140" style="s2">what we start to get is it&#39;s like is AI</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:31.050" style="s2">gonna solve a bunch of problems and be</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.140" end="00:41:33.810" style="s2">relatively safe or is AI the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.050" end="00:41:36.000" style="s2">risk and going to kill us and you see</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.810" end="00:41:37.349" style="s2">the you see kind of fervent disagreement</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.000" end="00:41:40.170" style="s2">but you see a still pedal-to-the-metal</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.349" end="00:41:44.730" style="s2">going as fast forward as we can with AI</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.170" end="00:41:46.440" style="s2">and with CRISPR biotech and with every</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.730" end="00:41:52.790" style="s2">type of exponential technology that</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.440" end="00:41:55.230" style="s2">could be catastrophic and and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.790" end="00:42:00.000" style="s2">increasing speed of choice making with</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.230" end="00:42:02.330" style="s2">decreasing sense-making and to just</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.000" end="00:42:05.670" style="s2">think about like okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.330" end="00:42:07.619" style="s2">or even what&#39;s really going on with the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.670" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">Chinese government and its cyber warfare</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.619" end="00:42:13.980" style="s2">relationship of the US government and</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">with kind of the what its actual</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.980" end="00:42:18.180" style="s2">capacities are and what its intent and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:20.490" style="s2">agency is and those types of issues well</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.180" end="00:42:22.290" style="s2">we know that&#39;s going to be obscured we</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.490" end="00:42:23.970" style="s2">know both sides and all kinds of sites</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.290" end="00:42:25.470" style="s2">are gonna be obscuring information and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.970" end="00:42:27.180" style="s2">it gets even worse because it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.470" end="00:42:28.440" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got this group of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.180" end="00:42:31.740" style="s2">called China and this group of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.440" end="00:42:33.060" style="s2">called the US and that they&#39;re in a game</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.740" end="00:42:35.790" style="s2">theoretic relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.060" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">but everybody on Team USA cooperates</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.790" end="00:42:39.599" style="s2">perfectly you know of course it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">that right so even within the</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.599" end="00:42:43.140" style="s2">intelligence agencies I might have two</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:44.760" style="s2">different intelligence agencies that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.140" end="00:42:46.980" style="s2">supposed to be cooperating but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.760" end="00:42:47.580" style="s2">competing for a bigger percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.980" end="00:42:49.619" style="s2">black-budget</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.580" end="00:42:51.240" style="s2">and so they might be withholding</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.619" end="00:42:52.530" style="s2">information from each other or even dis</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.240" end="00:42:55.770" style="s2">informing each other then I might have</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.530" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">two agents within an agency competing</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.770" end="00:42:59.820" style="s2">for the same promotion who might run</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:02.310" style="s2">disinfo on each other so I have fractal</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.820" end="00:43:04.290" style="s2">disinformation right at almost every</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.310" end="00:43:06.510" style="s2">place because of a game theory at a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.290" end="00:43:08.250" style="s2">consent of system which is the balance</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.510" end="00:43:10.619" style="s2">sheet of countries the balance sheet of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.250" end="00:43:12.270" style="s2">organizations the balance sheet of all</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.619" end="00:43:17.510" style="s2">the way down to individual people right</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.270" end="00:43:17.510" style="s2">this separation of the of agency</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.190" end="00:43:24.670" style="s2">- now I&#39;m back to a game theory truth on</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.690" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">the side but I have to factor that when</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.670" end="00:43:27.420" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to make sense of things</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:29.620" style="s2">because I have to be able to parse</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.420" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">signal from noise to then be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.620" end="00:43:34.180" style="s2">synthesize the signal but then even if</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:35.710" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t the case I&#39;m just just</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.180" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">trying to do a pistol mala Jeon good</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.710" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">signal and I have to say ok in a complex</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.710" style="s2">system like we&#39;re we can&#39;t even forecast</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:48.180" style="s2">the weather ten days out very well how</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.710" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">do i forecast the effect of putting</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.180" end="00:43:52.360" style="s2">certain kinds of pesticides or</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.560" end="00:43:53.950" style="s2">genetically modified organisms or</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.360" end="00:43:55.210" style="s2">whatever into the environments right</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.950" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a complex system that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.210" end="00:44:00.130" style="s2">forecast very well at all we we don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:02.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know the tiniest bit of the actual</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.130" end="00:44:03.340" style="s2">information of how that complex system</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.290" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">is going to regulate but we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.340" end="00:44:07.810" style="s2">do stuff that affects those systems at</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.430" style="s2">scale what is the right epistemology to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.810" end="00:44:13.060" style="s2">be able to make sense of is this a good</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.430" end="00:44:14.230" style="s2">choice and so you can see and we know</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.060" end="00:44:15.370" style="s2">what are all the metrics we have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.230" end="00:44:20.680" style="s2">factor let&#39;s say we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.370" end="00:44:22.840" style="s2">biotech ok so I can give you a drug that</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.680" end="00:44:24.700" style="s2">is good for some biometric that happens</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.840" end="00:44:27.970" style="s2">to be associated with the disease that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.700" end="00:44:31.660" style="s2">I&#39;m taking I&#39;m trying to get the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.970" end="00:44:33.400" style="s2">to be able to use this drug allowed by</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.660" end="00:44:35.320" style="s2">the FDA to treat a particular disease</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.400" end="00:44:36.880" style="s2">and then since the disease is identified</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.320" end="00:44:38.500" style="s2">by this biomarker I have to affect this</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.880" end="00:44:40.450" style="s2">biomarker so let&#39;s say I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.500" end="00:44:43.330" style="s2">high cholesterol and so we develop a</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.450" end="00:44:46.030" style="s2">statin for it how many other metrics are</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.330" end="00:44:47.410" style="s2">this is the statin effecting well every</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.030" end="00:44:50.050" style="s2">day we&#39;re learning new biometrics we</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.410" end="00:44:51.340" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know existed how many of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:52.930" style="s2">those are being affected they&#39;re part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.340" end="00:44:54.340" style="s2">the unknown unknown set that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.930" end="00:44:56.860" style="s2">even know to be able to do risk</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.340" end="00:44:59.320" style="s2">calculation on now we could say well</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.860" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">let&#39;s run the experiment long enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.320" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">before we release the drug to see if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:04.570" style="s2">affects total longevity and all cause</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:06.940" style="s2">mortality well nobody fucking does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.570" end="00:45:08.800" style="s2">nobody&#39;s gonna run a hundred year</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.940" end="00:45:10.330" style="s2">experiments on something before they</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.800" end="00:45:12.580" style="s2">release the thing they&#39;re gonna run the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.330" end="00:45:14.200" style="s2">shortest ones they can so we&#39;re you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.580" end="00:45:15.430" style="s2">a system that has delayed causation how</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.200" end="00:45:16.630" style="s2">do I know if that&#39;s creating problems</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.430" end="00:45:16.840" style="s2">way down the road well it does all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.630" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.840" end="00:45:21.280" style="s2">right so we get rid of DDT or parathion</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:22.420" style="s2">or malathion because we see that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.280" end="00:45:24.100" style="s2">super poisonous after we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.420" end="00:45:25.600" style="s2">spraying it on everybody and then we</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.100" end="00:45:27.370" style="s2">bring in a new drug that we also didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.600" end="00:45:28.290" style="s2">do long term Studies on I mean a new</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.370" end="00:45:30.390" style="s2">pesticide</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.290" end="00:45:32.190" style="s2">and then we outlaw it after a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.390" end="00:45:34.140" style="s2">while and then we bring in new one the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.190" end="00:45:35.490" style="s2">new ones aren&#39;t safer they just haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.140" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">had as much time to show how dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.490" end="00:45:40.260" style="s2">they are so then the question is like</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:42.150" style="s2">what would the right epistemology be how</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.260" end="00:45:44.100" style="s2">many metrics do I have to factor how do</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.150" end="00:45:45.810" style="s2">I know how to factor those metrics what</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.100" end="00:45:48.360" style="s2">is the total information complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.810" end="00:45:50.220" style="s2">the scenario relative to how much I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.360" end="00:45:53.490" style="s2">actually the information complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.220" end="00:45:57.590" style="s2">the assessment that we&#39;ve done so we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.490" end="00:46:00.120" style="s2">get into at some depth the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.590" end="00:46:04.140" style="s2">appropriate epistemology for various</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.120" end="00:46:06.150" style="s2">contexts but the I guess the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.140" end="00:46:09.810" style="s2">I can say is that if people aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.150" end="00:46:11.370" style="s2">thinking about that their chance of</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.810" end="00:46:17.970" style="s2">making sense well is pretty close to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.370" end="00:46:22.110" style="s2">zero if we think about the concept of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.970" end="00:46:24.210" style="s2">meme the way that Dawkins originally put</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.110" end="00:46:25.590" style="s2">it forward it&#39;s a abstract pattern</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.210" end="00:46:27.690" style="s2">replicator where a gene is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.590" end="00:46:30.140" style="s2">instantiated pattern replicator which</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.690" end="00:46:33.570" style="s2">means that it can mutate and change and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.140" end="00:46:37.320" style="s2">affect behavior and propagate much much</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.570" end="00:46:39.960" style="s2">much faster right and we can kind of say</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.320" end="00:46:42.090" style="s2">that in Homo sapiens our genetics</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.960" end="00:46:45.570" style="s2">selected for memetics for higher-order</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.090" end="00:46:49.770" style="s2">mimetics right our genetics because most</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.570" end="00:46:51.360" style="s2">other species what the selective</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.770" end="00:46:54.180" style="s2">pressures had them be adaptive to an</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.360" end="00:46:56.820" style="s2">environment right they there&#39;s mutation</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.180" end="00:46:58.110" style="s2">and then the mutations that survive and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.820" end="00:47:00.570" style="s2">make the best are the ones that make it</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.110" end="00:47:02.910" style="s2">through but that&#39;s within the context of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.570" end="00:47:04.440" style="s2">survive in that environment and are able</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.910" end="00:47:05.700" style="s2">to mate successfully in that environment</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.440" end="00:47:07.740" style="s2">so they become more more fit to their</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.700" end="00:47:09.630" style="s2">environment so the cheetah does really</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.740" end="00:47:10.800" style="s2">well in the savanna I would not do well</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.630" end="00:47:12.990" style="s2">in the Arctic and the polar bear</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.800" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do wellness it in an orca</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.990" end="00:47:16.530" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t do well outside of the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:18.860" style="s2">right like so they they are well adapt</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.530" end="00:47:21.090" style="s2">to their environment because of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.860" end="00:47:23.430" style="s2">abstraction capacity which is both our</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.090" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">capacity for language and memes as well</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.430" end="00:47:30.450" style="s2">as tools we were able to go and become</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:32.760" style="s2">adaptive become actually apex predators</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.450" end="00:47:34.650" style="s2">in the savanna and in the Arctic and in</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.760" end="00:47:36.180" style="s2">the ocean and everywhere right we were</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.650" end="00:47:37.640" style="s2">able to go to every environment which</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.180" end="00:47:39.870" style="s2">means that as soon as our population</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.640" end="00:47:40.600" style="s2">would normally if we were any other</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.870" end="00:47:43.000" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.600" end="00:47:44.200" style="s2">to level off in relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.000" end="00:47:46.120" style="s2">environmental carrying capacity of an</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.200" end="00:47:47.710" style="s2">environment we just moved we were able</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.120" end="00:47:49.930" style="s2">to decimate that environment and move to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.710" end="00:47:52.750" style="s2">the next one right into all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.930" end="00:47:53.410" style="s2">then but that part isn&#39;t the part I want</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.750" end="00:47:55.540" style="s2">to get into it now</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.410" end="00:47:57.790" style="s2">it&#39;s that since we were gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.540" end="00:47:59.590" style="s2">adaptive to totally new environments and</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.790" end="00:48:03.510" style="s2">since we were gonna create tools where</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.590" end="00:48:07.330" style="s2">what it was to be adaptive was changing</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.510" end="00:48:09.400" style="s2">sin since we modify our environment in</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.330" end="00:48:11.770" style="s2">ways the other animals don&#39;t we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.400" end="00:48:13.540" style="s2">come in genetically fit to a specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.770" end="00:48:14.980" style="s2">environment we have to come in and be</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.540" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">able to imprint the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.980" end="00:48:18.570" style="s2">we&#39;re in so we know how to be fit two</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:22.180" style="s2">totally different environments cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.570" end="00:48:24.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not that adaptive for us to throw</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.180" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2">Spears or even climb trees all that well</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.520" end="00:48:27.790" style="s2">but it is to be able to like text and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:30.670" style="s2">drive and stuff that wouldn&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.790" end="00:48:34.630" style="s2">adaptive thousand years ago at all and</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.670" end="00:48:37.600" style="s2">so this is why human babies are</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.630" end="00:48:39.760" style="s2">embryonic or jnanis for so long right</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.600" end="00:48:41.800" style="s2">compared to any other animal if you like</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.760" end="00:48:43.360" style="s2">the thing I like to do here is to think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:45.940" style="s2">about a horse standing up in like 20</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.360" end="00:48:48.700" style="s2">minutes and a human being able to walk</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.940" end="00:48:50.860" style="s2">in like a year and just think about how</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.700" end="00:48:53.860" style="s2">many 20 minute segments multiplied into</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.860" end="00:48:55.750" style="s2">a year to get a sense of how much longer</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.860" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">we are helpless than anything else is</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.750" end="00:49:00.040" style="s2">and even amongst the other primates</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:02.590" style="s2">close to us is there&#39;s really nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.040" end="00:49:05.800" style="s2">like us in terms of the extended</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.590" end="00:49:07.780" style="s2">helplessness and that&#39;s because we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.800" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have inherited knowledge of how to</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.780" end="00:49:10.540" style="s2">be us since the environment is going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:12.250" style="s2">be different we have to imprint the</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.540" end="00:49:13.600" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re in to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.250" end="00:49:21.990" style="s2">be adaptive to environments that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.600" end="00:49:25.900" style="s2">changing right so and so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.990" end="00:49:27.910" style="s2">saying that our genetics selected for</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.900" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">neuroplasticity selected for memetics</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.910" end="00:49:32.520" style="s2">our hardware selected for faster</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:35.710" style="s2">software updates that could have faster</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.520" end="00:49:37.450" style="s2">changes in adaptive basis so that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.710" end="00:49:42.490" style="s2">could move our environments and all</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.450" end="00:49:44.650" style="s2">those types of things so if we think</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.490" end="00:49:46.810" style="s2">about a meat and kind of like a gene as</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.650" end="00:49:48.490" style="s2">an ax pattern replicator but as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.810" end="00:49:51.400" style="s2">abstract pattern replicator that can</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.490" end="00:49:53.550" style="s2">mutate much quicker there&#39;s also a big</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.400" end="00:49:57.510" style="s2">differences that the other animals are</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.550" end="00:49:59.910" style="s2">it in an environment the mutation across</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.510" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">genes is very evenly distributed</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.910" end="00:50:06.990" style="s2">mutations happening to the gazelles and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:09.210" style="s2">to the cheetahs at an equal rate right</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.990" end="00:50:10.770" style="s2">and there&#39;s Co selective pressures on</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.210" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">both of them so they&#39;re both getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.770" end="00:50:14.369" style="s2">faster the slowest ones of each are</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.740" style="s2">dying off and so there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.369" end="00:50:18.300" style="s2">symmetry of power that has the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.740" end="00:50:21.210" style="s2">competitive pressures between them have</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.300" end="00:50:24.270" style="s2">them all up level but when we start</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.210" end="00:50:26.010" style="s2">being mostly mimetic and the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.270" end="00:50:27.570" style="s2">species are still mostly genetic meaning</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.010" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">we&#39;re largely based we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.570" end="00:50:30.630" style="s2">adaptive based on abstract pattern</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:32.280" style="s2">replicators are still in stan see a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.630" end="00:50:34.020" style="s2">pattern replicators we can increase our</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.280" end="00:50:35.910" style="s2">per date of capacity much faster than</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.020" end="00:50:37.740" style="s2">they can increase their than the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.910" end="00:50:39.570" style="s2">environment can increase its resilience</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.740" end="00:50:41.850" style="s2">to our creative capacity which means</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.570" end="00:50:43.980" style="s2">that we can debase the whole substrate</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.850" end="00:50:45.510" style="s2">that we depend upon which is self</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.980" end="00:50:48.290" style="s2">terminating right you can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.510" end="00:50:51.450" style="s2">debasing that which you depend upon so</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.290" end="00:50:54.119" style="s2">in evolution there is a selection</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.450" end="00:50:59.130" style="s2">process for the genes that make it</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.119" end="00:51:01.020" style="s2">through right but they there is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.130" end="00:51:02.550" style="s2">kind of symmetry of the genes that make</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.020" end="00:51:05.220" style="s2">it through because of the evenness of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.550" end="00:51:08.670" style="s2">mutation and because of the co selective</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.220" end="00:51:11.460" style="s2">pressures now with mimetics the memes</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.670" end="00:51:13.710" style="s2">that make it through are the memes that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.460" end="00:51:15.540" style="s2">win in a rival risk context not the ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.710" end="00:51:16.740" style="s2">that necessarily represents the true or</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.540" end="00:51:19.530" style="s2">the good or the beautiful so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.740" end="00:51:21.690" style="s2">propagated memes propagate more than the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.530" end="00:51:24.560" style="s2">true memes propagate this is a super</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.690" end="00:51:28.050" style="s2">important concept to understand which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.560" end="00:51:30.990" style="s2">like I was always dumbfounded thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.050" end="00:51:32.400" style="s2">about the evolution of religions take</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.990" end="00:51:37.260" style="s2">Christianity for instance and you say</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.400" end="00:51:39.570" style="s2">okay so Jesus when they brought Mary</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.260" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">Magdalene said let he who has no</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.570" end="00:51:42.900" style="s2">sentence amongst you cast the first</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:44.070" style="s2">stone right and then when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.900" end="00:51:45.780" style="s2">nailing him up he says Father forgive</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.070" end="00:51:48.630" style="s2">them for they know not what they they do</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.780" end="00:51:51.630" style="s2">and he&#39;s like bringing forgiveness to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.630" end="00:51:54.090" style="s2">Judaism and in his name we did the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.630" end="00:51:56.340" style="s2">Crusades in the Inquisition and said we</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.090" end="00:51:59.280" style="s2">will not just kill but torture anyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.340" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t accept the Lord of peace is</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.280" end="00:52:04.200" style="s2">there like how the fuck did we do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:07.530" style="s2">how did we do the mental gymnastics</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.200" end="00:52:09.059" style="s2">to take the guy whose key teachings were</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.530" end="00:52:10.680" style="s2">forgiveness and torture people in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.059" end="00:52:12.780" style="s2">name of that well we figured out how to</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.680" end="00:52:15.930" style="s2">do it right but the key is that we was</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.780" end="00:52:18.569" style="s2">super adaptive so you you&#39;ve got an idea</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.930" end="00:52:21.420" style="s2">right say you&#39;ve got Jesus teachings or</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.569" end="00:52:22.859" style="s2">we can take it in any of them and then</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.420" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a bunch of mutations</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.859" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">on that idea different interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:34.290" style="s2">of it some of the mutations say be quiet</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:38.010" style="s2">and don&#39;t push your ideas on anyone like</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.290" end="00:52:40.170" style="s2">be contemplative and you know etc and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.010" end="00:52:41.910" style="s2">those ones don&#39;t catch on because they</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.170" end="00:52:44.730" style="s2">aren&#39;t being intentionally propagated</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.910" end="00:52:46.799" style="s2">and other ones say go out and propagate</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.730" end="00:52:49.589" style="s2">these ideas on missions and on Crusades</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.799" end="00:52:51.569" style="s2">and focus on the not the forgiveness</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.589" end="00:52:53.460" style="s2">parts but on the like wrath and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.569" end="00:52:56.520" style="s2">Leviticus and who God&#39;s enemies we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.460" end="00:53:00.319" style="s2">like focus on those parts and that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.520" end="00:53:03.660" style="s2">actually get better spots in heaven for</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.319" end="00:53:05.490" style="s2">converting more people right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.660" end="00:53:07.230" style="s2">what you end up getting is that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.490" end="00:53:10.290" style="s2">ideas that catch on are the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.230" end="00:53:12.930" style="s2">win and narrative warfare but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.290" end="00:53:14.190" style="s2">having to catch on so then say Islam is</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.930" end="00:53:16.740" style="s2">also competing for some of the same</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.190" end="00:53:19.859" style="s2">people right because ultimately the</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.740" end="00:53:21.569" style="s2">religions become the basis of in groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.859" end="00:53:24.630" style="s2">that are competing against out groups</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.569" end="00:53:27.630" style="s2">for fundamentally political and economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.630" end="00:53:30.869" style="s2">and survival type basis so I can hold</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.630" end="00:53:33.510" style="s2">people together with a political left or</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.869" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">political right ideology or a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.510" end="00:53:37.440" style="s2">communist ideology or racial identity</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:40.650" style="s2">ideology or religious ideologies all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.440" end="00:53:43.380" style="s2">those become the basis of an in-group</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.650" end="00:53:45.089" style="s2">that can be that can bind together to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.380" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">more successful in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.089" end="00:53:49.079" style="s2">assumed out groups right but what that</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:51.630" style="s2">means is that rival risk game theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.079" end="00:53:53.730" style="s2">environment is going to be selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.630" end="00:53:57.569" style="s2">what is effective at rivalry not what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.730" end="00:53:59.250" style="s2">true and and definitely not what is good</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.569" end="00:54:00.869" style="s2">for the whole and the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.250" end="00:54:02.910" style="s2">anybody figures something out that is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.869" end="00:54:04.890" style="s2">more effective at rivalry than everybody</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.910" end="00:54:06.990" style="s2">else reverse engineers it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.890" end="00:54:11.460" style="s2">creates similar mimetic mutations on</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.990" end="00:54:14.670" style="s2">other sides and so there&#39;s not that many</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.460" end="00:54:17.550" style="s2">James right there they&#39;re lovely people</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.670" end="00:54:19.050" style="s2">right and totally nonviolent and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.550" end="00:54:20.550" style="s2">aren&#39;t you know aren&#39;t gonna hurt</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.050" end="00:54:22.020" style="s2">anybody but they&#39;re also not pushing</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.550" end="00:54:24.060" style="s2">their ideas on anybody so the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.020" end="00:54:26.099" style="s2">aren&#39;t spreading that fast so the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.060" end="00:54:29.180" style="s2">that have an artificial focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.099" end="00:54:30.990" style="s2">spreading of ideas and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.180" end="00:54:32.849" style="s2">emotionally manipulate people into</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.990" end="00:54:36.930" style="s2">believing the idea with heaven and hell</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.849" end="00:54:42.810" style="s2">and whatever right are going to spread</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.930" end="00:54:45.480" style="s2">more so this is a key thing to get is</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.810" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">you know whether we&#39;re taking it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.480" end="00:54:49.020" style="s2">not just right I&#39;m giving the example of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:51.089" style="s2">the teachings of Jesus turning into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.020" end="00:54:55.050" style="s2">Crusades or the Inquisition but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.089" end="00:54:57.300" style="s2">also take thinking like Darwin right so</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.050" end="00:55:00.690" style="s2">take the context in which Darwin came</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.300" end="00:55:05.070" style="s2">about Darwin came about just following</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.690" end="00:55:07.290" style="s2">Malthus right so so we got the British</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.070" end="00:55:09.599" style="s2">Empire&#39;s first kind of real world ruling</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.290" end="00:55:11.310" style="s2">Empire first time that a global</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.599" end="00:55:12.089" style="s2">inventory of resources was ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.310" end="00:55:14.099" style="s2">conducted</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.089" end="00:55:16.109" style="s2">Malthus came up with the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.099" end="00:55:18.210" style="s2">principle of scarcity or inadequacy says</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.109" end="00:55:19.800" style="s2">hey people are reproducing geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.210" end="00:55:20.700" style="s2">resources reproduce her thematically</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.800" end="00:55:22.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be enough for</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.700" end="00:55:24.570" style="s2">everybody not everybody&#39;s gonna make it</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.200" end="00:55:26.730" style="s2">well then who&#39;s gonna make it fuck that</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.570" end="00:55:28.440" style="s2">idea says compassion is not viable we</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.730" end="00:55:29.760" style="s2">can&#39;t all make it fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.440" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">mathematically there aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.760" end="00:55:35.130" style="s2">resources for now this is gibberish</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:37.609" style="s2">actually today because we know that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.130" end="00:55:39.119" style="s2">populations don&#39;t reproduce</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.609" end="00:55:41.220" style="s2">exponentially forever</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.119" end="00:55:43.380" style="s2">they steady-state and we&#39;ve already seen</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.220" end="00:55:46.349" style="s2">the population in Japan and in Denmark</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.380" end="00:55:48.030" style="s2">and another like the most economically</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.349" end="00:55:51.030" style="s2">successful countries start decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.030" end="00:55:53.460" style="s2">right and we also know that we can</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.030" end="00:55:54.990" style="s2">recycle resources we don&#39;t have to just</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.460" end="00:55:56.550" style="s2">have a linear materials economy where we</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.990" end="00:55:58.740" style="s2">use them up and turn them into trash and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.550" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">that completely fundamentally changes</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.740" end="00:56:01.710" style="s2">the underlying scarcity basis we can</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:04.470" style="s2">also share resources in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.710" end="00:56:06.630" style="s2">so the underlying thinking behind</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.470" end="00:56:07.980" style="s2">Malthus isn&#39;t true but he didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.630" end="00:56:08.550" style="s2">that at the time it seemed quite</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.980" end="00:56:11.550" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.550" end="00:56:12.810" style="s2">so then we say okay so fuck a solution</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.550" end="00:56:16.260" style="s2">for everyone a world that works for all</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.810" end="00:56:22.320" style="s2">is not even viable those who want it are</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.260" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">simply not facing up to reality and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.320" end="00:56:25.050" style="s2">if not everyone&#39;s gonna make it who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:27.810" style="s2">going to and so then Darwin comes out in</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.050" end="00:56:29.760" style="s2">that context and so the idea of survival</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.810" end="00:56:31.050" style="s2">of the fittest is the idea we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.760" end="00:56:33.480" style="s2">the most even though that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.050" end="00:56:36.600" style="s2">that he emphasized early in the writing</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.480" end="00:56:39.060" style="s2">hardly at all right and so there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.600" end="00:56:43.760" style="s2">again taking Darwin&#39;s idea in one</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.060" end="00:56:45.810" style="s2">context and then also taking the most</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.760" end="00:56:49.670" style="s2">propagated version of it that led to</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.810" end="00:56:53.450" style="s2">social Darwinism that basically reified</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.670" end="00:56:56.010" style="s2">institutional sociopathy right which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.450" end="00:56:57.150" style="s2">okay well if not everybody&#39;s gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.010" end="00:56:58.860" style="s2">it some people are gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.150" end="00:57:01.800" style="s2">predators other people are gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.860" end="00:57:03.810" style="s2">prey predators don&#39;t feel bad when prey</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.800" end="00:57:06.750" style="s2">died you have to actually call the herd</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.810" end="00:57:10.050" style="s2">sometimes like there and if you start to</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.750" end="00:57:12.840" style="s2">think about how hierarchical power</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.050" end="00:57:14.700" style="s2">structures work to get to the top of a</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.840" end="00:57:16.670" style="s2">hierarchical power structure like a big</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.700" end="00:57:18.980" style="s2">corporation or a government or a</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.670" end="00:57:20.760" style="s2">religion that&#39;s structured that way</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.980" end="00:57:22.200" style="s2">let&#39;s leave that one off for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.760" end="00:57:24.810" style="s2">just say corporation or government I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.200" end="00:57:26.760" style="s2">have to win at a lot of win-lose games I</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.810" end="00:57:28.470" style="s2">have to get the promotion over or win at</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.760" end="00:57:29.610" style="s2">the campaign over other people where</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.470" end="00:57:32.130" style="s2">zero something somebody wins somebody</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.610" end="00:57:33.600" style="s2">loses right so the top is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.130" end="00:57:37.980" style="s2">people who were best at winning out win</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.600" end="00:57:40.320" style="s2">those games so it&#39;s actually going to so</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.980" end="00:57:42.120" style="s2">if I have a lot of empathy and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.320" end="00:57:43.590" style="s2">want and I actually care about other</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.120" end="00:57:44.940" style="s2">people&#39;s loss I&#39;m gonna do less well if</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.590" end="00:57:46.350" style="s2">I&#39;m a sociopath and don&#39;t give a shit</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.940" end="00:57:48.420" style="s2">about it I&#39;m gonna do better at that if</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.350" end="00:57:49.830" style="s2">I&#39;m willing to dis inform to get ahead</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.420" end="00:57:51.900" style="s2">I&#39;ll do better at so this is why we see</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.830" end="00:57:54.060" style="s2">higher percentage of sociopaths and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.900" end="00:57:57.270" style="s2">Psychopaths as CEOs and in the normal</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.060" end="00:57:58.470" style="s2">distribution of population which also</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.270" end="00:58:00.350" style="s2">means that the people have the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.470" end="00:58:03.950" style="s2">influence in the world are</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.350" end="00:58:07.650" style="s2">asymmetrically empowered and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.950" end="00:58:11.340" style="s2">asymmetrically sociopathic but the way</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.650" end="00:58:13.590" style="s2">that we interpreted Darwin was to was</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.340" end="00:58:15.810" style="s2">reifying that as a reasonable thing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.590" end="00:58:18.000" style="s2">even a good thing so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.810" end="00:58:20.130" style="s2">recognize that any idea even if it</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.000" end="00:58:23.130" style="s2">started as true or good or beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.130" end="00:58:26.370" style="s2">gets put into the game theoretic mill</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.130" end="00:58:28.620" style="s2">right and what comes what propagates is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.370" end="00:58:31.860" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s propagated so why do</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.620" end="00:58:36.930" style="s2">bad ideas catch on like largely for this</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.860" end="00:58:39.300" style="s2">reason so oftentimes the best ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.930" end="00:58:40.680" style="s2">not well marketed and aren&#39;t even easily</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.300" end="00:58:42.720" style="s2">marketable and</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.480" end="00:58:53.910" style="s2">something that people have to really pay</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.220" end="00:58:55.170" style="s2">attention to is I think Jordan in one of</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.910" end="00:58:56.819" style="s2">his interviews with you talked about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.170" end="00:59:02.010" style="s2">difference between real thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.819" end="00:59:04.170" style="s2">simulated thinking so if I&#39;m just taking</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.010" end="00:59:06.750" style="s2">memes that I&#39;ve heard I&#39;m in a</p>

<p begin="00:59:09.480" end="00:59:14.910" style="s2">heard somewhere else I&#39;m basically a</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.690" end="00:59:31.260" style="s2">people hear something here a meme that</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.970" end="00:59:32.520" style="s2">comes in and because it&#39;s from Fox they</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.260" end="00:59:34.619" style="s2">believe it or don&#39;t believe it or</p>

<p begin="00:59:34.619" end="00:59:38.250" style="s2">they believe it or don&#39;t believe it so</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.819" end="00:59:41.640" style="s2">they basically have some cluster of</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.250" end="00:59:44.069" style="s2">memes that creates like a memetic immune</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.640" end="00:59:45.569" style="s2">system that says which idea is to accept</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.069" end="00:59:47.900" style="s2">and which one&#39;s to reject and then once</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.569" end="00:59:51.720" style="s2">it&#39;s accepted then propagates them</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.900" end="00:59:55.710" style="s2">that&#39;s not thinking and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.720" end="00:59:58.890" style="s2">sovereignty in that and groups that have</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.710" end="01:00:01.500" style="s2">asymmetric mean broadcast capacity are</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.890" end="01:00:03.900" style="s2">good at making memes that are sticky</p>

<p begin="01:00:03.900" end="01:00:08.789" style="s2">being able to split test uptake right</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:10.859" style="s2">and then being able to you know then you</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.789" end="01:00:12.180" style="s2">get into high tech things like Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.859" end="01:00:14.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay I can actually pay</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.180" end="01:00:16.500" style="s2">attention to what you click on and do</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.520" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">profoundly deep analytics I can pay</p>

<p begin="01:00:28.859" end="01:00:35.490" style="s2">is stuff that Tristan Harris talks about</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.980" end="01:00:40.710" style="s2">and so the AI that beats Kasparov at</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.490" end="01:00:42.450" style="s2">chess easily it&#39;ll nobody is as good at</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.710" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">being strategic with themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.450" end="01:00:45.779" style="s2">Kasparov is a chess and we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:47.400" style="s2">know that we&#39;re engaged in that and yet</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.779" end="01:00:49.500" style="s2">it&#39;s competing with us for our attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.400" end="01:00:52.109" style="s2">for the its purpose of maximize time</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.500" end="01:00:53.829" style="s2">on-site now it just happens to be that</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.109" end="01:00:55.779" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna scroll and bounce unless</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.829" end="01:00:57.219" style="s2">than catches my attention short things</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.779" end="01:00:57.930" style="s2">will catch my attention more because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.219" end="01:01:01.150" style="s2">in a hurry</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.930" end="01:01:03.640" style="s2">so just orientation for small bit size</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.150" end="01:01:07.059" style="s2">makes everyone more fundamentalists with</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.640" end="01:01:09.009" style="s2">shittier attention spans and then if the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.059" end="01:01:10.839" style="s2">headline is more kind of sensational</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.009" end="01:01:12.849" style="s2">it&#39;s going to attract attention more so</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.839" end="01:01:14.109" style="s2">then we get these big platforms that</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.849" end="01:01:16.359" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make people</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.109" end="01:01:19.180" style="s2">fundamentalists or how to drive politics</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.359" end="01:01:20.979" style="s2">but they do simply as a byproduct of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.180" end="01:01:22.719" style="s2">fact that limbic hijacks are sticky and</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.979" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">they&#39;re optimizing for time on sight</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.719" end="01:01:30.539" style="s2">so first thing is that individual memes</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:33.309" style="s2">don&#39;t get selected for mean memes</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.539" end="01:01:36.789" style="s2">interrelate with other memes to create</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.309" end="01:01:39.759" style="s2">world views because I usually can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.789" end="01:01:43.420" style="s2">a choice based on a meet and I have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.759" end="01:01:45.219" style="s2">make a choice based on a representation</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.420" end="01:01:46.930" style="s2">of the world just going to be a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.219" end="01:01:49.690" style="s2">ideas write a bunch of memes a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.930" end="01:01:53.529" style="s2">data and so we get these kind of meme</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.690" end="01:01:57.579" style="s2">complexes and so we can think about the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.529" end="01:02:00.039" style="s2">evolution of meme complexes so let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.579" end="01:02:03.900" style="s2">ahead and look at like the evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.039" end="01:02:09.069" style="s2">religious ideas we can look at the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.900" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">evolution of political ideas or anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.069" end="01:02:18.630" style="s2">scientific ideas so religious ideas so</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:21.069" style="s2">you&#39;ll have some kind of central meme</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.630" end="01:02:24.729" style="s2">but then you&#39;ll also have protector</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.069" end="01:02:27.279" style="s2">memes that emerge with it that also</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.729" end="01:02:29.079" style="s2">believing them protects against the kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.279" end="01:02:30.849" style="s2">of cognitive processes that could have</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.079" end="01:02:34.029" style="s2">someone stop believing the primary mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.849" end="01:02:35.769" style="s2">because if the primary intent last so</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.029" end="01:02:37.180" style="s2">the question isn&#39;t just what makes a</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.769" end="01:02:41.289" style="s2">meme propagate but also what makes it</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.180" end="01:02:45.130" style="s2">endure and resist change so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.289" end="01:02:47.109" style="s2">evolution of memes but also they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.130" end="01:02:48.369" style="s2">mean complexes resilience in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.109" end="01:02:49.869" style="s2">presence of other competing meme</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.369" end="01:02:52.959" style="s2">complexes right so we&#39;ll give these</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.869" end="01:02:55.299" style="s2">protector memes and then we&#39;ll also give</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.959" end="01:02:57.279" style="s2">propagator memes that are trying to take</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.299" end="01:02:58.900" style="s2">the whole complex and propagate it so</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.279" end="01:03:00.819" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a whole football team of</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.900" end="01:03:02.890" style="s2">defense and offense and carrying the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.819" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">ball and right like that happens so</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.890" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:09.220" style="s2">get some kind of fundamentalist religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:12.020" style="s2">so let&#39;s say we we look at Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.220" end="01:03:15.140" style="s2">this would be the same for any religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.020" end="01:03:18.260" style="s2">this just probably the one that most</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.140" end="01:03:19.880" style="s2">people here will relate to so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.260" end="01:03:25.069" style="s2">have some kind of central doctrinal</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.880" end="01:03:27.410" style="s2">teachings about Christ and God and what</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.069" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">good is and those types of things but</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.410" end="01:03:32.750" style="s2">then protector memes are what could make</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:35.809" style="s2">me not believe these things and how do</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.750" end="01:03:38.059" style="s2">we protect against those processes so if</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.809" end="01:03:42.740" style="s2">we want to have say a literal</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.059" end="01:03:45.470" style="s2">interpretation then we don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.740" end="01:03:48.640" style="s2">to doubt the literal interpretation then</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.470" end="01:03:53.660" style="s2">we start to have things memes like faith</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:55.910" style="s2">is something God likes and doubt which</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.660" end="01:03:57.319" style="s2">is another term for critical thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.910" end="01:03:58.760" style="s2">something that God doesn&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.319" end="01:04:01.460" style="s2">actually comes from the devil and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.760" end="01:04:06.380" style="s2">burn in hell for it and so the more that</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.460" end="01:04:08.299" style="s2">you just believe in the teaching the</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.380" end="01:04:11.000" style="s2">better your chances of heaven are and</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.299" end="01:04:13.670" style="s2">the more good you are and the more that</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.000" end="01:04:16.039" style="s2">you doubt it the more that Satan</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.670" end="01:04:18.920" style="s2">actually got to you right so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.039" end="01:04:20.270" style="s2">very strong protector meme against the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.920" end="01:04:21.799" style="s2">kind of critical thinking that could</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.270" end="01:04:25.849" style="s2">make you question the basis of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.799" end="01:04:30.440" style="s2">religion you&#39;ll also have other</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.849" end="01:04:32.359" style="s2">protector memes like if I believe this</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.440" end="01:04:33.589" style="s2">if I continue to believe this I get to</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.359" end="01:04:35.869" style="s2">keep having a family and a community</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.589" end="01:04:39.319" style="s2">that will take care of me if I&#39;m poor</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.869" end="01:04:41.029" style="s2">and if I&#39;m sick and you know will help</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.319" end="01:04:42.740" style="s2">me out in times of warfare and all those</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.029" end="01:04:45.049" style="s2">things and if I stop everybody will</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.740" end="01:04:47.630" style="s2">disown me or to various degree is that</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.049" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">like there will be direct implications</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.630" end="01:04:51.890" style="s2">to my life regarding the change in these</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:53.450" style="s2">beliefs and then again you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.890" end="01:04:56.059" style="s2">propagator memes we need to go on</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.450" end="01:04:58.220" style="s2">mission and share the good word with</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.059" end="01:05:01.730" style="s2">other people and convert them so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.220" end="01:05:04.309" style="s2">start to see a memetic ecosystem so now</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.730" end="01:05:06.740" style="s2">if I&#39;ve got propagator memes coming up</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.309" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">against some some people who also have</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.740" end="01:05:10.579" style="s2">protector memes from a previous complex</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:13.490" style="s2">then there&#39;s an evolution there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.579" end="01:05:16.579" style="s2">competition of which memes are more</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.490" end="01:05:17.010" style="s2">successful so then we look at the kind</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.579" end="01:05:18.930" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.010" end="01:05:20.460" style="s2">illusion of the types of mean complexes</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.930" end="01:05:22.470" style="s2">over time now there other people have a</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.460" end="01:05:25.890" style="s2">lot more expertise in this than I do and</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.470" end="01:05:27.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t have adequately detailed history</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.890" end="01:05:28.920" style="s2">to say this is a Rea historical</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.180" end="01:05:30.750" style="s2">narrative it&#39;s an example of the type of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.920" end="01:05:36.360" style="s2">thing that could happen right so ticket</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.750" end="01:05:38.460" style="s2">is that so say you look at the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.360" end="01:05:45.510" style="s2">of the concept of Hell right Hell as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.460" end="01:05:46.860" style="s2">mean in Western traditions so first say</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.510" end="01:05:49.590" style="s2">you take Eastern traditions like</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.860" end="01:05:51.060" style="s2">Hinduism or Buddhism they might have</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.590" end="01:05:52.260" style="s2">many different hell realms and nobody</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.060" end="01:05:54.600" style="s2">stays in any of them forever</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.260" end="01:05:56.880" style="s2">right like most of the interpretations</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.600" end="01:05:58.470" style="s2">have everybody gets to moksha or</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.880" end="01:06:00.210" style="s2">liberation eventually these are places</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.470" end="01:06:06.210" style="s2">that people go to learn things as part</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.210" end="01:06:08.100" style="s2">of the liberation path so and if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.210" end="01:06:10.530" style="s2">look at the descriptions of Hell at</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.100" end="01:06:15.120" style="s2">various points in Christianity hell got</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.530" end="01:06:18.150" style="s2">nastier as time went on and God also got</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.120" end="01:06:19.830" style="s2">more authoritarian and heaven got better</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.150" end="01:06:21.720" style="s2">and even if we go before that we look in</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.830" end="01:06:24.540" style="s2">early cultures and we see most early</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.720" end="01:06:26.100" style="s2">cultures were animistic right the spirit</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.540" end="01:06:27.870" style="s2">of the Buffalo and of the tree and of</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.100" end="01:06:31.530" style="s2">the river and there was the spirit of</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.870" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">everything and so spirit was radically</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.530" end="01:06:38.940" style="s2">decentralized and then there was an</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:40.680" style="s2">evolution because of evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.940" end="01:06:42.930" style="s2">pressures on memes that correspondent</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.680" end="01:06:45.390" style="s2">with little tribes living in nature too</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.930" end="01:06:48.330" style="s2">early civilizations there is an</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.390" end="01:06:50.130" style="s2">evolution to polytheism which is now not</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.330" end="01:06:52.770" style="s2">the spirit of everything but some</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.130" end="01:06:55.560" style="s2">smaller number of more powerful spirit</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.770" end="01:06:58.110" style="s2">or gods right so there&#39;s starts to be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.560" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">consolidation of power in the religion</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.110" end="01:07:01.500" style="s2">corresponding to a consolidation of</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:02.670" style="s2">actual power and the social structures</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.500" end="01:07:03.990" style="s2">that are happening and the way that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.670" end="01:07:06.690" style="s2">make sense of the world in the way that</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.990" end="01:07:08.790" style="s2">the religious idea actually supports the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.690" end="01:07:12.450" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re doing in the politics</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.790" end="01:07:15.200" style="s2">and like that right and then we end up</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.450" end="01:07:19.590" style="s2">going from polytheism to monotheism and</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.200" end="01:07:22.500" style="s2">if you think about control systems right</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.590" end="01:07:24.720" style="s2">some few being able to control a mini in</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.500" end="01:07:26.430" style="s2">ways that are better for the few than</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.720" end="01:07:28.230" style="s2">they are for the many and how you have</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.430" end="01:07:32.320" style="s2">systems of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.230" end="01:07:35.710" style="s2">institutional controller oppression so</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.320" end="01:07:40.780" style="s2">if we&#39;re having consolidation for having</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.710" end="01:07:42.850" style="s2">increasing power inequality in our</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.780" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">social systems and we want to justify</p>

<p begin="01:07:50.920" end="01:07:57.610" style="s2">reflect that is valuable those memes are</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.590" end="01:07:59.530" style="s2">gonna actually be adaptive to the social</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.610" end="01:08:01.510" style="s2">systems doing that right and if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.530" end="01:08:03.190" style="s2">think about an authority that controls a</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.510" end="01:08:06.130" style="s2">population with reward and Punishment</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.190" end="01:08:10.120" style="s2">and then we make we actually make a God</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.130" end="01:08:12.220" style="s2">in our image and we say okay well what</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.120" end="01:08:13.600" style="s2">would the infinite Authority be and what</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.220" end="01:08:14.920" style="s2">would infinite reward an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.600" end="01:08:18.570" style="s2">punishment and you just take all the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.920" end="01:08:21.730" style="s2">concepts to their logical zenith that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.570" end="01:08:25.090" style="s2">what Christianity did right so you have</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.730" end="01:08:27.090" style="s2">one all-powerful God beyond reproach</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.090" end="01:08:29.110" style="s2">with an infinite punishment and an</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.090" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">infinite eternal punishment an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.110" end="01:08:33.010" style="s2">reward if you&#39;re trying to look for</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:34.540" style="s2">maximum behavior mod that&#39;s what you end</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.010" end="01:08:36.430" style="s2">up coming to but it&#39;s almost like the</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.540" end="01:08:39.160" style="s2">strange attractor of a landscape that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.430" end="01:08:40.630" style="s2">just takes it to zenith right where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.160" end="01:08:43.300" style="s2">so terrifying once you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.630" end="01:08:45.670" style="s2">indoctrinated leave that belief system</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.300" end="01:08:48.600" style="s2">because if it because hell is so bad</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.670" end="01:08:51.550" style="s2">that any chance of it is so unacceptable</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.600" end="01:08:55.810" style="s2">that all kind of do Pascal&#39;s wager and</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.550" end="01:08:58.150" style="s2">just stay in it just because right now</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.810" end="01:09:00.190" style="s2">of course by believing that I might be</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.150" end="01:09:01.960" style="s2">going to the Muslim hell if they&#39;re true</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.190" end="01:09:03.580" style="s2">but that never got its hooks in me when</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.960" end="01:09:05.260" style="s2">I was young so I&#39;m not as afraid of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.580" end="01:09:06.340" style="s2">unless I grew up there in which case it</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.260" end="01:09:09.720" style="s2">has the hooks and I&#39;m much more afraid</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.340" end="01:09:09.720" style="s2">of that than I am of the Christian hell</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.320" end="01:09:15.610" style="s2">so we can see that you get an evolution</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.510" end="01:09:19.120" style="s2">of the gods getting more powerful and</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.610" end="01:09:22.050" style="s2">more authoritarian and more propagated</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.120" end="01:09:24.640" style="s2">and more ideology around propagation and</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.050" end="01:09:27.310" style="s2">reward and punishment and like those</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.640" end="01:09:29.980" style="s2">things that you would expect that that</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.310" end="01:09:32.590" style="s2">and specifically it&#39;s that the groups</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.980" end="01:09:34.540" style="s2">that instantiated those memes would have</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.590" end="01:09:37.700" style="s2">actually done better in a natural</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.540" end="01:09:42.180" style="s2">selection determined in more fair</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.700" end="01:09:46.430" style="s2">then and and also if I have a man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.180" end="01:09:49.109" style="s2">dominion over Earth ideology it says yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.430" end="01:09:50.069" style="s2">destroying the environment for us and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.109" end="01:09:51.960" style="s2">it&#39;s okay if we destroy the environment</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.069" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">because God&#39;s gonna come back and remake</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.960" end="01:09:59.400" style="s2">everything you know after purgatory</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.759" end="01:10:00.510" style="s2">anyways and and treating animals badly</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.400" end="01:10:02.490" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t matter because again</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.510" end="01:10:04.230" style="s2">dominion over like those ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.490" end="01:10:06.900" style="s2">actually going to be adaptive in terms</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.230" end="01:10:08.760" style="s2">of increasing the game of power even</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.900" end="01:10:10.980" style="s2">though they&#39;re if you take to zenith</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.760" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">that game itself terminates it destroys</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.980" end="01:10:16.380" style="s2">the whole world on the substrate that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:18.990" style="s2">depend upon so you want to think about</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.380" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">and we can see that there there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.990" end="01:10:22.380" style="s2">so we&#39;re looking at a kind of Christian</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:24.740" style="s2">worldview right but you can see that a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.380" end="01:10:30.350" style="s2">whole worldview of ideas comes up around</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.740" end="01:10:30.350" style="s2">supporting Trump or climate change or</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.740" end="01:10:36.780" style="s2">critical thinking and Dawkins kind of</p>

<p begin="01:15:46.459" end="01:15:50.780" style="s2">even appeal to them very much now some</p>

<p begin="01:15:56.090" end="01:16:03.079" style="s2">gonna be careful with this because I</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.499" end="01:16:06.019" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say names that will create</p>

<p begin="01:16:17.640" end="01:16:23.700" style="s2">diametrically opposite and but the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.230" end="01:16:24.960" style="s2">person who is saying yeah you know we</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.700" end="01:16:27.270" style="s2">all kind of are on the same page we all</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.960" end="01:16:29.130" style="s2">believe the same thing wanted to put on</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.270" end="01:16:30.780" style="s2">an event where we would all be there</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.130" end="01:16:36.780" style="s2">that she would sell lots of tickets for</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.780" end="01:16:38.730" style="s2">and and her orientation is what is</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.780" end="01:16:43.020" style="s2">actually going to optimize viewership</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.730" end="01:16:45.930" style="s2">and so how do we get people that are</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.020" end="01:16:47.610" style="s2">going to be engaging mix with people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.930" end="01:16:49.710" style="s2">are famous enough whatever talk to Mai&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.610" end="01:16:53.130" style="s2">viewership in and I was focused on what</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.710" end="01:16:56.460" style="s2">is actually true do we are we being</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.130" end="01:17:00.780" style="s2">earnest and what we&#39;re endeavoring to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.460" end="01:17:02.490" style="s2">here and her sense that we believe kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.780" end="01:17:04.110" style="s2">of the same thing because like we both</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.490" end="01:17:05.700" style="s2">talked about technology and we both</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.110" end="01:17:07.950" style="s2">talked about the future and we both kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.700" end="01:17:11.970" style="s2">of want stuff to be good and we both use</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.950" end="01:17:14.790" style="s2">the word exponential sometimes it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.970" end="01:17:16.620" style="s2">that she actually thinks that what I</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.790" end="01:17:20.340" style="s2">think is true or what this other person</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.620" end="01:17:22.740" style="s2">thinks is true she doesn&#39;t it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.340" end="01:17:25.860" style="s2">idea of true beliefs is not what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.740" end="01:17:28.190" style="s2">optimizing for what she&#39;s optimizing for</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.860" end="01:17:31.500" style="s2">is what&#39;s gonna get the most views and</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.190" end="01:17:34.290" style="s2">then there&#39;s a backfill a rational</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.500" end="01:17:38.310" style="s2">backfill that said that tries to</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.290" end="01:17:39.800" style="s2">rationalize that it&#39;s we we believe kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.310" end="01:17:43.440" style="s2">of the same thing or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.800" end="01:17:45.540" style="s2">but the orientation isn&#39;t even trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.440" end="01:17:47.460" style="s2">say do I believe what this person saying</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.540" end="01:17:50.990" style="s2">it&#39;s saying do I believe that I can make</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.460" end="01:17:50.990" style="s2">money on what this person is saying</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.650" end="01:18:06.110" style="s2">so you realize that we live so much in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.389" end="01:18:11.630" style="s2">simulated reality it like if I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.110" end="01:18:13.730" style="s2">venture capitalist I can make money on a</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.630" end="01:18:16.610" style="s2">product that is shittier than products</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.730" end="01:18:18.289" style="s2">that currently exist even though the</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.610" end="01:18:21.340" style="s2">market is supposed to be a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.289" end="01:18:25.010" style="s2">mechanism within the context of demand</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.340" end="01:18:26.179" style="s2">that there will be mutation right lots</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.010" end="01:18:28.369" style="s2">of different versions of the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.179" end="01:18:30.559" style="s2">product for the same service and that</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.369" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">the one that&#39;s actually the best at the</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.559" end="01:18:33.199" style="s2">best price is the one that the market</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:35.090" style="s2">will select for and it&#39;ll be upregulated</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.199" end="01:18:36.769" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of so the first part was</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.090" end="01:18:38.929" style="s2">mutation then survival selection and</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.769" end="01:18:40.940" style="s2">then good parts of a few different ones</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.929" end="01:18:42.380" style="s2">might combine and that&#39;s kind of mate</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.940" end="01:18:44.179" style="s2">selection right that&#39;s kind of how we</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.380" end="01:18:46.489" style="s2">think of markets as a sense making</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.179" end="01:18:48.079" style="s2">system lines of evolutionary theory but</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.489" end="01:18:49.699" style="s2">we all know that the best marketed</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.079" end="01:18:52.190" style="s2">product will oftentimes beat the actual</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.699" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">best product where the price of product</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.190" end="01:18:55.909" style="s2">development drops the price of marketing</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:18:57.380" style="s2">and customer acquisition goes up which</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.909" end="01:18:59.269" style="s2">means that it&#39;s a shittier product</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.380" end="01:19:01.639" style="s2">better marketed that means the sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.269" end="01:19:03.230" style="s2">making system is broken right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.639" end="01:19:04.880" style="s2">good sense making system so but as a</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.230" end="01:19:06.199" style="s2">venture capitalist I can invest in a</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.880" end="01:19:07.880" style="s2">company that I know is going to create a</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.880" end="01:19:14.510" style="s2">really successfully and maybe the</p>

<p begin="01:19:14.510" end="01:19:17.869" style="s2">point but I will have exited by then so</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.699" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">I don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.869" end="01:19:22.369" style="s2">long term I care that it&#39;s gonna market</p>

<p begin="01:19:39.199" end="01:19:43.219" style="s2">fundamentally novel II better in many</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.730" end="01:19:48.170" style="s2">cases right it&#39;s not only story but thus</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.219" end="01:19:49.820" style="s2">a story and so then my goal is to</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.170" end="01:19:51.980" style="s2">actually invest in someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.820" end="01:19:54.019" style="s2">ability to generate a distortion bubble</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.980" end="01:19:56.949" style="s2">that will pull enough people along that</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.019" end="01:19:59.329" style="s2">me as an early investor it&#39;ll lead to</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.949" end="01:20:01.280" style="s2">adoption of customers and other</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.329" end="01:20:04.550" style="s2">investors and then I exit before the</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.280" end="01:20:07.070" style="s2">distortion bubble pops right and so we</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.550" end="01:20:09.350" style="s2">can see like there are whole domains</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.070" end="01:20:11.200" style="s2">that are fairly decoupled from reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.350" end="01:20:15.100" style="s2">from base reality we&#39;re spinning</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.200" end="01:20:22.040" style="s2">simulated realities is the whole goal</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.100" end="01:20:23.630" style="s2">and so a lot of people her it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.040" end="01:20:27.560" style="s2">thing we have to pay attention to is</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.630" end="01:20:30.650" style="s2">that the cognitive complexity of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.560" end="01:20:33.050" style="s2">of the issues we face is just much</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.650" end="01:20:35.120" style="s2">faster than most people have time for</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.050" end="01:20:38.110" style="s2">then most people have training for and</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:41.180" style="s2">even vaster than we evolved to process</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.110" end="01:20:45.050" style="s2">so this idea of hyper objects right that</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.180" end="01:20:47.090" style="s2">there&#39;s not just plutonium but all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.050" end="01:20:49.010" style="s2">the plutonium or all of climate change</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.090" end="01:20:50.570" style="s2">or all of species extinction or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.010" end="01:20:52.280" style="s2">I can&#39;t actually observe that directly</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.570" end="01:20:56.870" style="s2">but I can infer it know that it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.280" end="01:20:59.240" style="s2">thing but how do I hold the cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.870" end="01:21:01.670" style="s2">complexity of any of those let alone all</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.240" end="01:21:04.280" style="s2">of them right as it is a very tricky</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.670" end="01:21:05.630" style="s2">thing and but I still have to feed my</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.280" end="01:21:08.720" style="s2">kids and pay the bills tomorrow</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.630" end="01:21:10.970" style="s2">and so the adaptive pressures on me are</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.720" end="01:21:13.780" style="s2">to focus on what I need to focus on in</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.970" end="01:21:15.980" style="s2">the very small and in the short term</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.780" end="01:21:19.610" style="s2">even though what I&#39;m doing because of</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.980" end="01:21:22.040" style="s2">globalized supply chains is affecting</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.610" end="01:21:24.260" style="s2">the global in the long term the idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.040" end="01:21:25.400" style="s2">think globally act locally most of us</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.260" end="01:21:26.810" style="s2">are doing the opposite right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.400" end="01:21:28.100" style="s2">actually thinking very locally about</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.810" end="01:21:30.260" style="s2">having actions that affect the world</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.100" end="01:21:32.900" style="s2">globally which means we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.260" end="01:21:35.270" style="s2">thinking on very short timescales fairly</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.900" end="01:21:37.850" style="s2">narcissistic self-indulgent and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.270" end="01:21:40.460" style="s2">timescales but with things that will</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.850" end="01:21:44.330" style="s2">have enduring and massive impact and</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.460" end="01:21:45.830" style="s2">that is a decoupling of scale it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.330" end="01:21:48.410" style="s2">decoupling of sense making and choice</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.830" end="01:21:50.390" style="s2">making a bunch of things but so for most</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.410" end="01:21:52.190" style="s2">people the idea of having the luxury of</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.390" end="01:21:53.330" style="s2">trying to make sense of the world is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.190" end="01:21:54.860" style="s2">something they don&#39;t even feel like they</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.330" end="01:21:57.080" style="s2">have because they&#39;re nose-down just</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.860" end="01:22:00.290" style="s2">trying to like do the next couple things</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.080" end="01:22:02.350" style="s2">they have to do and then other people</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.290" end="01:22:04.370" style="s2">who are actually trying to get ahead are</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.350" end="01:22:06.470" style="s2">optimizing for simulations and</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.370" end="01:22:08.090" style="s2">distortion bubbles rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.470" end="01:22:09.110" style="s2">make sense of the world so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.090" end="01:22:14.140" style="s2">of people who aren&#39;t actually even</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.110" end="01:22:14.140" style="s2">trying to make sense of the world now</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.100" end="01:22:21.380" style="s2">when I ask what is meaningful what is</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.250" end="01:22:25.160" style="s2">meaningful is going to be bound to what</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.380" end="01:22:28.940" style="s2">I think is real and if I give up on</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.160" end="01:22:33.890" style="s2">knowing what is real there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.940" end="01:22:36.110" style="s2">which I&#39;m giving up on the depth of my</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.890" end="01:22:38.540" style="s2">connectedness to what&#39;s meaningful so</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.110" end="01:22:40.610" style="s2">yes giving up on sense making there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.540" end="01:22:42.800" style="s2">is kind of an expression of a type of</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.610" end="01:22:49.340" style="s2">nihilism and it and it feeds into</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.800" end="01:22:50.990" style="s2">further nihilism first thing is I stop</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.340" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">trying to squish reality into a</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.990" end="01:22:56.750" style="s2">perspective this is super important and</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.080" end="01:22:59.510" style="s2">then anytime I have a perspective and I</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.750" end="01:23:01.790" style="s2">am defaulting into thinking of it as the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.510" end="01:23:05.090" style="s2">truth I become dubious of that in myself</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.790" end="01:23:06.380" style="s2">and they become curious about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.090" end="01:23:08.120" style="s2">partial truth in other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.380" end="01:23:10.850" style="s2">perspectives including the ones that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.120" end="01:23:14.540" style="s2">think are stupid and crazy right because</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.850" end="01:23:16.490" style="s2">they none of them have no signal even if</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.540" end="01:23:17.960" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a lot of noise so I want</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.490" end="01:23:19.670" style="s2">to say why do they think it is true well</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.960" end="01:23:21.980" style="s2">this bias that bias okayed all that and</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.670" end="01:23:24.140" style="s2">some perception mixed with the bias what</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.980" end="01:23:27.350" style="s2">is the per what are they perceiving that</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.140" end="01:23:29.000" style="s2">then with the bias is also there maybe</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.350" end="01:23:33.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not that much sense making but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.000" end="01:23:35.630" style="s2">something that&#39;s meaningful right so</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.650" end="01:23:37.010" style="s2">this is st. Francis&#39;s quote of seek more</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.630" end="01:23:40.670" style="s2">to understand them to be understood</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.010" end="01:23:42.500" style="s2">right seek first to understand that</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.670" end="01:23:45.080" style="s2">means actually seek to take different</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.500" end="01:23:48.290" style="s2">perspectives so the Hegelian dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.080" end="01:23:49.970" style="s2">is you&#39;ve got a thesis and then the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.290" end="01:23:52.490" style="s2">antithesis I actually want to try and</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.970" end="01:23:56.240" style="s2">take this perspective and construct this</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.490" end="01:23:59.450" style="s2">case and once I&#39;ve constructed both of</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.240" end="01:24:04.460" style="s2">these now I&#39;m stuck with either that I</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.450" end="01:24:08.210" style="s2">flip-flop between them or I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.460" end="01:24:11.120" style="s2">confused or I just claim paradox or the</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.210" end="01:24:13.010" style="s2">next step is thesis antithesis synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.120" end="01:24:15.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a higher-order truth it is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.010" end="01:24:17.480" style="s2">actually not paradoxical that reconciles</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.650" end="01:24:19.400" style="s2">them it just requires a higher order of</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.480" end="01:24:21.770" style="s2">complexity it&#39;s paradoxical within too</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.400" end="01:24:22.940" style="s2">low a level of complexity Einsteins you</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.770" end="01:24:25.090" style="s2">can&#39;t solve a problem at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.940" end="01:24:28.080" style="s2">problem at the level of complexity and</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.090" end="01:24:30.330" style="s2">so since to how</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.080" end="01:24:32.070" style="s2">is three-dimensional no two-dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.330" end="01:24:34.080" style="s2">picture will actually give me a solid</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.070" end="01:24:36.150" style="s2">sense on it if I&#39;m looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.080" end="01:24:39.090" style="s2">cylinder we talked about this the other</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.150" end="01:24:40.800" style="s2">night if I&#39;m trying to collapse the</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.090" end="01:24:42.150" style="s2">cylinder by a dimension and take a</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.800" end="01:24:44.520" style="s2">cylinder which is a three dimensional</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.150" end="01:24:46.020" style="s2">object and take a 2d slice of it if I</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.520" end="01:24:47.730" style="s2">got a cylinder like this a slice like</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.020" end="01:24:50.190" style="s2">this is a circle a slice like this is a</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.730" end="01:24:52.050" style="s2">rectangle in 2d circle and rectangle are</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.190" end="01:24:55.380" style="s2">mutually exclusive descriptions of a</p>

<p begin="01:24:55.380" end="01:25:00.080" style="s2">the other has no straight lines and no</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.880" end="01:25:03.810" style="s2">corners if I try to say well it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.080" end="01:25:06.630" style="s2">that just makes no sense at all right if</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.810" end="01:25:08.730" style="s2">I say well it must be part of both so</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.630" end="01:25:10.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a rounded rectangle well that it</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.730" end="01:25:12.660" style="s2">has no truth at all but I have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.770" end="01:25:15.450" style="s2">actually be able to construct a higher</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.660" end="01:25:17.430" style="s2">dimensional space in which rectangle</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.450" end="01:25:19.080" style="s2">nough sand circle misfit together in a</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.430" end="01:25:22.440" style="s2">way that is makes perfect sense called</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.080" end="01:25:23.820" style="s2">it cylinder but this is what a level of</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.440" end="01:25:26.090" style="s2">consciousness that isn&#39;t the level that</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.820" end="01:25:28.920" style="s2">caused the problem the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.090" end="01:25:31.050" style="s2">partiality of perspective that can</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.920" end="01:25:34.350" style="s2">create then a basis for conflict right</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.050" end="01:25:37.260" style="s2">so then there is a higher order that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.350" end="01:25:39.750" style="s2">able to reconcile those and so seeking</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.260" end="01:25:42.720" style="s2">that and this is where you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.750" end="01:25:44.250" style="s2">seeking clarity more than simplicity</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.720" end="01:25:51.110" style="s2">because the simplicity can happen</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.250" end="01:25:54.960" style="s2">through reduction right and typically</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.110" end="01:25:56.640" style="s2">the synthesis comes from novel insight</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.960" end="01:25:58.290" style="s2">that neither the thesis nor the</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.640" end="01:26:02.370" style="s2">antithesis held it&#39;s not just well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.290" end="01:26:04.470" style="s2">a little bit of both so a couple</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.370" end="01:26:06.780" style="s2">examples let&#39;s say we take kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.470" end="01:26:08.400" style="s2">political left and political radiology</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.780" end="01:26:09.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a gazillion examples and what we</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.400" end="01:26:11.400" style="s2">call the political left and right today</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.810" end="01:26:16.100" style="s2">might seem actually quite different than</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.400" end="01:26:19.410" style="s2">what it was in the past so let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.100" end="01:26:22.260" style="s2">kind of what had previous to recently</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.410" end="01:26:25.140" style="s2">been kind of some essential ideas and</p>

<p begin="01:26:25.140" end="01:26:30.480" style="s2">kind of have this Republican right</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.630" end="01:26:33.000" style="s2">oriented idea of wanting to empower the</p>

<p begin="01:26:33.000" end="01:26:39.360" style="s2">the individual and more individualistic</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.780" end="01:26:41.310" style="s2">and so smaller government less social</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.360" end="01:26:41.640" style="s2">services more empowering of those who</p>

<p begin="01:26:52.230" end="01:26:56.430" style="s2">well and here it&#39;s saying the collective</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.690" end="01:26:58.290" style="s2">is actually created by the individual so</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.430" end="01:27:00.120" style="s2">we want to empower the individuals that</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.290" end="01:27:01.320" style="s2">are creative and take agency because</p>

<p begin="01:27:01.320" end="01:27:05.550" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the gist over here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.690" end="01:27:07.140" style="s2">like well but the individuals are being</p>

<p begin="01:27:07.140" end="01:27:10.890" style="s2">they&#39;re born into by the whole and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.670" end="01:27:12.420" style="s2">even though I can&#39;t find that one story</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.890" end="01:27:13.830" style="s2">of that one guy who pulled themselves up</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.420" end="01:27:15.180" style="s2">by the bootstraps in the ghetto there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.830" end="01:27:16.680" style="s2">a whole lot more people that succeeded</p>

<p begin="01:27:16.680" end="01:27:21.570" style="s2">into South Central and so let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:23.130" style="s2">better environments that actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.570" end="01:27:24.720" style="s2">condition better people because there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:27:36.560" end="01:27:45.120" style="s2">also problems right so there can be a</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.670" end="01:27:47.310" style="s2">right oriented perspective that says hey</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.120" end="01:27:48.660" style="s2">look if we set up social services in</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.310" end="01:27:52.560" style="s2">welfare and whatever we actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.660" end="01:27:54.420" style="s2">condition shittier people who are less</p>

<p begin="01:27:58.770" end="01:28:06.810" style="s2">what and we make people who are doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.430" end="01:28:08.310" style="s2">badly still do well and that actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.810" end="01:28:09.780" style="s2">kind of down regulates the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.310" end="01:28:11.400" style="s2">pressure in the whole system like why</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.780" end="01:28:12.960" style="s2">would we want to do that and of course</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.400" end="01:28:15.210" style="s2">over here we can have a kind of left</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.960" end="01:28:17.820" style="s2">perspective that says yeah but some</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.210" end="01:28:19.320" style="s2">people are getting ahead using shared</p>

<p begin="01:28:28.800" end="01:28:31.260" style="s2">entrepreneurial it just means they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.160" end="01:28:47.160" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have money or</p>

<p begin="01:30:15.540" end="01:30:20.070" style="s2">making more comfortable but shittier</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.770" end="01:30:22.320" style="s2">people right and the way that we incent</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.070" end="01:30:23.850" style="s2">individuals over here in sense people</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.320" end="01:30:25.739" style="s2">who are entrepreneurial but by</p>

<p begin="01:31:22.499" end="01:31:30.329" style="s2">an antithesis right and if you if you</p>

<p begin="01:32:46.139" end="01:32:50.939" style="s2">so the dialectic process of saying like</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.260" end="01:32:54.329" style="s2">okay well how do I see the partial truth</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.939" end="01:32:56.459" style="s2">here construct this fully and then how</p>

<p begin="01:33:06.840" end="01:33:11.309" style="s2">them so that&#39;s kind of a dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.929" end="01:33:13.170" style="s2">process and it might not just be to</p>

<p begin="01:33:18.689" end="01:33:21.670" style="s2">is a process that I would love to see</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.670" end="01:33:24.100" style="s2">people start</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.670" end="01:33:25.780" style="s2">to sing out for sense-making of whenever</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.100" end="01:33:28.239" style="s2">they&#39;re talking with someone start by</p>

<p begin="01:33:30.340" end="01:33:34.570" style="s2">value and what people are saying not</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.199" end="01:33:36.040" style="s2">just the wrongness but then don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.570" end="01:33:37.900" style="s2">holistically throw out what they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:33:37.900" end="01:33:43.480" style="s2">be able to separate that there is signal</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.880" end="01:33:46.420" style="s2">and noise and then be able to say if I</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.480" end="01:33:48.250" style="s2">see signal from a number of sources how</p>
<p begin="01:33:46.420" end="01:33:52.750" style="s2">does that fit together into higher order</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.250" end="01:33:55.480" style="s2">perspective this this is another sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.750" end="01:33:58.360" style="s2">making process you mentioned emotion and</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.480" end="01:34:01.330" style="s2">vulnerability as key components of sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:58.360" end="01:34:03.690" style="s2">making could you that may seem a little</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.330" end="01:34:05.440" style="s2">bit counterintuitive to people can you</p>
<p begin="01:34:03.690" end="01:34:09.460" style="s2">explain what you mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.440" end="01:34:11.760" style="s2">if I want to make sense of the world</p>
<p begin="01:34:09.460" end="01:34:13.810" style="s2">well and I&#39;m gonna engage in some</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:15.310" style="s2">communication processes with other</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.810" end="01:34:20.920" style="s2">people to make sense of the world with</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.310" end="01:34:22.719" style="s2">some collective sense making then I want</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.920" end="01:34:26.560" style="s2">them to share true information with me</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.719" end="01:34:28.600" style="s2">to not dis inform nor withhold so how do</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.560" end="01:34:31.270" style="s2">I create the trust and psychological</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.600" end="01:34:33.640" style="s2">safety for them to do that well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.270" end="01:34:36.760" style="s2">probably gonna have to do that too and</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.640" end="01:34:38.890" style="s2">so how do we create mutual trust and</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.760" end="01:34:40.120" style="s2">psychologic safety that we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.890" end="01:34:41.199" style="s2">to use the information that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.120" end="01:34:43.810" style="s2">sharing with each other and game</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.199" end="01:34:51.040" style="s2">theoretic ways with each other that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.810" end="01:34:53.140" style="s2">huge part and if people don&#39;t have some</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.040" end="01:34:55.060" style="s2">spaces and some relationships where they</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.140" end="01:34:58.060" style="s2">feel like they can actually share fully</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.060" end="01:35:02.140" style="s2">openly honestly and feel trust in that</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.060" end="01:35:04.090" style="s2">their sense making is gonna be radically</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.140" end="01:35:06.250" style="s2">curtailed right to what they can just do</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.090" end="01:35:08.560" style="s2">on their own and without anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.250" end="01:35:15.310" style="s2">ability to help error correct them with</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.560" end="01:35:18.610" style="s2">full sharing also one of the sources of</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.310" end="01:35:22.210" style="s2">bias is identifying with what I believe</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.610" end="01:35:23.410" style="s2">because it because I&#39;m identifying with</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.210" end="01:35:27.190" style="s2">part of an in-group that believes that</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.410" end="01:35:29.650" style="s2">thing or because I am special or smart</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.190" end="01:35:33.650" style="s2">or right or whatever for believing that</p>
<p begin="01:35:29.650" end="01:35:36.480" style="s2">thing so the the impulse to be right</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.650" end="01:35:39.719" style="s2">means that I won&#39;t seek to understand</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.480" end="01:35:43.440" style="s2">other perspectives and so if I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.719" end="01:35:44.909" style="s2">actually seek to understand the truth</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.440" end="01:35:48.420" style="s2">value in other perspectives like</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.909" end="01:35:50.699" style="s2">earnestly try and get what they are</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.420" end="01:35:54.150" style="s2">seeing what where they&#39;re coming from I</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.699" end="01:35:55.800" style="s2">have to stop seeing it the way that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.150" end="01:35:59.420" style="s2">seeing it for a little while and I also</p>
<p begin="01:35:55.800" end="01:36:01.800" style="s2">have to completely suspend debate and</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.420" end="01:36:03.929" style="s2">narrative warfare and the impulse to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.800" end="01:36:08.239" style="s2">right and all of that and so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.929" end="01:36:12.329" style="s2">deeper human connection that&#39;s involved</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.239" end="01:36:15.420" style="s2">there&#39;s also something there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:36:12.329" end="01:36:19.130" style="s2">psychological process that almost seems</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.420" end="01:36:21.300" style="s2">like a spiritual process where for me to</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.130" end="01:36:23.820" style="s2">really try and get where you&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.300" end="01:36:26.460" style="s2">from on a topic I have to really take</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.820" end="01:36:27.869" style="s2">your perspective well what is it in me</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.460" end="01:36:30.690" style="s2">that is taking your perspective because</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.869" end="01:36:32.249" style="s2">it&#39;s not my perspective right it it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:30.690" end="01:36:34.289" style="s2">actually having to drop the way that I</p>
<p begin="01:36:32.249" end="01:36:35.699" style="s2">see things to really try and see it the</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.289" end="01:36:38.099" style="s2">way that you see things to make sense of</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.699" end="01:36:40.019" style="s2">it so that means that it is some come</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.099" end="01:36:42.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a capacity in me that can</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.019" end="01:36:45.199" style="s2">witness my perspective that can also</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.210" end="01:36:47.309" style="s2">witness your perspective but it is</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.199" end="01:36:48.900" style="s2">deeper than the current perspective I</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.309" end="01:36:50.159" style="s2">have and we all know we can change our</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.900" end="01:36:52.739" style="s2">beliefs and there&#39;s still something that</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.159" end="01:36:55.019" style="s2">is us so there is a us Ness that is</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.739" end="01:36:56.639" style="s2">deeper than the belief system to be able</p>
<p begin="01:36:55.019" end="01:36:58.349" style="s2">to really try to make sense of someone</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.639" end="01:37:00.570" style="s2">else I actually have to move into that</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.349" end="01:37:02.960" style="s2">level of self that is deeper than belief</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.570" end="01:37:02.960" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="01:37:05.140" end="01:37:10.580" style="s2">what do you hope that people will get</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.130" end="01:37:13.490" style="s2">from it I would like if they are looking</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.580" end="01:37:15.530" style="s2">at their own biases and saying okay</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.490" end="01:37:16.940" style="s2">where do I have emotional needs that are</p>
<p begin="01:37:15.530" end="01:37:19.610" style="s2">affecting what I believe where do I have</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.940" end="01:37:22.310" style="s2">in-group out-group stuff happening where</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.610" end="01:37:24.710" style="s2">am I actually doing disinformation where</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.310" end="01:37:26.390" style="s2">you know like all what are my cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:37:24.710" end="01:37:27.560" style="s2">biases well how do I even know well let</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.390" end="01:37:29.990" style="s2">me go look up the list of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.560" end="01:37:32.780" style="s2">biases and start to inventory them keeps</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.990" end="01:37:33.950" style="s2">talking about epistemology like and what</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.780" end="01:37:35.450" style="s2">the axioms are I don&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.950" end="01:37:37.400" style="s2">the fuck that means how do I actually go</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.450" end="01:37:39.410" style="s2">explore what the right steps of logical</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.400" end="01:37:41.240" style="s2">process an axiom are can i empower my</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.410" end="01:37:45.800" style="s2">own learning so if people felt inspired</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.240" end="01:37:47.600" style="s2">to learn how to learn better and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.800" end="01:37:50.690" style="s2">inspired to create relationships with</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.600" end="01:37:52.700" style="s2">other people where they actually do care</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.690" end="01:37:56.570" style="s2">about understanding what is true and</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.700" end="01:37:58.730" style="s2">real so that they can also have a better</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.570" end="01:38:00.110" style="s2">relationship with what is meaningful and</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.730" end="01:38:02.030" style="s2">being able to make choices line to that</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.110" end="01:38:03.170" style="s2">and where they&#39;re endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.030" end="01:38:04.940" style="s2">understand what is true and real</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.170" end="01:38:06.800" style="s2">together and also endeavoring to create</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.940" end="01:38:10.300" style="s2">an intact information ecology where no</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.800" end="01:38:14.420" style="s2">one is dis informing anybody which is as</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.300" end="01:38:18.650" style="s2">much or even more an emotional process</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.420" end="01:38:19.970" style="s2">as it is a cognitive one because to</p>

<p begin="01:38:19.970" end="01:38:26.420" style="s2">ecology involves vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.100" end="01:38:28.010" style="s2">intimacy that&#39;s what happens getting out</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.420" end="01:38:29.510" style="s2">of a game theoretic context where I say</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.010" end="01:38:30.980" style="s2">oh our well-beings are shared well what</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.510" end="01:38:34.580" style="s2">if you defect on me I have to actually</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.980" end="01:38:38.030" style="s2">create a situation and Trust to be able</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.580" end="01:38:40.610" style="s2">to share real information so then I get</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.030" end="01:38:42.890" style="s2">to see where my own wounds make it make</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.610" end="01:38:45.860" style="s2">me incapable of trusting or of or</p>

<p begin="01:38:45.860" end="01:38:49.610" style="s2">would be things that I would be happy if</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.030" end="01:38:53.480" style="s2">people looked at the emotional and</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.610" end="01:38:58.010" style="s2">cognitive and overwhelmed by time and</p>

<p begin="01:39:51.380" end="01:40:01.280" style="s2">understood and be happy about that well</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.680" end="01:40:04.060" style="s2">if we look at the framework of sharing</p>

<p begin="01:40:26.030" end="01:40:33.860" style="s2">and so again if I have two different</p>

<p begin="01:40:55.790" end="01:40:59.930" style="s2">happens this is corporate politics</p>
<p begin="01:40:57.740" end="01:41:02.600" style="s2">inside of corporations this happens</p>
<p begin="01:40:59.930" end="01:41:04.730" style="s2">everywhere so as long as we have</p>

<p begin="01:41:18.860" end="01:41:24.440" style="s2">and with others and with the Commons so</p>
<p begin="01:41:21.530" end="01:41:27.370" style="s2">then we will compete with each other for</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.440" end="01:41:32.390" style="s2">a lot of things</p>
<p begin="01:41:27.370" end="01:41:34.340" style="s2">and we will engage in in at the worst</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.390" end="01:41:35.810" style="s2">case physical warfare kinetic warfare</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.340" end="01:41:37.640" style="s2">but will mostly engage in economic</p>
<p begin="01:41:35.810" end="01:41:39.340" style="s2">warfare competing against each other and</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.640" end="01:41:41.450" style="s2">at the cost of the Commons and</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.340" end="01:41:42.800" style="s2">information and narrative warfare also</p>
<p begin="01:41:41.450" end="01:41:46.310" style="s2">at the cost of the information Commons</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.800" end="01:41:49.969" style="s2">and each other so to really get over</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.310" end="01:41:51.980" style="s2">that we would need to couple or we need</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.969" end="01:41:55.640" style="s2">to create alignment between agencies</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.980" end="01:41:57.830" style="s2">right between what you have intention to</p>
<p begin="01:41:55.640" end="01:41:59.210" style="s2">do and what is also in my well-being and</p>
<p begin="01:41:57.830" end="01:42:01.219" style="s2">vice versa which means that we would</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.210" end="01:42:02.930" style="s2">need to have more coupling between our</p>
<p begin="01:42:01.219" end="01:42:04.670" style="s2">well-beings which means we would need to</p>

<p begin="01:42:04.670" end="01:42:14.420" style="s2">provisioning and I will say that the the</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.860" end="01:42:18.110" style="s2">type of system that could do that</p>
<p begin="01:42:14.420" end="01:42:21.940" style="s2">adequately has never been proposed in</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.110" end="01:42:24.590" style="s2">any kind of major way because obviously</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.940" end="01:42:29.750" style="s2">none of the systems ever proposed so far</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.590" end="01:42:31.280" style="s2">or tried do that but if we have a rival</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.750" end="01:42:33.080" style="s2">risk relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.280" end="01:42:34.640" style="s2">information will be part of that rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:42:33.080" end="01:42:36.380" style="s2">and will damage the information ecology</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.640" end="01:42:38.420" style="s2">in the same way we damage the physical</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.380" end="01:42:43.310" style="s2">environment or or each other</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.420" end="01:42:48.410" style="s2">kinetically so that&#39;s a big ask</p>
<p begin="01:42:43.310" end="01:42:51.710" style="s2">right so our balance sheets are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:42:48.410" end="01:42:53.719" style="s2">at the foundation of what create</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.710" end="01:42:55.520" style="s2">rivalries dynamics and this is at the</p>

<p begin="01:43:00.469" end="01:43:04.219" style="s2">we still have private nation states that</p>

<p begin="01:43:32.960" end="01:43:39.050" style="s2">well if we look at all of the neurons in</p>

<p begin="01:46:12.590" end="01:46:16.250" style="s2">that neither of them had on their own</p>
<p begin="01:46:13.790" end="01:46:18.920" style="s2">that&#39;s fucking amazing to think about</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.250" end="01:46:20.870" style="s2">right and this is true like your brain</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.920" end="01:46:22.820" style="s2">is a whole processes information that no</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.870" end="01:46:24.469" style="s2">individual of the types that no</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.820" end="01:46:27.170" style="s2">individual neuron or sub neural networks</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.469" end="01:46:29.450" style="s2">are processing and individual neurons</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.170" end="01:46:30.860" style="s2">can get something wrong but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.450" end="01:46:34.010" style="s2">error correcting processes that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.860" end="01:46:35.690" style="s2">propagate that but but the processes do</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.010" end="01:46:37.910" style="s2">propagate the true information so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.690" end="01:46:41.090" style="s2">like well how the fuck does it work that</p>
<p begin="01:46:37.910" end="01:46:43.070" style="s2">we get that the information processing</p>
<p begin="01:46:41.090" end="01:46:46.100" style="s2">that each of the parts are doing goes</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.070" end="01:46:49.790" style="s2">through a communication protocol that</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.100" end="01:46:52.010" style="s2">error corrects the false parts and also</p>
<p begin="01:46:49.790" end="01:46:53.420" style="s2">gives parallax on the true parts where</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.010" end="01:46:55.460" style="s2">we get not only the truth of all the</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.420" end="01:46:56.780" style="s2">parts but a way of binding that together</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.460" end="01:47:02.090" style="s2">for synergistically higher-order</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.780" end="01:47:03.950" style="s2">information the cells our sense making</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.090" end="01:47:05.120" style="s2">and they&#39;re communicating they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.950" end="01:47:06.830" style="s2">signaling with each other right a</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.120" end="01:47:08.630" style="s2">hormone is a communication a</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.830" end="01:47:10.700" style="s2">neurotransmitter like those are all</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.630" end="01:47:12.140" style="s2">signaling processes but they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.700" end="01:47:14.060" style="s2">a game theoretic relationship with each</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.140" end="01:47:16.340" style="s2">other right they actually have a</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.060" end="01:47:18.800" style="s2">mutually symbiotic relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.340" end="01:47:21.080" style="s2">each other so they are supporting each</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.800" end="01:47:22.820" style="s2">other sense making in that way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.080" end="01:47:24.440" style="s2">the lungs obviously do better if the</p>
<p begin="01:47:22.820" end="01:47:26.380" style="s2">heart&#39;s doing better as opposed to doing</p>
<p begin="01:47:24.440" end="01:47:29.120" style="s2">worse if they the heart is doing better</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.380" end="01:47:31.270" style="s2">so if we just start to kind of imagine</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.120" end="01:47:33.770" style="s2">into what type of communication</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.270" end="01:47:38.660" style="s2">processes protocols would have to happen</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.770" end="01:47:40.670" style="s2">between humans that allowed for error</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.660" end="01:47:43.940" style="s2">correction on any individuals</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.670" end="01:47:45.950" style="s2">perceptions but allowed the true parts</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.940" end="01:47:47.450" style="s2">of everyone&#39;s perceptions to be</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.950" end="01:47:49.219" style="s2">separated from the air parts and then</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.450" end="01:47:50.360" style="s2">all the true parts to be synthesized at</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.219" end="01:47:52.760" style="s2">a higher order of complexity than</p>
<p begin="01:47:50.360" end="01:47:54.290" style="s2">individuals could do on their own when</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.760" end="01:47:55.610" style="s2">we think about the civilization of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.290" end="01:47:58.599" style="s2">future and the collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.610" end="01:48:01.280" style="s2">of the future we think about that one</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.599" end="01:48:03.380" style="s2">rebel wisdom is a new sense making</p>
