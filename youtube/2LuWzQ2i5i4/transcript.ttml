<p begin="00:01:32.700" end="00:01:35.490" style="s2">there&#39;s the dog barking in the</p>

<p begin="00:01:35.490" end="00:01:37.870" style="s2">myself because I want to see if this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:40.959" style="s2">Auto played on Facebook&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.870" end="00:01:40.959" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.700" end="00:01:49.509" style="s2">I&#39;m fairly sure it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.320" end="00:01:58.160" style="s2">that gives people incentives to put</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.810" end="00:02:01.370" style="s2">their videos on Facebook which is what</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.160" end="00:02:05.540" style="s2">facebook wants yeah no absolutely their</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.370" end="00:02:07.780" style="s2">profit over purpose which they want</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.540" end="00:02:10.460" style="s2">people to see videos but not on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.780" end="00:02:11.740" style="s2">so yeah I think before it was before</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.460" end="00:02:15.380" style="s2">they have the ability to go live on</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.740" end="00:02:19.400" style="s2">Facebook they don&#39;t play in your</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.380" end="00:02:22.310" style="s2">interview but knowing that be videos and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.400" end="00:02:24.140" style="s2">stuff yet was since we&#39;re we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.310" end="00:02:25.850" style="s2">on Facebook is specifically in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.140" end="00:02:27.860" style="s2">project space it probably makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.850" end="00:02:31.490" style="s2">do both so I just wanted to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.860" end="00:02:37.490" style="s2">and see that&#39;s a good as of this one and</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.490" end="00:02:42.110" style="s2">tomorrow will be the same thing for this</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.490" end="00:02:45.980" style="s2">week see how it goes on Facebook we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.110" end="00:02:47.600" style="s2">just not auto-create on I mean there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.980" end="00:02:49.850" style="s2">lot of reasons to go pure YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.600" end="00:02:51.320" style="s2">because then it&#39;s easier to with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.850" end="00:02:53.900" style="s2">interaction is through New York like</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.320" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">that so anyway it&#39;s probably enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.900" end="00:02:58.600" style="s2">talking about all that boring tech stuff</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:03.950" style="s2">that&#39;s kinda it is a board meeting</p>

<p begin="00:04:25.400" end="00:04:28.730" style="s2">not sure why you would join right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.540" end="00:04:30.680" style="s2">unless you&#39;re just wanting to</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:33.680" style="s2">think yeah but it will become more</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.330" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">important as we actually start to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.680" end="00:04:39.830" style="s2">things and offer reasons for people to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:41.300" style="s2">join so there starts a conflict or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.830" end="00:04:45.950" style="s2">something happens that will have more of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.300" end="00:04:48.080" style="s2">like joining process now it&#39;s like show</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.950" end="00:04:49.910" style="s2">I can participate see how it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.080" end="00:04:53.060" style="s2">align with you does it align with us</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.910" end="00:04:56.290" style="s2">does it work show participate as much as</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.060" end="00:04:58.940" style="s2">you as you want so that is basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.290" end="00:05:01.010" style="s2">what I think you actually says is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.940" end="00:05:04.030" style="s2">okay you enjoy the Facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.010" end="00:05:09.350" style="s2">participating the events that&#39;s it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.030" end="00:05:11.540" style="s2">because our Fridays you know Fridays at</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.350" end="00:05:13.550" style="s2">12 p.m. PST behold we means alternating</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.540" end="00:05:15.290" style="s2">between the itea cafe for projects and</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.550" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">the board meetings for creating the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.290" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">project together tech Saturdays at 9:00</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:22.430" style="s2">a.m. PST we have project roundtables</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:23.960" style="s2">people with projects or looking for one</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.430" end="00:05:27.080" style="s2">come to share what they have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.960" end="00:05:29.780" style="s2">or they could use help with these</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.080" end="00:05:31.940" style="s2">sessions are all held live on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.780" end="00:05:35.150" style="s2">and Facebook so as soon as I wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.940" end="00:05:37.880" style="s2">I didn&#39;t follow it up with links to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.150" end="00:05:39.710" style="s2">participate on Facebook we also hold</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.880" end="00:05:41.660" style="s2">project raising these would requested oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.710" end="00:05:43.880" style="s2">that&#39;s so I did post a link to</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.660" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">participate for sure a part of it is on</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.880" end="00:05:47.930" style="s2">YouTube since anyone can watch I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:49.539" style="s2">post links participate as the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.930" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">point is not to have random people</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.539" end="00:05:55.370" style="s2">another reason to go is it then it</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:58.130" style="s2">catches people&#39;s eye and then people can</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.370" end="00:06:02.780" style="s2">write it up in that way that made sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.130" end="00:06:04.370" style="s2">I think one of the alternatives which I</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.780" end="00:06:06.530" style="s2">mean it&#39;s kind of I think a big change</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.370" end="00:06:10.520" style="s2">but might be worth it it&#39;s changing from</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.530" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">I think it&#39;s a group to a page cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.520" end="00:06:14.510" style="s2">I don&#39;t have any of these problems with</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:16.640" style="s2">the the wiki Lipson one because that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.510" end="00:06:18.919" style="s2">think a page and so like I can stream to</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.640" end="00:06:21.190" style="s2">it I can you know I can comment as it</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.919" end="00:06:23.870" style="s2">and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.190" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">so we may want to explore that at some</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.870" end="00:06:28.970" style="s2">point if we&#39;re trying to just improve I</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:30.320" style="s2">don&#39;t pay for a group for a reason we</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:32.630" style="s2">just want people from that group to come</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.320" end="00:06:34.190" style="s2">participate and it&#39;s II don&#39;t I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.630" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily want you know my</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.190" end="00:06:37.160" style="s2">random high school people to see and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:40.010" style="s2">we&#39;re doing this to come and participate</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.160" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like people who you&#39;re either in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.010" end="00:06:46.250" style="s2">game B or doing something very game be</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:48.830" style="s2">adjacent and wanted right do not think</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.250" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">for users though like the difference</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.830" end="00:06:52.970" style="s2">between a page in a group is almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:54.140" style="s2">negligible to the average person but for</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.970" end="00:06:59.990" style="s2">some reason and Facebook on the backend</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.140" end="00:07:05.390" style="s2">huge difference we should page versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.990" end="00:07:07.070" style="s2">group I feel like a page is more just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.390" end="00:07:09.950" style="s2">company and you&#39;re like a customer</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.070" end="00:07:14.810" style="s2">following a brand versus a group is like</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.950" end="00:07:18.410" style="s2">you&#39;re part of it just in the name but I</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.810" end="00:07:20.270" style="s2">agree I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a page as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:22.430" style="s2">brand and together tech we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.270" end="00:07:24.140" style="s2">build a brand no I know but like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.430" end="00:07:26.090" style="s2">even know if page allows you to have</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.140" end="00:07:27.200" style="s2">multiple admin&#39;s and make announcements</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.090" end="00:07:28.940" style="s2">and you don&#39;t I mean like I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.200" end="00:07:30.770" style="s2">algorithms even though maybe when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.940" end="00:07:33.110" style="s2">live it&#39;s better it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.770" end="00:07:34.580" style="s2">better when everyone else is posting to</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.110" end="00:07:37.160" style="s2">also here I mean like we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.580" end="00:07:40.580" style="s2">turn it more into a group and a page you</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.160" end="00:07:44.510" style="s2">get for them was the experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.580" end="00:07:46.460" style="s2">in it right if like us I mean you liking</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.510" end="00:07:49.640" style="s2">it and get in following versus a group</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.460" end="00:07:52.130" style="s2">that we&#39;re all part of and contributing</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.640" end="00:07:55.820" style="s2">to even if people aren&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.130" end="00:07:56.500" style="s2">contributing right ok good that makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.820" end="00:07:58.880" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.500" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">and yeah I know that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.880" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">reasons for each just it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.000" style="s2">to see the two different sides because</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.020" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">it&#39;s been way easier to stream to wait</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.000" end="00:08:08.860" style="s2">till wiki election you using stream yard</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:13.700" style="s2">do you have a lot of people like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.140" end="00:08:16.520" style="s2">parents will like your page on Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.700" end="00:08:19.700" style="s2">are debris collection I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.520" end="00:08:22.610" style="s2">like 30 now many people who like it</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.700" end="00:08:24.260" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t did you advertise it like</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.610" end="00:08:25.460" style="s2">how did you get 30 people to like it or</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.260" end="00:08:29.240" style="s2">did you just go live and then people</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.460" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">found you sorry no I&#39;m talking about 30</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.240" end="00:08:33.560" style="s2">people liking like the page four were</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:36.439" style="s2">collection</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.560" end="00:08:38.300" style="s2">all right my question is how did those</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.439" end="00:08:44.480" style="s2">30 people find you did you just a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.300" end="00:08:46.339" style="s2">like mostly from before right where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.480" end="00:08:48.199" style="s2">was like where I would like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.339" end="00:08:49.850" style="s2">when I did the Kickstarter for wiki</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.199" end="00:08:52.040" style="s2">election and I posted on my personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.850" end="00:08:54.860" style="s2">page like you know friends and family</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.040" end="00:08:57.139" style="s2">and stuff go and join and then I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.860" end="00:08:58.610" style="s2">like I think possibly some people from</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.139" end="00:09:00.889" style="s2">game B and like occasional people</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.610" end="00:09:07.220" style="s2">showing up and finding it and I assume</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.889" end="00:09:09.800" style="s2">it&#39;s probably from the game B stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.220" end="00:09:13.759" style="s2">what is it that worked for the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.800" end="00:09:16.579" style="s2">election page that you don&#39;t think works</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.759" end="00:09:19.490" style="s2">for them together tech just stream yards</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.579" end="00:09:21.139" style="s2">streaming to it right like they&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.490" end="00:09:23.209" style="s2">you&#39;re setting up the channels in stream</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.139" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">yard it sort of explains like hey by the</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.209" end="00:09:26.300" style="s2">way you&#39;re streaming to a page you won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:28.850" style="s2">be able to do this this this and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.300" end="00:09:30.170" style="s2">like you know I get I think it&#39;s harder</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.850" end="00:09:34.279" style="s2">for it to like where that person has to</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.170" end="00:09:36.410" style="s2">like yeah I think that&#39;s a like stream</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.279" end="00:09:38.600" style="s2">yard or something and then we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.410" end="00:09:40.850" style="s2">see there yeah like it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.600" end="00:09:44.089" style="s2">the whole connection between stream yard</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.850" end="00:09:47.990" style="s2">and Facebook is easier and better if</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.089" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">you&#39;re a group a patient said of a group</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.990" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">yeah oh hey brands and does sound like</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:58.279" style="s2">for-profit companies but not groups</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:01.399" style="s2">grassroots no don&#39;t happening or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.279" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">just a glitch that&#39;s the a thank you I</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.399" end="00:10:06.259" style="s2">don&#39;t even know where we necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:08.360" style="s2">want to use it what we want to add to it</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.259" end="00:10:12.110" style="s2">but it&#39;s a good place as we hear Carmen</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.360" end="00:10:14.540" style="s2">questions to have one place to store</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.110" end="00:10:17.689" style="s2">them he turned us like for internal use</p>

<p begin="00:10:48.469" end="00:10:52.819" style="s2">talk about our solution raising or we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.869" end="00:10:54.949" style="s2">did talk about macking maybe that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.819" end="00:10:59.239" style="s2">kind of a together tech project I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.949" end="00:11:00.799" style="s2">hunted together tech project or anyone</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.239" end="00:11:04.249" style="s2">else has anything they&#39;d like to add for</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.799" end="00:11:05.869" style="s2">more of like how do we discuss the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.249" end="00:11:08.149" style="s2">matter project or move the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.869" end="00:11:09.619" style="s2">forward whatever anyone else would like</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.149" end="00:11:15.079" style="s2">to add to the agenda even if they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.619" end="00:11:18.769" style="s2">know the agenda existed I&#39;m psychic you</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.079" end="00:11:22.789" style="s2">know absolutely curious about how do you</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.769" end="00:11:25.519" style="s2">see the together tech being not</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.789" end="00:11:31.549" style="s2">identical but very connected to the meta</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.519" end="00:11:37.639" style="s2">project because it seems that they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.549" end="00:11:43.339" style="s2">kind of the same thing yeah there are</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.639" end="00:11:44.689" style="s2">two ladies it&#39;s just if we see a matter</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.339" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">project people in camp you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.689" end="00:11:47.869" style="s2">talking about together attack it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:49.729" style="s2">it&#39;s just the name of the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.869" end="00:11:51.679" style="s2">because together tech isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.729" end="00:11:54.049" style="s2">game B even if it&#39;s 90% gave me people</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.679" end="00:11:56.659" style="s2">it&#39;s the idea that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.049" end="00:11:57.889" style="s2">understand game BD KP game be right to</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.659" end="00:11:58.939" style="s2">know that we need a better world that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.889" end="00:12:01.609" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to create all new in</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.939" end="00:12:03.109" style="s2">solutions that are not it&#39;s kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.609" end="00:12:04.729" style="s2">of the important part so it was already</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.109" end="00:12:05.779" style="s2">had the name together attack and then we</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.729" end="00:12:08.839" style="s2">were kind of like we need a name for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.779" end="00:12:13.269" style="s2">meta project and became the two are an</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.839" end="00:12:16.389" style="s2">analogous yeah so it&#39;s kind of like our</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.269" end="00:12:19.129" style="s2">flavor of you know the like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.389" end="00:12:20.659" style="s2">figure out how we can help projects move</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.129" end="00:12:22.789" style="s2">forward as a group the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.659" end="00:12:24.109" style="s2">it started out talking as the matter</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.789" end="00:12:26.239" style="s2">project cuz it&#39;s a project of about</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.109" end="00:12:27.979" style="s2">projects and as Julie said it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.239" end="00:12:29.779" style="s2">became up we were trying to brand it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.979" end="00:12:31.579" style="s2">Jubilee have the name together tech and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.779" end="00:12:34.489" style="s2">it fits quite well with what is trying</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.579" end="00:12:38.809" style="s2">to do so but yeah they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.489" end="00:12:40.969" style="s2">synonyms all three it&#39;s so yellow here</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.809" end="00:12:42.949" style="s2">at state another project game B projects</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.969" end="00:12:45.619" style="s2">and together tech it&#39;s all basically the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.949" end="00:12:47.299" style="s2">same thing yeah and then fortunately</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.619" end="00:12:50.209" style="s2">fortunately together tech is also</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.299" end="00:12:53.029" style="s2">synonymous with like a technology</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.209" end="00:12:54.769" style="s2">cooperative in general that something</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.029" end="00:12:56.720" style="s2">that like humanity owns together the</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.769" end="00:12:58.249" style="s2">members own together because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.720" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">have a project and number itself isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.249" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:05.060" style="s2">now it&#39;s also like how to get to a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:06.380" style="s2">technology cooperative we all own part</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.060" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">of it is creating it from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.380" end="00:13:09.380" style="s2">which is solution raising you to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:11.030" style="s2">figuring out a process do that and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.380" end="00:13:12.920" style="s2">also bringing people&#39;s projects together</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.030" end="00:13:14.690" style="s2">to great bring them in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.920" end="00:13:17.090" style="s2">creating common solutions so we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.690" end="00:13:19.130" style="s2">of attacking it from all angles at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.090" end="00:13:21.220" style="s2">same time and together attack is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.130" end="00:13:25.430" style="s2">somewhat the umbrella for that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.220" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">somewhat hard to contain conversation</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.430" end="00:13:28.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s like our version of game P and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:30.860" style="s2">how to create it without opening game be</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.940" end="00:13:32.510" style="s2">right without being like can&#39;t these are</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.860" end="00:13:34.970" style="s2">isn&#39;t anyone who&#39;s involved in it you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.510" end="00:13:36.590" style="s2">like it&#39;s you know whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.970" end="00:13:38.150" style="s2">involved in together attack or not right</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.590" end="00:13:41.660" style="s2">you don&#39;t necessarily know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.150" end="00:13:44.420" style="s2">going to give you so it&#39;s like the first</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.660" end="00:13:49.990" style="s2">step first step or the fractal fractal</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.420" end="00:13:54.770" style="s2">thing that is supposed to hopefully mmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.990" end="00:13:57.700" style="s2">yeah I think so mmm-hmm that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.770" end="00:14:00.440" style="s2">our attempt at it as Jubilee said</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.700" end="00:14:02.510" style="s2">intentionally not divorcing ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.440" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">from from game B but like we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.510" end="00:14:07.100" style="s2">separate entity that we aren&#39;t claiming</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:09.200" style="s2">to follow every game B principle 100%</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.100" end="00:14:11.690" style="s2">it&#39;s more about us trying to move it</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.200" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">forward what does it take to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.690" end="00:14:16.910" style="s2">start to work on projects together and</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:18.950" style="s2">figure that stuff out without getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.910" end="00:14:21.170" style="s2">bogged down in the mire of well is it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.950" end="00:14:23.150" style="s2">you know you know these three things but</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.170" end="00:14:26.660" style="s2">not that one game B element so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.150" end="00:14:30.440" style="s2">game B projects forward that are even</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.660" end="00:14:32.990" style="s2">like slightly game B but we established</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.440" end="00:14:38.080" style="s2">that the baby is not supposed to be mm</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.990" end="00:14:41.690" style="s2">put in words so make sense sorry</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.080" end="00:14:46.190" style="s2">it&#39;s not supposed to be defined and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.690" end="00:14:48.110" style="s2">know describe this exactly which get</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.190" end="00:14:49.430" style="s2">hard when you&#39;re trying to make like an</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.110" end="00:14:50.750" style="s2">organization around it cuz you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.430" end="00:14:53.240" style="s2">have to define what you&#39;re doing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.750" end="00:14:55.130" style="s2">what you&#39;re about so it&#39;s like yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.240" end="00:14:57.170" style="s2">attempt it like here&#39;s the flavor that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.130" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">we think it&#39;ll take as far as what a</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.170" end="00:15:01.370" style="s2">game B ish organization can look like</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.650" style="s2">but we&#39;re almost certainly going to make</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.370" end="00:15:05.750" style="s2">choices that the gay B community doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.650" end="00:15:07.820" style="s2">fully uh agree with and they&#39;re welcomed</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.750" end="00:15:10.490" style="s2">you know give feedback and or start</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.820" end="00:15:12.550" style="s2">their own coops you know we can work</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.490" end="00:15:14.050" style="s2">together and figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.550" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">we different how are we the same helping</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.050" end="00:15:21.430" style="s2">we help each other etc it bring together</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">individuals hopefully with sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.430" end="00:15:26.290" style="s2">not how to improve their sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:27.640" style="s2">then how do like projects come together</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.290" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">to work because that&#39;s just where we</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.640" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">started people in game B happen to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:34.690" style="s2">projects or not gonna let go and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:36.640" style="s2">become game B is their project it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.690" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">they want game B to somehow shift and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.640" end="00:15:44.170" style="s2">focus on their project or they just</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:46.450" style="s2">realize that they can go at this point</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.170" end="00:15:49.660" style="s2">if game B went away cuz there was some</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.450" end="00:15:52.450" style="s2">scandal or some bad media we don&#39;t cease</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.660" end="00:15:54.339" style="s2">to exist and similarly you go away we in</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.450" end="00:15:58.690" style="s2">no way tarnish game B right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.339" end="00:16:00.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very obviously a that P so that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.690" end="00:16:01.510" style="s2">can&#39;t talk about it but also can you be</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.250" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">able to talk about things it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.510" end="00:16:04.810" style="s2">who put it out like how do we get to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">better world where does their version of</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.810" end="00:16:07.240" style="s2">a better world</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:14.440" style="s2">what is our path there what is all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.240" end="00:16:16.269" style="s2">the things that are more nebulous and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.440" end="00:16:17.740" style="s2">think like if because I tend to think in</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.269" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">a lot of things that sort of game a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.740" end="00:16:21.399" style="s2">terms because I mean I still work in</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:23.649" style="s2">gaming and there&#39;s parts of that I like</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.399" end="00:16:25.750" style="s2">I think what we&#39;re at now is what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.649" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">call indie gaming thought leadership so</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.750" end="00:16:29.829" style="s2">it&#39;s not like actually selling anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.190" end="00:16:31.720" style="s2">or doing necessarily the main purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.829" end="00:16:33.550" style="s2">the organization but kind of starting to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.720" end="00:16:36.640" style="s2">show like okay the people involved are</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.550" end="00:16:38.320" style="s2">thinking about these areas that&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.640" end="00:16:41.500" style="s2">to be what that organization is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:43.540" style="s2">you know skill that and focused on and</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.500" end="00:16:45.130" style="s2">that kind of thing right so for us we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.540" end="00:16:47.230" style="s2">doing these you know open meetings and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.130" end="00:16:49.870" style="s2">doing this sort of open thought process</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.230" end="00:16:51.459" style="s2">on what does it mean you know to have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.870" end="00:16:54.130" style="s2">game B project or to have that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.459" end="00:16:56.320" style="s2">project and what are the things that it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.130" end="00:16:58.209" style="s2">emphasizes and you know what it&#39;s trust</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.320" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">me two people having these public</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.209" end="00:17:02.589" style="s2">conversations so anyone else even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:04.750" style="s2">they would never join together tech or a</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.589" end="00:17:08.110" style="s2">co-op conviction or access to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.750" end="00:17:09.520" style="s2">information and at some point as Julie</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.110" end="00:17:12.790" style="s2">mentioned the end goal is for it to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.520" end="00:17:15.550" style="s2">like an actual you know a community</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.790" end="00:17:18.550" style="s2">owned co-op that actually owns tech like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.550" end="00:17:19.809" style="s2">you know yeah if it it owns tech but as</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.550" end="00:17:23.949" style="s2">a co-op instead of as a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.809" end="00:17:25.890" style="s2">entity but that part would be optional</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.949" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">like I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.890" end="00:17:31.080" style="s2">personally I&#39;m you know I&#39;ve got wiki</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:32.760" style="s2">election I&#39;m also part of together tech</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.080" end="00:17:35.580" style="s2">guys I think the to work well together</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.760" end="00:17:37.530" style="s2">and like that&#39;s an example of I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.580" end="00:17:41.850" style="s2">you know going to merge wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.530" end="00:17:43.620" style="s2">with together tech anytime soon but it</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.850" end="00:17:45.630" style="s2">helps kind of answer questions it like</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.620" end="00:17:47.370" style="s2">for example Bentley might have at the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.630" end="00:17:49.290" style="s2">same time for reason schooler so we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.370" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">go on under one umbrella try to solve</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.290" end="00:17:53.940" style="s2">all together and then I&#39;ll take my</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.440" style="s2">learnings didn&#39;t leave or think is you</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.940" end="00:17:58.230" style="s2">know you know everyone here well I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.440" end="00:18:00.179" style="s2">take their own and then hopefully we</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.230" end="00:18:04.020" style="s2">report back and that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.179" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">learning happens yes and from technical</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.020" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">point of view for all the projects it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:14.160" style="s2">would be because they have other lives</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">be go and small so for all the projects</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.160" end="00:18:20.900" style="s2">if they had api&#39;s so they could talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:23.510" style="s2">together mmm and be useful to each other</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.900" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">that would be also something that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:31.020" style="s2">yesterday younger mmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.160" end="00:18:35.940" style="s2">mapping meeting and especially after we</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.020" end="00:18:37.980" style="s2">discussed some with James some more</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.940" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">details about how such a system could</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.980" end="00:18:43.860" style="s2">look like and at some point for example</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">we mentioned that it would be useful to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.860" end="00:18:53.130" style="s2">have a set of values defined somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:55.350" style="s2">as like a list of possible values that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.130" end="00:19:02.450" style="s2">people might have and adhere to and feel</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.350" end="00:19:07.290" style="s2">connected to and for some reason well I</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.450" end="00:19:10.169" style="s2">record what our friend Saddam is doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.290" end="00:19:12.630" style="s2">and his political project and it has the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.169" end="00:19:17.820" style="s2">set of values ready basically and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.630" end="00:19:21.600" style="s2">meant to like drill down the values</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.820" end="00:19:27.750" style="s2">problem and define and if that project</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:32.190" style="s2">had an API so other projects that could</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.750" end="00:19:36.360" style="s2">need its Freddie somewhere so exists</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.190" end="00:19:37.080" style="s2">already and yeah ApS I&#39;m good right</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.610" end="00:19:46.110" style="s2">together tech provides a spot for you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.220" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">know so for example it might provide</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.110" end="00:19:50.220" style="s2">something sort of like you know user</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:52.680" style="s2">management and user registration or that</p>

<p begin="00:19:52.680" end="00:19:56.010" style="s2">example says already has his I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">together tech we got reason score we got</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.010" end="00:19:59.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll have all these different apps if we</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:00.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t want especially people in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.310" end="00:20:03.360" style="s2">game be space you might be trying out</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.710" end="00:20:05.160" style="s2">multiple versions of them if we want it</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.360" end="00:20:06.870" style="s2">like share user registration and say</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.160" end="00:20:08.310" style="s2">like you you know you create a single</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.870" end="00:20:10.620" style="s2">user and then you can use that same user</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.310" end="00:20:13.710" style="s2">anywhere in this ecosystem kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.620" end="00:20:15.390" style="s2">you know a Google login or Facebook yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.710" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">we&#39;re but it&#39;s creating something</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.390" end="00:20:21.090" style="s2">separate because those names come with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:25.290" style="s2">lot of baggage you know security and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.090" end="00:20:27.390" style="s2">privacy justifiably yeah the kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.290" end="00:20:30.120" style="s2">alternative through something like an</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.390" end="00:20:35.010" style="s2">API starting with possibly a user list</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.120" end="00:20:39.810" style="s2">or just shared data of some sort so one</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.010" end="00:20:48.900" style="s2">thing James of course has its own little</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.810" end="00:20:52.380" style="s2">project interesting and we discussed</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.900" end="00:20:56.190" style="s2">something like because there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.380" end="00:20:59.580" style="s2">products but so many projects because</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.190" end="00:21:03.440" style="s2">people like different styles of you is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.580" end="00:21:06.140" style="s2">and they expect different thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.440" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">visualize they have different needs and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.140" end="00:21:12.890" style="s2">it&#39;s good and I guess that&#39;s because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:17.880" style="s2">have so many of the other projects but</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.890" end="00:21:20.130" style="s2">one interesting thing is the data in in</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.880" end="00:21:24.120" style="s2">the backend might be exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.130" end="00:21:24.750" style="s2">and maybe that even has to be exactly</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.120" end="00:21:29.340" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.750" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">I mean data can be true or mmm not and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.340" end="00:21:38.390" style="s2">if we had a set of true data on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:43.140" style="s2">subject then all the projects we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.390" end="00:21:45.050" style="s2">existing in the space could use the same</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.140" end="00:21:47.390" style="s2">data but is not it in a different way or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.050" end="00:21:50.790" style="s2">focus on different aspects of the data</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.390" end="00:21:57.140" style="s2">so there is also that it was interesting</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.790" end="00:22:03.080" style="s2">because it showed why how we can have</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.140" end="00:22:07.010" style="s2">the variety of interfaces and users but</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.080" end="00:22:13.640" style="s2">working on the same different set of</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.010" end="00:22:16.920" style="s2">facts of data and independent of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.640" end="00:22:17.250" style="s2">interfaces right and is there ready to</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.920" end="00:22:20.370" style="s2">be used</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.250" end="00:22:22.710" style="s2">I see yeah I mean I think wherever</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.370" end="00:22:23.910" style="s2">possible we should definitely try to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.710" end="00:22:25.530" style="s2">that right so if we have three or four</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.910" end="00:22:27.210" style="s2">projects all building up the same data</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.530" end="00:22:29.310" style="s2">set if one falls away</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.210" end="00:22:30.660" style="s2">we don&#39;t lose that data that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.310" end="00:22:31.830" style="s2">aerial they can all fall away and a new</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.660" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">one can pop up and it would have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.830" end="00:22:35.760" style="s2">library of data that it could have</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:38.130" style="s2">access to I think something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.760" end="00:22:39.390" style="s2">together attack like all of the little</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.130" end="00:22:40.770" style="s2">like we need to figure out have fun</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.390" end="00:22:42.240" style="s2">together tech right and fund the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.770" end="00:22:43.590" style="s2">individual projects we&#39;re actually out</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.240" end="00:22:45.270" style="s2">of place so we can actually accept</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.590" end="00:22:50.520" style="s2">funding because we haven&#39;t worked that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.270" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">out right right but to develop a commons</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.520" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">even if only in idea that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:58.590" style="s2">comments right so whether we collections</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:01.170" style="s2">working on their project individually or</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.590" end="00:23:02.910" style="s2">not what are they what would they</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.170" end="00:23:05.370" style="s2">benefit from being in the commons and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.910" end="00:23:08.940" style="s2">what can they give back to the Commons</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.370" end="00:23:10.890" style="s2">right right so my example is a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.940" end="00:23:14.550" style="s2">my talk about like having different</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.890" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">recipe apps right once again ones but it</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.550" end="00:23:18.750" style="s2">dissipates the energy if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.220" style="s2">common pool of information the user the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.750" end="00:23:22.230" style="s2">recipes the ingredients they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.220" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">attritional information and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.230" end="00:23:27.060" style="s2">have your vegan app and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:28.620" style="s2">even if that app goes away the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.060" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">informations there the data is still</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.620" end="00:23:32.130" style="s2">there the connections are still there</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.830" style="s2">you might be you know join the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.130" end="00:23:37.140" style="s2">recipe group as a vegan subset or join</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.830" end="00:23:39.720" style="s2">it like there&#39;s a lot more power there</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.140" end="00:23:40.890" style="s2">if each individual project is creating</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.720" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">our database then they want on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.890" end="00:23:44.970" style="s2">database they want to profit off the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:47.820" style="s2">database it has to be done with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.970" end="00:23:50.850" style="s2">Commons in mind a bit like to some</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.820" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">degree again what is Becky like she</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.850" end="00:23:53.580" style="s2">could what could they use from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:54.810" style="s2">Commons and what could they give back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.580" end="00:23:56.790" style="s2">the Commons and that we could figure out</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.810" end="00:23:58.590" style="s2">what is the most powerful to create in</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.790" end="00:24:00.270" style="s2">the Commons and what we want to get back</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.590" end="00:24:01.800" style="s2">maybe with the election give something</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.270" end="00:24:05.740" style="s2">back that has nothing to do with wiki</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.800" end="00:24:07.450" style="s2">like write the back I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.740" end="00:24:08.620" style="s2">people&#39;s postal code information if</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.450" end="00:24:10.750" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to give it back right</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.620" end="00:24:12.909" style="s2">like whenever that happens to be that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.750" end="00:24:14.140" style="s2">not information that connects to all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.909" end="00:24:16.779" style="s2">that right if it connects all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.140" end="00:24:18.850" style="s2">information and as the user hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.779" end="00:24:20.830" style="s2">I&#39;m in control I own data there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.850" end="00:24:25.270" style="s2">higher level of information it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.830" end="00:24:28.059" style="s2">available and then the UI having the UI</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.270" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">be very different based on the diversity</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.059" end="00:24:31.929" style="s2">including even having that vegan recipe</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:33.490" style="s2">site right rather it&#39;s the developer</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.929" end="00:24:38.230" style="s2">that makes unique or the user that makes</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.490" end="00:24:44.740" style="s2">it unique the comments is common right</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.230" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">oh yeah I just realized that talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.740" end="00:24:49.720" style="s2">about fractally displaying and gathering</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:51.820" style="s2">data it&#39;s not even about in within a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.720" end="00:24:56.789" style="s2">single project that this place a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.820" end="00:25:00.279" style="s2">fracture of information it can also mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.789" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">like totally different projects same</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.279" end="00:25:09.370" style="s2">thing about factory displacement Stan</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:11.380" style="s2">I&#39;m like no and using the same users</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.370" end="00:25:13.270" style="s2">across all these different apps you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.380" end="00:25:14.710" style="s2">assuming people opt into all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.270" end="00:25:16.630" style="s2">different areas could be so insanely</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.710" end="00:25:18.549" style="s2">powerful is then if you cease to have a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.630" end="00:25:19.690" style="s2">recipe app and a you know travel app and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.549" end="00:25:20.830" style="s2">this and that you&#39;d be like okay well</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.690" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">this person is eating this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.830" end="00:25:29.559" style="s2">shopping here they&#39;re doing this they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">going there they can know so much and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.559" end="00:25:33.190" style="s2">you can control it but part of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.630" style="s2">reason to have that information stored</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.190" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">because if it&#39;s just for you I already</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.630" end="00:25:39.190" style="s2">know where I ate something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:40.929" style="s2">if as a community we say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.190" end="00:25:42.820" style="s2">don&#39;t take this box if you want open up</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.929" end="00:25:45.309" style="s2">these areas and then I have you know an</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.820" end="00:25:47.190" style="s2">algorithm or a I stretch a look at this</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.309" end="00:25:50.620" style="s2">disconnected stuff and start to learn</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.190" end="00:25:53.409" style="s2">and it&#39;s being done under a and open</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.620" end="00:25:55.299" style="s2">system and beany like being helpful</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.409" end="00:25:57.100" style="s2">not-for-profit is the whole thing like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.299" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">if it was for-profit who gets the money</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.100" end="00:26:05.140" style="s2">no one so why would you mm-hmm but that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:07.299" style="s2">sort of disconnected information is</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.140" end="00:26:10.600" style="s2">where you can get some just crazy</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.299" end="00:26:12.850" style="s2">powerful stuff everything that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.600" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">exist in the realm of trying to sell you</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.070" style="s2">was enough of us that would somehow</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.440" end="00:27:27.340" style="s2">a very privacy compatible which is my</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.830" end="00:27:30.220" style="s2">phone knows only very limited set of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.340" end="00:27:33.460" style="s2">facts about other phones it comes in</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.220" end="00:27:37.080" style="s2">contact with and I get the information</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.460" end="00:27:41.529" style="s2">that someone I was nearby I was close to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.080" end="00:27:44.409" style="s2">is quarantined and it&#39;s it looks on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.529" end="00:27:46.740" style="s2">surface it looks really like okay it</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:50.889" style="s2">makes sense it doesn&#39;t store</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.740" end="00:27:53.139" style="s2">informational but then there is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.889" end="00:27:58.029" style="s2">central place controlled by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.139" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">government basically and it so appears</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.029" end="00:28:05.429" style="s2">that they can be called the data that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:08.470" style="s2">not supposed to be colored by anyone and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.429" end="00:28:10.990" style="s2">there is sample CBO you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.470" end="00:28:17.019" style="s2">tracking people aren&#39;t doing the China</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.990" end="00:28:19.870" style="s2">in here so this whole thing is quite the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.019" end="00:28:22.029" style="s2">test in human sovereignty and technology</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.870" end="00:28:24.340" style="s2">and governance in all the way because</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.029" end="00:28:26.590" style="s2">there&#39;s like this somewhat diabolically</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.340" end="00:28:27.970" style="s2">opposed side the left versus the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.590" end="00:28:30.519" style="s2">and they look very similar in this code</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.970" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">but weird like the right oh my god we</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.519" end="00:28:32.900" style="s2">need you behind</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.940" style="s2">it was like we need to close down the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.900" end="00:28:36.290" style="s2">border like it becomes very like you</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.940" end="00:28:38.660" style="s2">wanna look like the other side cuz</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.290" end="00:28:40.280" style="s2">you&#39;re your highest value you need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.660" end="00:28:41.090" style="s2">live and like what which one does that</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.280" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.090" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the point of this that joint now</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:49.250" style="s2">there&#39;s people who like our like our</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">governments are trying to take out our</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.250" end="00:28:52.670" style="s2">rights and you&#39;re letting them you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:54.830" style="s2">staying inside your sheep oh you sheeple</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.670" end="00:28:56.150" style="s2">get out and protest and take back our</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.830" end="00:28:58.460" style="s2">governments the other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.150" end="00:28:59.870" style="s2">like governance or maybe inept but</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.460" end="00:29:02.060" style="s2">they&#39;re doing the best they can this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.870" end="00:29:06.230" style="s2">the best we can do right now there is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.060" end="00:29:07.940" style="s2">like and they&#39;re both right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.230" end="00:29:10.100" style="s2">what do we do if though if the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.940" end="00:29:11.720" style="s2">conspiracy theory whichever one is right</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.100" end="00:29:14.060" style="s2">right that if the government this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.720" end="00:29:17.300" style="s2">orchestrated they&#39;re doing it to install</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.060" end="00:29:20.120" style="s2">5g to whatever whatever whenever get our</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.300" end="00:29:22.940" style="s2">fascist apps installed put inject chips</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.120" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">into our arms I don&#39;t stop that how do</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:26.360" style="s2">we see if that&#39;s true and if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:28.840" style="s2">other side and we think that their</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.360" end="00:29:32.210" style="s2">benevolent whatever there&#39;s naturally</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.840" end="00:29:34.820" style="s2">like that it is just a virus what is our</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.210" end="00:29:37.610" style="s2">best course of action then like what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.820" end="00:29:39.320" style="s2">how do we best help how do we best do</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.610" end="00:29:41.900" style="s2">either inside instead of our community</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.320" end="00:29:43.460" style="s2">which is true what actually works how</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.900" end="00:29:44.870" style="s2">would we actually track ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.460" end="00:29:46.940" style="s2">because it&#39;s not the government keeps</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.870" end="00:29:48.680" style="s2">calling them on our phone for sure if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.940" end="00:29:50.900" style="s2">want that if there&#39;s a vaccine coming</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.680" end="00:29:53.240" style="s2">down the line what would get people who</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.900" end="00:29:54.680" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna vaccinate to vaccinate we</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.240" end="00:29:56.060" style="s2">need to have those conversations now</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.680" end="00:29:57.920" style="s2">because it&#39;s not leaving if they get</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.060" end="00:30:02.060" style="s2">hands of Bill Gates it&#39;s not leaving it</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.920" end="00:30:04.040" style="s2">I think at that point you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.060" end="00:30:05.870" style="s2">would you get a vaccine but also what</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.040" end="00:30:07.970" style="s2">would you need to know or in order to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.870" end="00:30:11.300" style="s2">voluntarily install that app like what</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.970" end="00:30:12.800" style="s2">would probably it&#39;s not made by a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.300" end="00:30:14.180" style="s2">government that&#39;s probably important one</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.800" end="00:30:16.220" style="s2">probably it&#39;s not made by for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.180" end="00:30:18.290" style="s2">corporations you start to build up okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.220" end="00:30:20.540" style="s2">if we think that this thing is important</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.290" end="00:30:21.970" style="s2">right like okay so if you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.540" end="00:30:24.200" style="s2">whole thing is fake and blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.970" end="00:30:25.730" style="s2">what would it take for you to actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.200" end="00:30:26.990" style="s2">believe it when the government says that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.730" end="00:30:29.900" style="s2">you need to quarantine yourself what</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.990" end="00:30:32.090" style="s2">would that look like and vice versa yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.900" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">exactly and if you&#39;re right what would</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.090" end="00:30:37.640" style="s2">this look like like all of it like</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:39.070" style="s2">there&#39;s the plan plan demmick that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.640" end="00:30:41.810" style="s2">going around</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.070" end="00:30:44.809" style="s2">like i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s true or not we</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.810" end="00:30:47.190" style="s2">need to stop having it like</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.809" end="00:30:49.469" style="s2">documentary is our highest level of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.190" end="00:30:51.599" style="s2">media yeah we need a way to understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.469" end="00:30:53.969" style="s2">what the is going on without</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.599" end="00:30:55.589" style="s2">relying on one person&#39;s narrative and</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.969" end="00:30:57.649" style="s2">put it into a video and then sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.589" end="00:31:00.629" style="s2">us in this britain&#39;s diva it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.649" end="00:31:02.700" style="s2">want to know what in this is real what</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.629" end="00:31:04.379" style="s2">if this isn&#39;t real and then actually be</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.700" end="00:31:07.919" style="s2">able to like have a conversation without</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.379" end="00:31:09.719" style="s2">instead of just you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.919" end="00:31:11.339" style="s2">idiot I because I did the research and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.719" end="00:31:14.929" style="s2">put it come to the same conclusion as I</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.339" end="00:31:18.229" style="s2">did so you&#39;re clearly an idiot okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.929" end="00:31:21.029" style="s2">summarize the entire political discourse</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.229" end="00:31:22.950" style="s2">your idiot because you know you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.029" end="00:31:24.899" style="s2">get access to 16 information that I have</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.950" end="00:31:26.129" style="s2">and then reach the same conclusions from</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.899" end="00:31:29.609" style="s2">the information you probably didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.129" end="00:31:32.609" style="s2">so so you&#39;re an idiot yeah one of my</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.609" end="00:31:34.259" style="s2">favorite people on Facebook or there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.609" end="00:31:37.289" style="s2">people in real life and they happened to</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.259" end="00:31:39.269" style="s2">be on Facebook posted that a rebuttal</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.289" end="00:31:41.009" style="s2">for seven points against planned emic</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.269" end="00:31:43.619" style="s2">and if you continue to post it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.009" end="00:31:45.209" style="s2">pleads on friends me I was like is this</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.619" end="00:31:47.669" style="s2">such an alignment with who you are as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.209" end="00:31:49.169" style="s2">person I don&#39;t really like who&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.669" end="00:31:52.320" style="s2">would I read those seven and come to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.169" end="00:31:53.789" style="s2">same conclusion as you like no no this</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.320" end="00:31:55.200" style="s2">makes sense some of this is like and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.789" end="00:31:56.609" style="s2">then someone rebuttals that well then</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.200" end="00:32:03.209" style="s2">you should like it&#39;s like it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.609" end="00:32:04.919" style="s2">a way to Cory there isn&#39;t even one</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.209" end="00:32:09.089" style="s2">narrative about it and there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.919" end="00:32:13.109" style="s2">aspects that it&#39;s how to make one sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.089" end="00:32:16.429" style="s2">because yes there seems to be the virus</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.109" end="00:32:21.389" style="s2">yes it&#39;s real but when you read about</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.429" end="00:32:25.320" style="s2">this specific kind of viruses it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.389" end="00:32:29.849" style="s2">a little stretch like it&#39;s I think 7th</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.320" end="00:32:34.200" style="s2">of this family that appeared in in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.849" end="00:32:38.759" style="s2">world and it just happens to be so far</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.200" end="00:32:41.639" style="s2">the most lethal which is not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.759" end="00:32:44.219" style="s2">there is no next virus in line just</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.639" end="00:32:48.359" style="s2">waiting I already heard some user</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.219" end="00:32:51.570" style="s2">there&#39;s no strength of this thing and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.359" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">it&#39;s already spreading so yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.570" end="00:32:57.559" style="s2">that the origins</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:33:00.859" style="s2">who knows people accuse oh no it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.559" end="00:33:02.359" style="s2">China notice us no it&#39;s whatever it came</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.859" end="00:33:03.679" style="s2">from animals it came from some</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.359" end="00:33:07.359" style="s2">laboratory it escaped</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.679" end="00:33:12.950" style="s2">it was released yeah doesn&#39;t even matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.359" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">if we cannot do anything about it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.950" end="00:33:17.419" style="s2">don&#39;t think it matters if it escapes</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:21.789" style="s2">from a laboratory we know that military</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.419" end="00:33:23.629" style="s2">is working on some stuff like this okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.789" end="00:33:29.419" style="s2">not much we can do about it</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.629" end="00:33:32.509" style="s2">right now I think so the epidemic itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.419" end="00:33:37.399" style="s2">how problematic is that given that flu</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.509" end="00:33:40.909" style="s2">and cancer and whatever else is more</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.399" end="00:33:46.369" style="s2">lethal than this one so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.909" end="00:33:49.999" style="s2">problem and then regardless of of all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.369" end="00:33:54.169" style="s2">this when the pandemic was announced</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.999" end="00:33:56.299" style="s2">like everyone in power just jumped with</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.169" end="00:33:58.369" style="s2">joy and said okay this is what we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.299" end="00:34:01.369" style="s2">going to use it they just started using</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.369" end="00:34:04.549" style="s2">it for everything and allows the vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.369" end="00:34:07.159" style="s2">in my country sometimes they have</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.549" end="00:34:10.280" style="s2">nothing to do with an epidemic or any</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.159" end="00:34:14.389" style="s2">just they are shoveling this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.280" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">as much as they are able to yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.389" end="00:34:21.349" style="s2">that is that&#39;s definitely happening here</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:23.780" style="s2">yes so it&#39;s crazy and yeah that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.349" end="00:34:26.750" style="s2">another angle to look at it then you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.780" end="00:34:31.849" style="s2">have the application and this opens oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.750" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">oh we&#39;ve lost your audio you can&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.849" end="00:34:36.490" style="s2">you anymore the deep state is cut you</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.559" end="00:34:40.849" style="s2">they always seem to do that at just the</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.419" end="00:34:44.329" style="s2">right offer two times nope getting too</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.849" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">close to the truth okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.329" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">yeah we still can&#39;t hear you yeah it cut</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:52.750" style="s2">off like mid word try going out and back</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:58.299" style="s2">in sometimes that works</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.750" end="00:34:58.299" style="s2">strangely enough and hey ray</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.499" end="00:35:06.440" style="s2">hi guys hey glad to be stopping in what</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.670" end="00:35:09.349" style="s2">a what a great conversation you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.440" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">having I&#39;ll be in a board meeting but</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.349" end="00:35:12.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s still the board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:13.910" style="s2">that&#39;s really awesome I&#39;m enjoying it</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.140" end="00:35:15.859" style="s2">and that is I think we stopped trying to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.910" end="00:35:17.390" style="s2">have a board we didn&#39;t just have a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.859" end="00:35:18.999" style="s2">funny so it&#39;s one of the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.390" end="00:35:21.589" style="s2">I&#39;m looking to set up in two weeks is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.999" end="00:35:23.329" style="s2">and I just got the wording for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.589" end="00:35:24.950" style="s2">technological Commons like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.329" end="00:35:26.480" style="s2">powerful about what we can create</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.950" end="00:35:28.220" style="s2">together it&#39;s basically that&#39;s without</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.480" end="00:35:29.990" style="s2">actually creating anything happening the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.220" end="00:35:32.059" style="s2">conversation what that generates but</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.990" end="00:35:36.430" style="s2">this is kind of it like I&#39;m like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.059" end="00:35:39.019" style="s2">know it&#39;s everyone or is this is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.430" end="00:35:41.059" style="s2">yeah I mean part of it too is we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.019" end="00:35:42.440" style="s2">really like bore defied the board</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.059" end="00:35:49.369" style="s2">reading yet it sort of starts off as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.440" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">board meeting and then meanders to which</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.369" end="00:35:52.279" style="s2">yeah I think as we get more you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:53.660" style="s2">sort of like actually have things to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.279" end="00:35:55.730" style="s2">discuss the agenda will get longer and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;ll become a more you know half an</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.730" end="00:36:01.999" style="s2">hour board meeting topics and then half</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:04.069" style="s2">an hour of whatever I think also once we</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.999" end="00:36:05.239" style="s2">get it figured out um possibly doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.069" end="00:36:08.239" style="s2">something like going through the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.239" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">protocol of stuff right like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.239" end="00:36:11.410" style="s2">incorporate like less about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:14.269" style="s2">incorporation like the legal</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.410" end="00:36:15.589" style="s2">incorporation which also to get fun used</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.269" end="00:36:17.480" style="s2">to do that we definitely need to do at</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.589" end="00:36:18.980" style="s2">the gaming world but even more</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.480" end="00:36:20.930" style="s2">importantly to know what entity did know</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.980" end="00:36:23.450" style="s2">what going through like what our values</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.930" end="00:36:24.619" style="s2">what our was when he&#39;s gone right now</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.450" end="00:36:27.499" style="s2">I&#39;m hoping the tutor was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.619" end="00:36:30.019" style="s2">values I know I have values for together</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.499" end="00:36:31.489" style="s2">attack that especially the beginning I</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.019" end="00:36:33.319" style="s2">was like I can&#39;t get or anyone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.489" end="00:36:35.269" style="s2">project and once it&#39;s like these things</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.319" end="00:36:36.739" style="s2">and it has to be these things and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.269" end="00:36:39.529" style="s2">still hold those four together tech in</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.739" end="00:36:43.249" style="s2">any project I&#39;m on has to hold those but</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.529" end="00:36:45.349" style="s2">I think it&#39;s like just like a B&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.249" end="00:36:46.609" style="s2">of event diagram all the Venn diagrams</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.349" end="00:36:47.749" style="s2">of what&#39;s important to me and what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.609" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">bring to the table</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.749" end="00:36:52.609" style="s2">so is my value system right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.380" style="s2">well which values are important it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.609" end="00:36:57.710" style="s2">actually all the values and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.380" end="00:36:59.150" style="s2">fact that my highest might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.710" end="00:37:00.950" style="s2">safety and someone else&#39;s might be</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.150" end="00:37:03.940" style="s2">justice someone else&#39;s might be equity I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.950" end="00:37:06.920" style="s2">don&#39;t even know it&#39;s art but like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.940" end="00:37:08.869" style="s2">together text honoring is in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.920" end="00:37:11.269" style="s2">diversity that those they&#39;re all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.869" end="00:37:13.100" style="s2">importance and yes we called means one</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.269" end="00:37:15.310" style="s2">two three at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.100" end="00:37:17.540" style="s2">because we commonly hold them together</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.310" end="00:37:18.920" style="s2">Aaron you know like kinda like the club</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.540" end="00:37:20.660" style="s2">but one cloud right where it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.920" end="00:37:22.040" style="s2">look we all have integrity cuz already</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.660" end="00:37:24.380" style="s2">doing ones that they don&#39;t make the list</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.040" end="00:37:26.210" style="s2">because they&#39;re so common amongst us we</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.380" end="00:37:31.670" style="s2">don&#39;t even know that other people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.210" end="00:37:33.950" style="s2">share them right and so anyway makes</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.670" end="00:37:36.410" style="s2">sense for together tech to reverse it</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.950" end="00:37:39.100" style="s2">and instead of saying what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.410" end="00:37:41.570" style="s2">have just say what you can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.100" end="00:37:44.060" style="s2">because I exert going to be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.570" end="00:37:46.550" style="s2">right like what are the things that like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.060" end="00:37:47.510" style="s2">you know most people involved agree like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.550" end="00:37:50.000" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t want that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.510" end="00:37:51.590" style="s2">project and like is it that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.000" end="00:37:54.290" style="s2">have you know three or more of them is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.590" end="00:37:55.880" style="s2">if any single one of them is that yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.290" end="00:37:57.650" style="s2">think we&#39;ve had this talk a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.880" end="00:38:00.410" style="s2">times where it&#39;s like individual</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.650" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">projects will have their own values and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.410" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">things that they&#39;re trying to solve but</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:04.910" style="s2">then together tech what well how have</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:07.160" style="s2">its own it&#39;s kind of a network of</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.910" end="00:38:08.990" style="s2">projects to say kind of if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.160" end="00:38:11.420" style="s2">joining together tech why look what do</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.990" end="00:38:13.190" style="s2">all these people or these projects that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.420" end="00:38:14.360" style="s2">I&#39;m joined together tech why did they</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.190" end="00:38:18.530" style="s2">did you go any what do they have in</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.360" end="00:38:20.360" style="s2">common and also I mean like I&#39;m good a</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.530" end="00:38:22.610" style="s2">whole different I&#39;m gonna hold different</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.360" end="00:38:24.200" style="s2">values my projects I&#39;m on are gonna hold</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.610" end="00:38:26.060" style="s2">different values and together tech like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.200" end="00:38:29.030" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about in terms of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.060" end="00:38:30.440" style="s2">technological Commons right so what is</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.030" end="00:38:32.330" style="s2">it that&#39;s in that common space what</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.440" end="00:38:37.310" style="s2">values are in that common space what</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.330" end="00:38:39.620" style="s2">then I&#39;m not answering that question as</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.310" end="00:38:42.020" style="s2">Jubilee what is usually hope valuable it</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.620" end="00:38:44.060" style="s2">is truly what benefits the Commons the</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.020" end="00:38:46.090" style="s2">most right and it&#39;s trust transparent</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.060" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">like it&#39;s like that&#39;s bigger than</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.090" end="00:38:50.600" style="s2">honestly my ethics right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.790" style="s2">bigger than does it you slave labor even</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.600" end="00:38:54.890" style="s2">because it&#39;s like right what I want is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.790" end="00:38:56.420" style="s2">actual truth and whether it uses slave</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.890" end="00:38:58.490" style="s2">labor at a higher priority if not you</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.420" end="00:39:00.740" style="s2">slave labor so that I can make mirthless</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.490" end="00:39:02.870" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a slightly different or</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.740" end="00:39:06.260" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like a slightly more logical</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.870" end="00:39:07.970" style="s2">algorithmic value system so then I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.260" end="00:39:12.080" style="s2">live my values if that makes sense I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.970" end="00:39:14.210" style="s2">think I just okayed slave labor that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.080" end="00:39:16.250" style="s2">good if slightly uncomfortable example</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.210" end="00:39:19.220" style="s2">is if something used in slave labor but</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.250" end="00:39:21.490" style="s2">it uses 5% of what the competing company</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.220" end="00:39:24.670" style="s2">uses I mean it&#39;s a massive improvement</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.490" end="00:39:26.370" style="s2">but is it you know Nix because of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.670" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">small like</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.370" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">the much smaller amount is that still</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:34.530" style="s2">negating or are we after improvement</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">over perfection I mean there&#39;s no right</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.530" end="00:39:39.540" style="s2">answer right like as you said you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:43.500" style="s2">really want to come on the side of like</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.540" end="00:39:46.230" style="s2">yeah for sure slavery like no nobody but</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.500" end="00:39:48.360" style="s2">you know it&#39;s when do you make that call</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.230" end="00:39:50.970" style="s2">when do you say I don&#39;t like it but it</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.360" end="00:39:54.450" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s an improvement</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.970" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not really especially with</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.450" end="00:39:57.960" style="s2">slavery to be like how dare you use</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.520" end="00:39:59.730" style="s2">slavery I&#39;m like I&#39;m so what are we</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.960" end="00:40:03.600" style="s2">talking on right now we&#39;re all using</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.730" end="00:40:04.890" style="s2">slavery and so like just say okay long</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:06.600" style="s2">you&#39;ve been only buy computers that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.890" end="00:40:09.120" style="s2">zero slavery I&#39;m not gonna be on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.600" end="00:40:11.190" style="s2">computer here&#39;s your Atticus but to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.120" end="00:40:13.590" style="s2">able to work back that that system to</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.190" end="00:40:15.420" style="s2">get less and less slavery and less I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.590" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">like because of transparency which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.420" end="00:40:19.380" style="s2">right we could only get cobalt fruits</p>

<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:58.300" style="s2">and if yeah if you ever guys wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.980" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">try to formally informally formally you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.300" end="00:42:01.600" style="s2">know form a form the group a little more</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:04.060" style="s2">cohesively yeah it would be great to</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.600" end="00:42:05.410" style="s2">share that just you can learn about it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.060" end="00:42:08.200" style="s2">in the process might be the most fun</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.410" end="00:42:11.470" style="s2">part because it does sound like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.200" end="00:42:13.590" style="s2">basically have your your in formal</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.470" end="00:42:15.550" style="s2">governance working just fine in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.590" end="00:42:17.380" style="s2">you probably know how you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.550" end="00:42:27.010" style="s2">decisions and you&#39;re writing them down</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.380" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">somewhere we&#39;re on video lines if</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.010" end="00:42:31.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a record of it it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:34.050" style="s2">none of us agree to taking notes so we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.930" end="00:42:36.820" style="s2">have an agenda</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.050" end="00:42:38.260" style="s2">so the transparent index isn&#39;t happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.820" end="00:42:39.850" style="s2">yet so yeah that&#39;s totally like then it</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.260" end="00:42:45.070" style="s2">could be the next step if and when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.850" end="00:42:48.610" style="s2">guys are ready may I have a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.070" end="00:42:51.340" style="s2">I spent a message on your form</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.610" end="00:42:54.220" style="s2">from Pat protocol that love or maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.340" end="00:42:55.660" style="s2">was your polka I&#39;m just wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.220" end="00:43:03.810" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s a time that we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.660" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">I have a project idea that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.810" end="00:43:09.120" style="s2">collaborative or maybe I could talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:11.770" style="s2">about finding a way to hire you to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.120" end="00:43:14.650" style="s2">design something for me I do have some</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.770" end="00:43:17.710" style="s2">being designed already but I and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.650" end="00:43:20.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s based on the Medicare in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.710" end="00:43:23.320" style="s2">C project so I think that chain would be</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.500" end="00:43:26.620" style="s2">perfect for it but she kind of artist</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.320" end="00:43:29.160" style="s2">and I feel like maybe this group isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.620" end="00:43:35.080" style="s2">right for me there was a lot of talk</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.160" end="00:43:40.200" style="s2">last week about I don&#39;t know I just felt</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.080" end="00:43:42.610" style="s2">really undervalued and I&#39;m not sure I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.200" end="00:43:46.570" style="s2">don&#39;t feel like I fit with this because</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.610" end="00:43:51.410" style="s2">I&#39;m not maybe 10 or Arts Hulu or</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.570" end="00:43:54.390" style="s2">whatever but talking about it is amazing</p>

<p begin="00:44:04.320" end="00:44:08.570" style="s2">but if you&#39;re on Facebook that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.490" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">very tech savvy there&#39;s a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:39.840" style="s2">the things feel like they&#39;re like too</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:41.640" style="s2">technical and my brain like goes off and</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.840" end="00:44:45.390" style="s2">sometimes I make it like I don&#39;t belong</p>

<p begin="00:44:58.830" end="00:45:03.300" style="s2">it&#39;s a very important project and even</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.500" end="00:45:05.340" style="s2">if it&#39;s not quite articulated that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.300" end="00:45:07.830" style="s2">it&#39;s um I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m trying to</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.830" end="00:45:15.300" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling that you don&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.390" end="00:45:17.340" style="s2">here it&#39;s not from us or if there is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.300" end="00:45:20.700" style="s2">something we&#39;ve done or said and please</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.340" end="00:45:24.270" style="s2">absolutely let me know because yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.700" end="00:45:26.940" style="s2">know you I&#39;m in the midst of reading a</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.270" end="00:45:27.990" style="s2">book on sort of like you know building</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.940" end="00:45:31.710" style="s2">your board and how you should structure</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.990" end="00:45:33.930" style="s2">it and one of the key things is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.710" end="00:45:35.460" style="s2">diversity on the board and like of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.930" end="00:45:36.750" style="s2">everything so a huge part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.460" end="00:45:39.060" style="s2">having people who aren&#39;t super technical</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.750" end="00:45:40.500" style="s2">so if we get too technical and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.060" end="00:45:41.490" style="s2">like I don&#39;t understand well guess what</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.500" end="00:45:43.080" style="s2">a lot of people watching are gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.490" end="00:45:44.580" style="s2">understand either so we should maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.080" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">get that deep in that section and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.580" end="00:45:50.790" style="s2">have a different one for a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:53.580" style="s2">committee or something so it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.790" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">important part of having a really varied</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.580" end="00:45:57.300" style="s2">board as far as like skill sets and all</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:45:58.980" style="s2">right because even if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.300" end="00:45:59.910" style="s2">technical you already seem to have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.980" end="00:46:02.910" style="s2">better understanding you like</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.910" end="00:46:04.120" style="s2">cryptocurrency did I do for sure so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.910" end="00:46:07.000" style="s2">alone I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.120" end="00:46:08.110" style="s2">that&#39;s still technical so you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.000" end="00:46:10.450" style="s2">know you know more than me and at least</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.110" end="00:46:12.550" style="s2">one area and I think you&#39;ve been on</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:14.200" style="s2">another front like with doing game B and</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.550" end="00:46:17.440" style="s2">coming together as a team and doing any</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.200" end="00:46:19.270" style="s2">of this stuff is like those</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.440" end="00:46:20.830" style="s2">uncomfortable feelings that come up both</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.270" end="00:46:22.150" style="s2">feet like internal ones like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.830" end="00:46:24.220" style="s2">belong I&#39;m not good enough are not but</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.150" end="00:46:25.420" style="s2">also like the actual interconnection of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.220" end="00:46:27.670" style="s2">like someone says something wrong we</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.420" end="00:46:29.110" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about it or whether it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.670" end="00:46:30.280" style="s2">wrong or not it was taken the wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.110" end="00:46:34.270" style="s2">was taken differently that it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.280" end="00:46:36.130" style="s2">intended and like that that&#39;s like our</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.270" end="00:46:37.360" style="s2">egos there&#39;s everything right and when</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.130" end="00:46:40.120" style="s2">there gets to be uncomfortable emotions</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.360" end="00:46:42.160" style="s2">game a the current world is about like</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.120" end="00:46:43.840" style="s2">push them down don&#39;t feel down there now</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.160" end="00:46:45.940" style="s2">how dare you bring this up Shiloh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.840" end="00:46:49.180" style="s2">Gore meeting right like and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.940" end="00:46:51.390" style="s2">because that&#39;s some of the most valuable</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.180" end="00:46:54.670" style="s2">stuff we&#39;re gonna get is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.390" end="00:46:58.450" style="s2">that right as an individual I&#39;m feeling</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.670" end="00:46:59.980" style="s2">like one that when you don&#39;t feel right</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.450" end="00:47:01.870" style="s2">right when you&#39;re feeling like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.980" end="00:47:03.460" style="s2">not in the best mood do you show up to</p>

<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:21.250" style="s2">rule where it&#39;s like no this is about</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.600" end="00:47:22.060" style="s2">this thing and so you can&#39;t show up</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.250" end="00:47:24.040" style="s2">unless you&#39;re in your highest</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.060" end="00:47:26.680" style="s2">consciousness that&#39;s a pretty high bar</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.040" end="00:47:28.540" style="s2">to set and so we&#39;re all gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.680" end="00:47:30.880" style="s2">different times of being high and being</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.540" end="00:47:32.470" style="s2">low and being and like honoring that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.880" end="00:47:33.790" style="s2">both in like I&#39;m not going to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.470" end="00:47:37.060" style="s2">the best today and I wondering that like</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.790" end="00:47:39.310" style="s2">I&#39;m feeling feeling and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.060" end="00:47:40.840" style="s2">where or why right I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.310" end="00:47:42.730" style="s2">it&#39;s me I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.840" end="00:47:45.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know like I don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.730" end="00:47:50.980" style="s2">it&#39;s like what is there here but anytime</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:52.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a uncomfortable emotion I find</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.980" end="00:47:54.610" style="s2">that that&#39;s like there&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.930" end="00:47:58.900" style="s2">something there like something to learn</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.610" end="00:48:01.180" style="s2">something to and the more willing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.900" end="00:48:03.100" style="s2">share the better sorry actually why I</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.180" end="00:48:05.740" style="s2">came today I&#39;m really busy actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.100" end="00:48:07.480" style="s2">doing a lot of yard work and I just had</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.740" end="00:48:13.660" style="s2">to set this time aside because I was</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.480" end="00:48:18.450" style="s2">feeling very hurt and blocked because of</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.660" end="00:48:18.450" style="s2">it and so I just wanted to come on</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:26.310" style="s2">they were the air or what not so okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.660" end="00:48:28.380" style="s2">I&#39;m glad you said something and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.310" end="00:48:30.270" style="s2">also I mean we pretty much always stick</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.380" end="00:48:31.710" style="s2">around after two so if there&#39;s ever a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.270" end="00:48:33.810" style="s2">concern that you don&#39;t want to air you</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.710" end="00:48:35.580" style="s2">know live and recorded on YouTube that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.810" end="00:48:36.750" style="s2">also an option do you want to stick</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.580" end="00:48:38.190" style="s2">around after and say hey by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.750" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t you know he lied saying this in</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.190" end="00:48:43.050" style="s2">front of kind of the entire world but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:46.380" style="s2">you know et cetera and then we can catch</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.050" end="00:48:50.670" style="s2">the pup that way and can I just say that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.380" end="00:48:52.950" style="s2">bringing the non-technical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.670" end="00:48:58.050" style="s2">to the table is about the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.950" end="00:49:01.260" style="s2">that is possible here because so many</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.050" end="00:49:04.950" style="s2">systems are designed by the tech people</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.260" end="00:49:08.580" style="s2">who are programmers colors and and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.950" end="00:49:10.500" style="s2">are so awful to use and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.580" end="00:49:13.620" style="s2">whenever I think I see such a system</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.500" end="00:49:16.830" style="s2">it&#39;s okay surely a developer designed</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.620" end="00:49:19.020" style="s2">this because I can see how the thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.830" end="00:49:22.620" style="s2">processes went behind the project and</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.020" end="00:49:26.760" style="s2">why it was created this way but I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.620" end="00:49:29.520" style="s2">also so I can use it its first usually</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.760" end="00:49:31.890" style="s2">they are very ugly and secondly they</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.520" end="00:49:34.620" style="s2">look like they were designed by someone</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.890" end="00:49:37.590" style="s2">with like zero social skills and</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.620" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">consciousness about other people so</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.590" end="00:49:44.370" style="s2">non-technical stuff is great just we</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.280" end="00:49:46.020" style="s2">need more of this there&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.370" end="00:49:47.760" style="s2">book on that topic called the inmates</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.020" end="00:49:50.970" style="s2">are running the asylum that talks about</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.760" end="00:49:52.710" style="s2">sort of the start of software and like</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.970" end="00:49:54.690" style="s2">how it was developers that were making</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.710" end="00:49:56.340" style="s2">choices on usability and they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.690" end="00:49:58.080" style="s2">super techie people so they made techie</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.340" end="00:49:59.910" style="s2">usability choices other techies could</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.080" end="00:50:01.560" style="s2">pick it up and use it it&#39;s somebody that</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.910" end="00:50:03.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it&#39;s like I&#39;ve known what&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.120" end="00:50:45.870" style="s2">working in this in be world and also</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:48.750" style="s2">game a and you&#39;re trying to compete in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.870" end="00:50:51.540" style="s2">way either with each other or with game</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.750" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">a or however that is but with art you</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.540" end="00:50:56.520" style="s2">can actually practice something before</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">it&#39;s a reality so you can test things</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.520" end="00:51:04.100" style="s2">out in the real world on a diverse</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:08.940" style="s2">public and actually get results like</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.100" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">real-world results without having to set</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.940" end="00:51:13.530" style="s2">everything up and have all these rules</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:15.300" style="s2">and laws and exacting everything is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.530" end="00:51:22.020" style="s2">telling everybody how it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.300" end="00:51:24.990" style="s2">you can actually let them guide you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.020" end="00:51:26.700" style="s2">I love that it&#39;s very similar to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.990" end="00:51:30.720" style="s2">coming up for me this week like the art</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.490" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">competition and there&#39;s only one winner</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.870" end="00:51:36.900" style="s2">in the dance it&#39;s like show up and dance</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.780" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t really matter where you</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.900" end="00:51:41.130" style="s2">are and like art is the dance and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.780" end="00:51:43.080" style="s2">funny because I always label myself as</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.130" end="00:51:47.280" style="s2">like not an artist and I look at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.080" end="00:51:48.750" style="s2">like way that I create creation in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.280" end="00:51:50.940" style="s2">world and invention and it&#39;s in an</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.750" end="00:51:53.010" style="s2">artistic format like it&#39;s it&#39;s creative</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.940" end="00:51:54.660" style="s2">and artistic and it is it&#39;s like playing</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.010" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2">with it and making mistakes and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.660" end="00:51:58.470" style="s2">allowed to make mistakes in art and not</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:52:00.210" style="s2">getting too serious and although we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.470" end="00:52:04.020" style="s2">doing serious work right we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.210" end="00:52:06.060" style="s2">create a world that works it&#39;s also very</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.020" end="00:52:10.140" style="s2">important to know right that it takes</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.060" end="00:52:12.570" style="s2">all and so if it&#39;s not fun for you if</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.140" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not like why isn&#39;t it and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.570" end="00:52:16.620" style="s2">on us to make it fun raise even like</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:18.930" style="s2">working through those dynamics and that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.620" end="00:52:21.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean working through</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.930" end="00:52:26.130" style="s2">them here on camera whatever feels</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.420" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">comfortable not comfortable but my mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.130" end="00:52:31.590" style="s2">went blank but but honoring them right</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:33.570" style="s2">like not putting away and saying yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.590" end="00:52:36.160" style="s2">they&#39;re welcome it&#39;s welcome for those</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.570" end="00:52:39.190" style="s2">things to to show up and we&#39;ll deal with</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.160" end="00:52:40.330" style="s2">as we do even if you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.190" end="00:52:52.230" style="s2">dealing with it is on read it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.330" end="00:52:56.140" style="s2">off-camera you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.230" end="00:52:57.670" style="s2">money I ate all night both done landmark</p>

<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:08.890" style="s2">live work it wasn&#39;t quite a bad Oh</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.500" end="00:53:10.690" style="s2">learning from it how most of what we</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.890" end="00:53:12.010" style="s2">react to in the world is our story about</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.690" end="00:53:14.500" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in versus what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.010" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">actually happening and even knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.500" end="00:53:18.430" style="s2">you don&#39;t know that like they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:20.250" style="s2">like it still a continually keep</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.430" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">probably not because all we reacting</p>

<p begin="00:53:31.000" end="00:53:35.470" style="s2">about that right the emotion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.920" end="00:53:37.000" style="s2">brought up and why that emotions there</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.470" end="00:53:39.190" style="s2">that it I don&#39;t know for me anyway a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.000" end="00:53:41.530" style="s2">of times it&#39;s like a misunderstanding on</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.190" end="00:53:43.030" style="s2">the the reason and then I was someone</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.530" end="00:53:45.100" style="s2">who gives out this understanding a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.030" end="00:53:47.620" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s like oh that&#39;s not how I</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.100" end="00:53:49.210" style="s2">meant that at all and I get why people</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.620" end="00:53:52.150" style="s2">get it that way but it&#39;s in a different</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.210" end="00:53:54.790" style="s2">way just uh I wish as a society we had</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.150" end="00:53:59.080" style="s2">other ways to deal with it oh where it</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.790" end="00:54:01.120" style="s2">wasn&#39;t so considered rude to ask or rude</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.080" end="00:54:02.740" style="s2">to clarify right to because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.120" end="00:54:04.630" style="s2">you do just react is instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.740" end="00:54:06.190" style="s2">wait did you mean it like this like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.630" end="00:54:10.300" style="s2">feeling hurt because I take it like this</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.190" end="00:54:15.400" style="s2">and then like oh no that&#39;s not I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.300" end="00:54:19.330" style="s2">either easier that&#39;s what I practiced a</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.400" end="00:54:26.260" style="s2">little bit in I mean using my son&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.330" end="00:54:31.570" style="s2">kindergarten we have this but of parents</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.260" end="00:54:33.490" style="s2">and teachers are really NPC enabled so</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.570" end="00:54:38.890" style="s2">to speak and we see being the nonviolent</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.490" end="00:54:40.810" style="s2">communication and this is amazing and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.890" end="00:54:45.010" style="s2">is so critically hard sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.810" end="00:54:48.250" style="s2">especially to get in the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.010" end="00:54:52.569" style="s2">actually listening to the other person</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.250" end="00:54:55.900" style="s2">and until you start practicing that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.569" end="00:54:59.020" style="s2">really don&#39;t know how hard it is and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.900" end="00:55:04.109" style="s2">also discovery for me I was like and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.020" end="00:55:09.460" style="s2">then there was this way off in which</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.109" end="00:55:13.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like I you said something and I go</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.460" end="00:55:15.069" style="s2">okay what I heard what I understood is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.060" end="00:55:19.060" style="s2">this and this is correct me if I&#39;m wrong</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.069" end="00:55:21.839" style="s2">and practicing this after a while it</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.060" end="00:55:26.050" style="s2">really allows to understand and be more</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.839" end="00:55:28.630" style="s2">like seeing the situation from some</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.050" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">perspective not from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.630" end="00:55:34.540" style="s2">my own head but from outside and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:37.150" style="s2">amazing how much is missed when we have</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.540" end="00:55:41.530" style="s2">this only narrow point of view here</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.150" end="00:55:43.720" style="s2">right so right it reminds me of a saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.530" end="00:55:44.490" style="s2">seek first to understand and then to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.720" end="00:55:47.490" style="s2">understood</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.490" end="00:55:47.490" style="s2">mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.160" end="00:55:58.740" style="s2">Rathi near the end of the hour for the</p>

<p begin="00:55:58.740" end="00:56:04.710" style="s2">to start racking up the thoughts we have</p>

<p begin="00:56:14.819" end="00:56:20.430" style="s2">forward to get out of that session that</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.529" end="00:56:22.049" style="s2">day and come up with common solutions to</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.430" end="00:56:23.789" style="s2">whatever problems are rising in that</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.049" end="00:56:26.309" style="s2">space would you that every Saturday</p>

<p begin="00:56:28.019" end="00:56:32.130" style="s2">projects and a board meeting for how do</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.599" end="00:56:34.859" style="s2">we move them at a project forward how</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.130" end="00:56:36.569" style="s2">can we create something the</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.859" end="00:56:38.430" style="s2">technological Commons or in our first</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.569" end="00:56:40.140" style="s2">project from the technological comments</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.430" end="00:56:48.569" style="s2">whatever that happens to be more more in</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.140" end="00:56:49.619" style="s2">the conversation part of that pebble so</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.569" end="00:56:50.940" style="s2">that there at the end you guys are</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.619" end="00:56:52.559" style="s2">talking about a lot of human</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.940" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">technologies human interaction all</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:57.750" style="s2">technologies a critical visa the</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:56:59.819" style="s2">protocol that love work for sure so like</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.750" end="00:57:02.549" style="s2">the extent there&#39;s ever interest to just</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.819" end="00:57:04.230" style="s2">take making notes and best practices in</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.549" end="00:57:08.839" style="s2">terms of you know what the stuff comes</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.230" end="00:57:08.839" style="s2">up how to process through they had</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.019" end="00:57:16.579" style="s2">that&#39;s important work I&#39;m in I&#39;m in to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.849" end="00:57:21.720" style="s2">do that I didn&#39;t do some reading on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.579" end="00:57:24.029" style="s2">protocol and actually the whole chain</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.720" end="00:57:27.809" style="s2">and that seems to be like totally</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.029" end="00:57:31.980" style="s2">interesting that I was not totally aware</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.809" end="00:57:34.109" style="s2">of what it does before and that there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.980" end="00:57:37.230" style="s2">some answer to privacy and data of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.109" end="00:57:42.599" style="s2">users kept in one place and being used</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.230" end="00:57:46.109" style="s2">by various different interfaces so there</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.599" end="00:57:50.789" style="s2">is great possibility there and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.109" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">protocol is that&#39;s amazingly convergent</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.789" end="00:57:58.130" style="s2">on some things I did read before like</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.400" end="00:58:03.420" style="s2">please correct me if I&#39;m wrong but it</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.660" end="00:58:04.740" style="s2">seems that all the different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.420" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">the protocol</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.740" end="00:58:11.580" style="s2">our notes before passing like value</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.839" end="00:58:16.099" style="s2">values not the best workers but</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.580" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">themselves but it&#39;s more like setting</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.099" end="00:58:23.150" style="s2">banks of the river and making streams</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:32.760" style="s2">through which the value can flow and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.150" end="00:58:35.880" style="s2">feedback mixes yeah yeah go one step</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.760" end="00:58:37.320" style="s2">further is this certain extents the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.880" end="00:58:38.670" style="s2">banks of the river but it becomes the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.320" end="00:58:41.099" style="s2">banks of the river because it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.670" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">the sand that the water starts flowing</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.099" end="00:58:46.109" style="s2">through and as the water find natural</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:48.119" style="s2">path then the riverbanks start forming</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.109" end="00:58:58.230" style="s2">to create structure around what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.119" end="00:59:00.450" style="s2">emergent right now there&#39;s about 15</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.230" end="00:59:01.830" style="s2">different collectives that are in</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.450" end="00:59:04.560" style="s2">various processes with reflective</p>
