<p begin="00:00:32.610" end="00:00:41.480" style="s2">show it yeah so it&#39;s this platform where</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.500" end="00:00:44.550" style="s2">I want to encourage people to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.480" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">sustainable only wind solutions for all</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.550" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">kind of problems that you can come up</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:54.329" style="s2">with and then to promote the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">implementation of those and yes I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.329" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">been thinking about this project for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">while now and the aspirations for today</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:11.780" style="s2">would would be pretty much to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">feedback for those ideas that I have and</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.780" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">get a little bit maybe some help in</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">getting people involved and continuing</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:26.040" style="s2">to develop this project and yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">also really curious whether people think</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.040" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">it will work or not I have heard in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">past some feedback that says won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:40.729" style="s2">anyway and yeah just rescues what you</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:40.729" style="s2">guys think</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:50.570" style="s2">um yeah this project is basically like</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.619" end="00:01:52.850" style="s2">um three pillars one is where people</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.570" end="00:01:56.840" style="s2">come in and discuss their solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.850" end="00:02:02.330" style="s2">find find the problems the other pillar</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.840" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">is kind of voting but I voting has</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.330" end="00:02:07.670" style="s2">always a little bit this negative all</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:12.260" style="s2">the voting is only the worst situation</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.670" end="00:02:15.019" style="s2">possible ways of finding solution</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.260" end="00:02:18.350" style="s2">together it&#39;s not really voting it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.019" end="00:02:20.900" style="s2">more yes</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.350" end="00:02:23.840" style="s2">something similar anyway I come to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.900" end="00:02:27.620" style="s2">a little bit later and in detail but</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.840" end="00:02:30.500" style="s2">this process of figuring out which of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.620" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">the possible solutions we should</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.500" end="00:02:38.570" style="s2">implement and then the third pillar is</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:42.650" style="s2">the implementation and the incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.570" end="00:02:48.320" style="s2">implement on this so I had the idea to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.650" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">create a some crypto token or something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.320" end="00:02:59.329" style="s2">that will then give an out to people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:03:02.150" style="s2">implement possible solutions the whole</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.329" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">platform is supposed to be all</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.150" end="00:03:10.670" style="s2">open-source and evolve dynamically um ie</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:13.970" style="s2">everybody sort of first of all</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.670" end="00:03:17.269" style="s2">developers can contribute since it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.970" end="00:03:20.000" style="s2">open-source it should be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.269" end="00:03:25.280" style="s2">forked or cloned and people can use</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.000" end="00:03:29.150" style="s2">their own thing and also with in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.280" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">platform people should be able to post</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.150" end="00:03:36.170" style="s2">ideas about how to improve the platform</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.269" end="00:03:40.130" style="s2">itself um yeah so so the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.170" end="00:03:42.739" style="s2">should be quite organic and so none of</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.130" end="00:03:45.709" style="s2">the ideas that I&#39;m going to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.739" end="00:03:49.549" style="s2">about now are set in stone because they</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.709" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">should all be able to be changed by</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.549" end="00:03:58.010" style="s2">whoever is participating</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:04:04.770" style="s2">so the first bits the solution finding</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.010" end="00:04:10.610" style="s2">problem I was thinking of having some</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.770" end="00:04:15.990" style="s2">kind of mix between reddit and Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.610" end="00:04:19.890" style="s2">so that people can post their their</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.990" end="00:04:22.770" style="s2">ideas then people can discuss about</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.890" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">those ones like in reddit people can up</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.770" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">and download things that they like or</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:31.790" style="s2">dislike opinions that they think is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">more or less valid um</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.790" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">and then at the top of all of it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:43.160" style="s2">there should be some kind of summary</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:46.890" style="s2">that can be edited like in Wikipedia a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.160" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">summary of all the major important</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.890" end="00:04:54.600" style="s2">points that have been said and also</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">linked to those posts so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.600" end="00:05:02.850" style="s2">writes a topic on a specific viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">or so um then to have one sentence or</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.850" end="00:05:07.380" style="s2">something in the summary with a link to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">it if you want to have more information</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.380" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">about it then you will jump directly to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">the post and the reason for doing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:20.520" style="s2">is because I I think it&#39;s first it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:23.490" style="s2">quite important to have the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.520" end="00:05:26.430" style="s2">to voice your opinion in in quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.490" end="00:05:30.540" style="s2">of detail but nobody has the time to</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.430" end="00:05:34.380" style="s2">read through all of this and so there</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.540" end="00:05:36.470" style="s2">needs to be some way of compressing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.380" end="00:05:40.950" style="s2">down to a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.470" end="00:05:46.530" style="s2">and so that Wikipedia style summary can</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.950" end="00:05:48.660" style="s2">be you know moderated um and it should</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.530" end="00:05:51.419" style="s2">have history and stuff so that you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.660" end="00:05:54.120" style="s2">if someone does something stupid you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.419" end="00:05:59.830" style="s2">undo it and yeah all these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.120" end="00:06:03.350" style="s2">things there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.830" end="00:06:09.200" style="s2">tweaks to these to the system like for</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.350" end="00:06:11.870" style="s2">example posts could be anonymized um I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.200" end="00:06:16.100" style="s2">think that might be something more less</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.870" end="00:06:20.680" style="s2">important because you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.100" end="00:06:24.320" style="s2">effect of if someone is well-known then</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:25.760" style="s2">other people will just like the post no</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.320" end="00:06:29.879" style="s2">matter whether it&#39;s actually good or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.760" end="00:06:32.509" style="s2">um also I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.879" end="00:06:35.969" style="s2">true whether the upwards and downwards</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.509" end="00:06:38.369" style="s2">should actually be miserable um maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.969" end="00:06:40.229" style="s2">it&#39;s better not for them not to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.369" end="00:06:42.509" style="s2">miserable so that people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.229" end="00:06:45.089" style="s2">influenced and that they actually only</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.509" end="00:06:46.499" style="s2">vote on things that I have read through</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.089" end="00:06:51.139" style="s2">and that they really think they are good</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.499" end="00:06:53.909" style="s2">and not just by popular opinion also</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.139" end="00:06:57.959" style="s2">there could be a mechanism to randomly</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.909" end="00:07:01.020" style="s2">actually show like the first some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.959" end="00:07:04.559" style="s2">best posts or so but without actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.020" end="00:07:09.689" style="s2">showing the the votes and there are some</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.559" end="00:07:12.300" style="s2">things around it to make that system to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.689" end="00:07:16.229" style="s2">have avoid this kind of group bias that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.300" end="00:07:20.279" style="s2">we see so often and some other kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.229" end="00:07:24.809" style="s2">influencing so then based on those</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.279" end="00:07:29.219" style="s2">things um on those ideas that come up</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.809" end="00:07:33.809" style="s2">during this discussion people can host a</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.219" end="00:07:36.209" style="s2">possible solution um and those those so</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.809" end="00:07:40.169" style="s2">there can be multiple possible solutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.209" end="00:07:43.709" style="s2">in parallel so for example um you</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.169" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">believe was talking yesterday about food</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.709" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">um how do we solve food basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:52.199" style="s2">and then someone could come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:59.999" style="s2">solution you know that has this problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.199" end="00:08:02.459" style="s2">that I think the title of it zero slaves</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.999" end="00:08:05.999" style="s2">and three tons of carbon more so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.459" end="00:08:07.529" style="s2">basically how do we reduce reduce the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.999" end="00:08:10.289" style="s2">amount of slaves that we need and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.529" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">carbon footprint and then there could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.289" end="00:08:19.580" style="s2">a one solution might be to um actually I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:20.930" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.580" end="00:08:25.550" style="s2">thought about something there yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.930" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2">but I forgot anyway to to grow your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.550" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">plants locally um that could be one</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.000" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">solution another solution could be to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.430" end="00:08:42.099" style="s2">fail plan share food with your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:45.019" style="s2">say so these are two solutions and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.099" end="00:08:48.170" style="s2">people can vote on ok I like this idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.019" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">really much about growing your plants</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.170" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">locally and then that has um a number of</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:59.899" style="s2">votes then someone can come and say ok</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:05.810" style="s2">good I&#39;m planting now some whatever</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.899" end="00:09:09.079" style="s2">cabbage here on my field proof that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.810" end="00:09:11.480" style="s2">person has done it by I don&#39;t know some</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.079" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">kind of documentation or photos whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.480" end="00:09:17.540" style="s2">uploaded to the community this proof</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:21.649" style="s2">there it can be validated</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.540" end="00:09:23.450" style="s2">um so someone can from the neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.649" end="00:09:26.209" style="s2">can say yeah that&#39;s correct he has</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.450" end="00:09:27.529" style="s2">really done that or so or I have read</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.209" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">through the documentation and it all</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.529" end="00:09:34.640" style="s2">looks good blah blah and then one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:39.649" style="s2">once it&#39;s validated that person who has</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.640" end="00:09:42.579" style="s2">grown the food will receive a reward so</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.649" end="00:09:47.529" style="s2">those rewards tokens and they depend on</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.579" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">how many people have voted for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.529" end="00:09:56.500" style="s2">solution so how many and the ratio of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:10:01.910" style="s2">her how people have voted for it</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.500" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">so if 90% of the people so say 900</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.910" end="00:10:09.170" style="s2">people have voted for it 100 people I</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:12.740" style="s2">voted against it then there would be say</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.170" end="00:10:16.100" style="s2">800 tokens that are given to the person</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.740" end="00:10:18.740" style="s2">who plans to field um if they are our</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.100" end="00:10:22.519" style="s2">500 people voting forward 500 people</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.740" end="00:10:25.240" style="s2">against it then they wouldn&#39;t get any</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.519" end="00:10:29.290" style="s2">tokens because it&#39;s obviously an a</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.240" end="00:10:32.400" style="s2">solution that is very contra picked a of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.290" end="00:10:34.110" style="s2">um how to say yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.400" end="00:10:36.180" style="s2">it&#39;s not not quite clear whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.110" end="00:10:38.400" style="s2">actually a good solution or not and um</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.180" end="00:10:45.390" style="s2">yeah people shouldn&#39;t necessarily get a</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.400" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">reward for doing something this the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.390" end="00:10:51.980" style="s2">voting itself it</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">I mean that can can be heaps of</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.980" end="00:11:00.060" style="s2">different voting mechanisms and Sutphin</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:11:02.970" style="s2">that that can be either defined by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.060" end="00:11:07.590" style="s2">community or it can be liked by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.970" end="00:11:10.770" style="s2">topic um so some topics they might have</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.590" end="00:11:12.960" style="s2">different voting requirements than some</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.770" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">others you know some some things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.960" end="00:11:21.960" style="s2">one-off solution some things are an more</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:25.220" style="s2">ongoing thing for example some things</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.960" end="00:11:28.700" style="s2">have a deadline some others don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.220" end="00:11:32.310" style="s2">yes so that the community could always</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.700" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">just how they want people to vote for</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.310" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">these kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.930" end="00:11:43.290" style="s2">then there&#39;s also of course the issue</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.089" end="00:11:45.510" style="s2">that there might be too much too much</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.290" end="00:11:48.029" style="s2">going on so nobody can read through all</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.510" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">the topics all the problems vote for all</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.029" end="00:11:58.140" style="s2">the things so the whole system should I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:12:02.190" style="s2">think at least should be based on some</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.140" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">kind of liquid democracy or I sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.190" end="00:12:07.910" style="s2">call it steam democracy one step further</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:10.980" style="s2">it&#39;s a liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.910" end="00:12:12.930" style="s2">this way you can pass on your words to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.980" end="00:12:15.870" style="s2">someone else you can delegate your votes</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.930" end="00:12:20.250" style="s2">and that person can then vote on your</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.870" end="00:12:24.620" style="s2">behalf with additional voting power with</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.250" end="00:12:29.070" style="s2">your voting power you can specify</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.620" end="00:12:31.470" style="s2">individual areas of expertise like where</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.070" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">you want to delegate a vote so you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.470" end="00:12:36.779" style="s2">say okay in terms of environment I want</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:39.089" style="s2">Bentley to vote for me in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.779" end="00:12:45.089" style="s2">economy I want a drill toward for me</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.089" end="00:12:49.010" style="s2">whatever and I can always vote myself on</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.089" end="00:12:56.150" style="s2">a specific one the steam part comes in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.010" end="00:13:00.270" style="s2">because most of the things of the topics</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.150" end="00:13:05.610" style="s2">they should be only they should never be</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.270" end="00:13:08.310" style="s2">closed like right now most of those</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.610" end="00:13:11.520" style="s2">decision making things they have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.310" end="00:13:15.150" style="s2">deadline and they will be set in stone</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.520" end="00:13:18.330" style="s2">at some point put into law whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.150" end="00:13:22.450" style="s2">I envision it more as something that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.330" end="00:13:25.999" style="s2">always open and is always</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.450" end="00:13:28.579" style="s2">be able to change so</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.999" end="00:13:30.259" style="s2">if something changes in society if</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.579" end="00:13:33.499" style="s2">there&#39;s something happening if some new</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.259" end="00:13:36.889" style="s2">evidence comes out people can actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.499" end="00:13:40.999" style="s2">withdraw their votes again or can add</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.889" end="00:13:43.279" style="s2">additional words at any given point in</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.999" end="00:13:49.069" style="s2">order to really reflect what people</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.279" end="00:13:57.669" style="s2">think at any point then in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.069" end="00:14:00.729" style="s2">that system not too too unstable</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.669" end="00:14:07.569" style="s2">everything that has passed a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.729" end="00:14:14.239" style="s2">threshold um I I would envision this as</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.569" end="00:14:17.389" style="s2">as being kind of the the status quo for</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.239" end="00:14:19.399" style="s2">the moment and then if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.389" end="00:14:22.279" style="s2">balance changes so if something</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.399" end="00:14:24.559" style="s2">previously everybody voted for an issue</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.279" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">and then it changes and people vote</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.559" end="00:14:32.239" style="s2">against it then depending on how long it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:36.979" style="s2">has people have been voting for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.239" end="00:14:40.009" style="s2">issue when it&#39;s changing there should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.979" end="00:14:44.179" style="s2">a certain time so for example they have</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.009" end="00:14:47.119" style="s2">voted for issue a and it has been in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.179" end="00:14:53.119" style="s2">that way for two years then there should</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.119" end="00:14:59.029" style="s2">be a cool down face for um two years</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.119" end="00:15:03.429" style="s2">times 0.1 or so where that issue is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.029" end="00:15:07.579" style="s2">still for and only after that after the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.429" end="00:15:10.369" style="s2">three months or so it would change so</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.579" end="00:15:13.129" style="s2">that it&#39;s now okay I&#39;m officially it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.369" end="00:15:18.169" style="s2">stayed for three months in a negative</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.129" end="00:15:20.389" style="s2">and so that would reflect on the reward</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.169" end="00:15:22.009" style="s2">basically the reward in the first three</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.389" end="00:15:25.659" style="s2">months will still be positive and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.009" end="00:15:27.739" style="s2">um after three months will be negative</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.659" end="00:15:30.189" style="s2">not sure whether there was to clear but</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.739" end="00:15:30.189" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.960" end="00:15:39.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s I think the main main</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.760" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">points there um I think I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.400" end="00:15:45.460" style="s2">give it to Christians our disappoint</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:50.410" style="s2">them and then I can explain more if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.460" end="00:15:52.660" style="s2">require all right um I have one question</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.410" end="00:15:54.940" style="s2">that kind of goes into all of them which</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.660" end="00:15:57.910" style="s2">is what is your skill level for getting</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.940" end="00:15:59.200" style="s2">this thing made what you envision are</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.910" end="00:16:04.510" style="s2">you able to create it or do you need</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.200" end="00:16:11.100" style="s2">somebody else yes I can create it if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.510" end="00:16:17.710" style="s2">have like 20 years of time no sir I am a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.100" end="00:16:20.500" style="s2">broker Imam and Isis I I try it I</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.710" end="00:16:24.010" style="s2">started to make a prototype for this one</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.500" end="00:16:27.880" style="s2">but I&#39;m just didn&#39;t get very far because</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.010" end="00:16:31.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t have the time but if I say if I</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.880" end="00:16:34.300" style="s2">was to work on it full-time and probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.300" end="00:16:41.350" style="s2">I don&#39;t know a project like this two</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.300" end="00:16:45.520" style="s2">years maybe one yeah if I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.350" end="00:16:46.870" style="s2">full-time then yeah 20 years yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.520" end="00:16:48.190" style="s2">sounds like a lot of time to put into</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.870" end="00:16:50.620" style="s2">something that&#39;s a beta that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.190" end="00:16:54.240" style="s2">testing is there a way to bring it down</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.620" end="00:16:58.270" style="s2">to beta something you could create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.240" end="00:17:00.810" style="s2">problem you want solutions to and create</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.270" end="00:17:03.220" style="s2">either using existing technology or</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.810" end="00:17:03.940" style="s2">creating a beta something that you could</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.220" end="00:17:07.990" style="s2">then test</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.940" end="00:17:10.350" style="s2">is this working yes so that a few things</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.990" end="00:17:15.130" style="s2">like for example I also I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.350" end="00:17:19.060" style="s2">create all those bits by myself and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.130" end="00:17:22.030" style="s2">not set in stone with my own opinion</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.060" end="00:17:24.910" style="s2">about many of those things so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.030" end="00:17:29.260" style="s2">reasons why I joined the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.910" end="00:17:31.390" style="s2">Debates lab two years ago or so because</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.260" end="00:17:35.440" style="s2">I thought that might be something that</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.390" end="00:17:40.860" style="s2">is useful at some point for for my</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.440" end="00:17:48.000" style="s2">project you know a process where you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.860" end="00:17:50.520" style="s2">figure out you know facts and things</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:53.299" style="s2">about about an issue oh by the way I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.520" end="00:17:55.799" style="s2">sorry I&#39;m decreasing here a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.299" end="00:17:58.710" style="s2">but one other important thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.799" end="00:18:02.120" style="s2">all the issues they that are being</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.710" end="00:18:07.309" style="s2">discussed they should also have metrics</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.120" end="00:18:12.090" style="s2">alongside with it of what people experts</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.309" end="00:18:15.030" style="s2">who ever think how they might influence</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.090" end="00:18:18.740" style="s2">the society how they might influence</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.030" end="00:18:23.059" style="s2">environment how sustainable they are and</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.740" end="00:18:26.910" style="s2">those metrics they should flow into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.059" end="00:18:29.490" style="s2">the rewards so nothing that is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.910" end="00:18:33.200" style="s2">sustainable or everything that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.490" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">sustainable should have negative</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.200" end="00:18:39.660" style="s2">influence on rewards and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:43.110" style="s2">okay coming back to the point there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.660" end="00:18:45.090" style="s2">there are a few things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.110" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">narrowed down quite a bit and can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.090" end="00:18:50.730" style="s2">beta tested and all the basically that</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.070" end="00:18:53.730" style="s2">the individual pieces can be beta tested</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.730" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">by themselves like for example the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.730" end="00:18:58.470" style="s2">bit of finding these solutions</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:19:02.820" style="s2">um discussing and then putting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.470" end="00:19:07.740" style="s2">summary up on top that is can be its own</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.820" end="00:19:12.299" style="s2">a standalone feature um that that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.740" end="00:19:17.280" style="s2">could put out and then yeah bring it</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.299" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">online for for testing um that that was</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.280" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">actually also how I started him the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:25.770" style="s2">initial problem was um I was only</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:28.950" style="s2">interested in finding a way how to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.770" end="00:19:33.900" style="s2">discuss um these kind of things I called</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.950" end="00:19:35.940" style="s2">it what happens if because I was always</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.900" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">wondering like what happens if I do it</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.940" end="00:19:39.630" style="s2">isn&#39;t that I want to have feedback from</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:41.790" style="s2">people and then I want to write them I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.630" end="00:19:43.590" style="s2">want them to write posts and then ah</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.790" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">then I would want to have a summary</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.590" end="00:19:47.000" style="s2">because I can&#39;t read the whole of his</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:49.890" style="s2">blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.000" end="00:19:53.519" style="s2">yeah the other things actually some some</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.890" end="00:19:57.450" style="s2">of the things are not that&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.519" end="00:20:04.289" style="s2">beat it is for example the token the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.450" end="00:20:06.269" style="s2">reward token it it has to have the whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.289" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">system as an underlying thing and it</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.269" end="00:20:13.320" style="s2">also it already has to have quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:17.549" style="s2">of participation in order for it to gain</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.320" end="00:20:23.340" style="s2">any value so so this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.549" end="00:20:25.470" style="s2">is probably only in even if the whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.340" end="00:20:29.880" style="s2">underlying system is finished in two</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.470" end="00:20:32.100" style="s2">three years there until the rewards</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.880" end="00:20:34.590" style="s2">actually take take on some value and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.100" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">some life on their own it will take at</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.590" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">least five years I think but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.060" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">okay so one thing I want to make sure of</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.620" end="00:20:48.030" style="s2">it&#39;s just that I guess I fully</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">understand the plan so I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.030" end="00:20:51.480" style="s2">quickly go over like my skills and form</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:54.780" style="s2">notes and you see if I&#39;m missing</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.480" end="00:20:58.650" style="s2">anything so it says like step one is to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.780" end="00:21:01.140" style="s2">identify a problem after that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.650" end="00:21:02.250" style="s2">community would gather ideas it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.140" end="00:21:03.930" style="s2">like what the ideas people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.250" end="00:21:06.630" style="s2">submitting don&#39;t you let some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.930" end="00:21:08.340" style="s2">expert feedback to say like hey these</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.630" end="00:21:09.840" style="s2">three ideas sound great here&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.340" end="00:21:13.050" style="s2">experts have to say about those as far</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.840" end="00:21:17.070" style="s2">as these sustainability you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.050" end="00:21:20.460" style="s2">cost that type of thing yeah I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.070" end="00:21:26.790" style="s2">that as some of the users will be</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.460" end="00:21:29.190" style="s2">experts they will have a lot of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.790" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">from other issues that I contributed</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.190" end="00:21:35.570" style="s2">like similar to your recollections</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:37.560" style="s2">actually I think you also have something</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.570" end="00:21:42.380" style="s2">some people that are a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.560" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">expert and some less and that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.380" end="00:21:48.150" style="s2">not not necessarily visibly but under</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:50.520" style="s2">the hood it gets recorded on what kind</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.150" end="00:21:53.130" style="s2">of issues they they have contributed and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.520" end="00:21:55.500" style="s2">how much other people have valued their</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.130" end="00:22:02.820" style="s2">opinion and how maybe at some point even</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.500" end="00:22:05.100" style="s2">how accurate it was and then their their</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.820" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">feedback of how it will influence things</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.100" end="00:22:12.840" style="s2">or so might be then a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">taken into consideration right so some</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.840" end="00:22:16.770" style="s2">sort of an expert tracking system under</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:18.870" style="s2">the hood where you you&#39;re sure that what</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.770" end="00:22:20.520" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing is you know at least pass</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.870" end="00:22:23.010" style="s2">through someone who knows about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.520" end="00:22:24.510" style="s2">topic and not just the tyranny of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.010" end="00:22:27.660" style="s2">reddit upvote and downvote</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.510" end="00:22:29.670" style="s2">yeah okay so talked about identify the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.660" end="00:22:32.160" style="s2">problem is gathering ideas then you want</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.670" end="00:22:37.380" style="s2">to sort of vote or rank those ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.160" end="00:22:39.900" style="s2">within the community after some period</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.380" end="00:22:41.400" style="s2">of time you would then have a winner and</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.900" end="00:22:47.070" style="s2">the idea is that people would take</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.400" end="00:22:49.980" style="s2">action using the winning idea yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.070" end="00:22:52.830" style="s2">only the winning idea they can take</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.980" end="00:22:57.809" style="s2">action on the I feel like any</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.830" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">my net positive points yeah okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.809" end="00:23:03.029" style="s2">take action on one of the points then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.580" style="s2">needs to be validated validated that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.029" end="00:23:07.140" style="s2">actually did take action so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.580" end="00:23:08.279" style="s2">community can say yeah we know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.140" end="00:23:12.539" style="s2">that they did it and they are just</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.279" end="00:23:14.340" style="s2">saying it and then based on the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.539" end="00:23:16.169" style="s2">number of points that idea has in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.340" end="00:23:18.690" style="s2">positive that&#39;s the the number of points</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.169" end="00:23:22.350" style="s2">that person or is each person that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.690" end="00:23:25.710" style="s2">completes that that idea that&#39;s how many</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.350" end="00:23:29.610" style="s2">points do get yeah okay and then the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.710" end="00:23:32.850" style="s2">point they don&#39;t have any like monetary</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.610" end="00:23:34.350" style="s2">value outside of this system right so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.850" end="00:23:36.149" style="s2">there&#39;s no like it doesn&#39;t cost you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.350" end="00:23:39.059" style="s2">money to assign points the points just</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.149" end="00:23:41.429" style="s2">have no intrinsic value until as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.059" end="00:23:43.559" style="s2">said like probably about five years when</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.429" end="00:23:46.200" style="s2">they&#39;ll start to sort of have like Oh as</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.559" end="00:23:47.250" style="s2">points start to build up people will</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.200" end="00:23:48.840" style="s2">figure out what they want to do with</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.250" end="00:23:52.529" style="s2">those coins in what they&#39;re worth yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.840" end="00:23:55.260" style="s2">yeah I do think that I do want those</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.529" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">points to be tradable in a certain way</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">and right and exactly so I yeah I hope</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:03.419" style="s2">they at some point will gain I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:05.909" style="s2">forgot what my reasoning actually for</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.419" end="00:24:08.700" style="s2">this was but I I thought yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.909" end="00:24:13.019" style="s2">should they should have at some point</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.700" end="00:24:15.000" style="s2">have some intrinsic value right are the</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.019" end="00:24:18.750" style="s2">points cryptocurrency or the points the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.000" end="00:24:20.340" style="s2">up and down votes the net positive the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.750" end="00:24:24.380" style="s2">up and down votes and the net positive</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:29.700" style="s2">would be translated into cryptocurrency</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.380" end="00:24:34.289" style="s2">so if there are 50 positive up and down</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.700" end="00:24:37.500" style="s2">votes a words for an issue then that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.289" end="00:24:40.260" style="s2">person would get 50 tokens 50</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.500" end="00:24:43.950" style="s2">cryptocurrency tokens and is it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.260" end="00:24:45.690" style="s2">stop point like we voted we we now know</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.950" end="00:24:47.669" style="s2">there&#39;s a thousand positive votes</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.690" end="00:24:48.870" style="s2">I put action into place I know that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.669" end="00:24:50.700" style="s2">the only one putting action placed on</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.870" end="00:24:52.440" style="s2">getting a thousand votes and the next</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.700" end="00:24:54.299" style="s2">day someone games the system and gives</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.440" end="00:24:55.889" style="s2">it five thousand negative votes does</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.299" end="00:24:59.220" style="s2">that money get taken or those that</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.889" end="00:25:01.500" style="s2">currency get taken from me no I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.220" end="00:25:04.250" style="s2">that&#39;s the three month lag he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.500" end="00:25:04.250" style="s2">talking about I believe</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.150" end="00:25:12.390" style="s2">Esther said that if issues change too</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.330" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">fast or if it has been a thousand in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.390" end="00:25:18.110" style="s2">positive for a while and then yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:22.350" style="s2">someone gives it suddenly 5,000 negative</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.110" end="00:25:27.030" style="s2">then it will still stay a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.350" end="00:25:31.140" style="s2">positive for a few months and also it</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.030" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">once you have the token you you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.140" end="00:25:39.980" style="s2">suddenly lose it i yeah is there any</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.340" end="00:25:46.200" style="s2">where this is there any like planned</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.830" end="00:25:48.360" style="s2">factor and not just how popular the idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.200" end="00:25:50.580" style="s2">is but how popular or important the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.360" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">problem is right so if I come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.580" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">problem for like I can&#39;t get my tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:56.490" style="s2">to grow and it gets ten thousand you</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:58.380" style="s2">know points for the idea because that</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.490" end="00:26:00.450" style="s2">person has a you know great knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.380" end="00:26:01.890" style="s2">how to grow tomatoes and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.450" end="00:26:04.260" style="s2">else says I want to solve climate change</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.890" end="00:26:06.090" style="s2">and the ideas are a bit more you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.260" end="00:26:09.140" style="s2">controversial and they don&#39;t get quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.090" end="00:26:12.420" style="s2">as many like you know it&#39;s 58 percent</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.140" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">sorry forty two percent fifty percent</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.420" end="00:26:19.650" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s some you know the if the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:22.770" style="s2">tomato growing idea had way more points</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.650" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">than this these solutions for climate</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.770" end="00:26:27.300" style="s2">change I&#39;m imagining people would be a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:29.310" style="s2">lot more likely to go after the things</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.300" end="00:26:30.690" style="s2">that have the highest points as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.310" end="00:26:33.420" style="s2">to going after the things that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.690" end="00:26:35.400" style="s2">have the the greatest capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.420" end="00:26:40.730" style="s2">change and improvement does that make</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.400" end="00:26:43.890" style="s2">sense yeah generally I would think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.730" end="00:26:48.870" style="s2">issues like climate change there they</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.890" end="00:26:52.190" style="s2">will have much more participation and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.870" end="00:26:57.000" style="s2">thus a much higher amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.190" end="00:26:59.580" style="s2">contributions votes then some my</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.000" end="00:27:03.090" style="s2">tomatoes don&#39;t grow just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.580" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">much easier to find people are more you</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.090" end="00:27:07.920" style="s2">know nobody searches for that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">Tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.920" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also this aspect of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.860" end="00:27:22.220" style="s2">territorial limitation like so I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:25.460" style="s2">there should be a way to limit in what</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.220" end="00:27:27.980" style="s2">territory a solution applies so for</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:31.750" style="s2">example you can discuss in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.980" end="00:27:33.169" style="s2">community and you say like okay here in</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.750" end="00:27:38.299" style="s2">Pasadena</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.169" end="00:27:40.490" style="s2">whatever I&#39;m I want to have some wind</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.299" end="00:27:47.000" style="s2">turbines or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.490" end="00:27:49.669" style="s2">and then that should only be applicable</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.000" end="00:27:54.230" style="s2">in that area and only people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.669" end="00:27:57.529" style="s2">registered to to live in that area so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.230" end="00:28:00.380" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll be able to vote on that put</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.529" end="00:28:05.240" style="s2">potentially something like this um or</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.380" end="00:28:09.409" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to find it easily um and</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.240" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">also there&#39;s this other point of how</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.409" end="00:28:19.100" style="s2">much it is anticipated to cost like some</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:22.190" style="s2">issues for example um say yes or no to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.100" end="00:28:25.610" style="s2">abortion are very controversial and are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.190" end="00:28:28.760" style="s2">likely to have a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.610" end="00:28:33.049" style="s2">contribution but to actually implement</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.760" end="00:28:36.950" style="s2">something it doesn&#39;t cost anything or it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.049" end="00:28:40.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cost much let&#39;s say it does cost</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.950" end="00:28:46.549" style="s2">something because there is lobbying for</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.760" end="00:28:51.159" style="s2">example and then those kind of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.549" end="00:28:55.000" style="s2">they the the community they could put a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.159" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">modifier into that issue of how much a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.000" end="00:29:03.590" style="s2">how much cryptocurrency they would want</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:06.140" style="s2">to put out for this type of thing um and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.590" end="00:29:07.910" style="s2">so they they</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.140" end="00:29:12.049" style="s2">potentially vote on that one as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.910" end="00:29:15.470" style="s2">like by default it might be a factor of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.049" end="00:29:17.660" style="s2">one and then if they think this issue is</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.470" end="00:29:19.220" style="s2">much more important than anything else</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.660" end="00:29:21.410" style="s2">then they give it a road and then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.220" end="00:29:25.940" style="s2">effector will be increased unto one</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.410" end="00:29:28.340" style="s2">point one or will be decreased um and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.940" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">that there should be some mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.340" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">like this to tweak it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:42.140" style="s2">for me the voting system with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.470" end="00:29:44.090" style="s2">currency both of those things can always</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.140" end="00:29:49.100" style="s2">be gamed having both of them together</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.090" end="00:29:51.650" style="s2">seems like it exponentially increases</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.100" end="00:29:53.450" style="s2">both both of those problems and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.650" end="00:29:57.110" style="s2">that it&#39;s not even viable you don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.450" end="00:29:59.570" style="s2">you can&#39;t test it for five years is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.110" end="00:30:01.820" style="s2">issue is there a way to kind of test</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.570" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">those things or start them now like to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.820" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">work through a process of problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:08.750" style="s2">solving for this very thing right like</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.440" end="00:30:09.830" style="s2">the problem is we need a platform or</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.750" end="00:30:12.530" style="s2">something to be able to solve problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.830" end="00:30:14.900" style="s2">on what are the solutions</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.530" end="00:30:17.060" style="s2">what are you know and up and down vote</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.900" end="00:30:18.670" style="s2">them without any currency involved right</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.060" end="00:30:21.050" style="s2">just like hey this one got more</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.670" end="00:30:23.000" style="s2">attention and and figure out what that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.050" end="00:30:25.700" style="s2">goes and then eventually get to an up</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.000" end="00:30:28.100" style="s2">and down vote system of like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.700" end="00:30:29.690" style="s2">getting enough interaction we want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.100" end="00:30:30.740" style="s2">currency involvement right there might</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.690" end="00:30:32.990" style="s2">not even need to be a currency</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.740" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">involvement but if there is what do we</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.990" end="00:30:36.350" style="s2">want there&#39;s people who are currently</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:37.430" style="s2">putting in more time and effort here we</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.350" end="00:30:40.070" style="s2">want to be able to give them more</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.430" end="00:30:45.820" style="s2">incentive right like work through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.070" end="00:30:49.130" style="s2">process with the process yeah that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.820" end="00:30:53.870" style="s2">would probably be quite good to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.130" end="00:30:56.050" style="s2">this process I&#39;m not sure how how it</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.870" end="00:30:59.480" style="s2">could be done i I do have a question</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.050" end="00:31:04.090" style="s2">counter question for you how how do you</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.480" end="00:31:07.970" style="s2">think that system could be gamed</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.090" end="00:31:13.760" style="s2">I mean I can imagine some some things</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.970" end="00:31:15.410" style="s2">myself but I&#39;d be curious about if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.760" end="00:31:17.900" style="s2">the difference between an upvote in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.410" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">down vote and I want to be able to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.900" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">the most money for the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:23.060" style="s2">putting into place one I&#39;m gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:24.560" style="s2">the action that has the least amount of</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.060" end="00:31:25.910" style="s2">people taking impact I&#39;m gonna get all</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.560" end="00:31:27.230" style="s2">of my friends to come and upload it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.910" end="00:31:29.690" style="s2">instead of them and downvote</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.230" end="00:31:31.880" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s it&#39;s quite easy to game</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.690" end="00:31:33.940" style="s2">that system because it&#39;s just based on</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.880" end="00:31:36.200" style="s2">the difference of voting right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.940" end="00:31:38.450" style="s2">growing a garden in your backyard is</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.200" end="00:31:40.130" style="s2">powerful but at the same time I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.450" end="00:31:42.250" style="s2">think it&#39;s a solution to our food crisis</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.130" end="00:31:44.710" style="s2">cuz I can&#39;t grow a garden in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.250" end="00:31:46.840" style="s2">with my labor so even though it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.710" end="00:31:48.580" style="s2">solution it gets actual calories I might</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.840" end="00:31:51.550" style="s2">down vote people because I&#39;m not able to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.580" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">do it right whereas like growing the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.550" end="00:31:55.480" style="s2">food is an actual solution and so there</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:57.880" style="s2">might be a metric like how many calories</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.480" end="00:32:00.700" style="s2">are you adding to the world then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.880" end="00:32:02.740" style="s2">getting a currency based on that is it</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.700" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">necessarily do people see the value in</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.740" end="00:32:07.870" style="s2">this right because there&#39;s also thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:09.910" style="s2">outside the box and you&#39;re asking people</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.870" end="00:32:11.620" style="s2">is this possible is this is this there</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.910" end="00:32:13.000" style="s2">but like the person with the idea is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.620" end="00:32:15.310" style="s2">one who can kind of see the value other</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.000" end="00:32:16.930" style="s2">people might not and the ones with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.310" end="00:32:18.910" style="s2">of negative down votes might be the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.930" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">actual solution that has the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.910" end="00:32:23.740" style="s2">impact on the actual metrics and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.570" style="s2">there&#39;s always ways to game the system</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.740" end="00:32:27.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s about kind of putting it in</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.570" end="00:32:29.350" style="s2">place and looking for those ways and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.040" end="00:32:31.450" style="s2">finding white hat players to try to game</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.350" end="00:32:35.530" style="s2">the system and give you the rewards for</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.450" end="00:32:38.230" style="s2">getting the system also important to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.530" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">note that gaming is not always done like</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.230" end="00:32:42.070" style="s2">intentionally just as you start to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:44.590" style="s2">measure things as you emphasize them as</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.070" end="00:32:46.150" style="s2">you know if those points are the number</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.590" end="00:32:48.250" style="s2">one thing that you&#39;re saying these are</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.150" end="00:32:50.260" style="s2">kind of the reason for it people will</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.250" end="00:32:52.540" style="s2">naturally gravitate towards trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.260" end="00:32:55.750" style="s2">get the most points if you combine that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.540" end="00:32:57.550" style="s2">with I want to look for albeit the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.750" end="00:32:59.650" style="s2">that have the most points and required</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.550" end="00:33:02.020" style="s2">the least amount of work you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.650" end="00:33:03.940" style="s2">this thin layer of like oh this is where</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.020" end="00:33:05.680" style="s2">it&#39;s at and this is you know if all you</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.940" end="00:33:07.690" style="s2">want is points everyone just focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.680" end="00:33:09.730" style="s2">these ten you know so you have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:11.710" style="s2">people growing tomatoes and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.730" end="00:33:13.780" style="s2">just doing two sort of easier projects</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.710" end="00:33:15.640" style="s2">that got a lot of points and then it</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.780" end="00:33:17.200" style="s2">becomes a well why am I gonna waste my</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.640" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">time on this where even though you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.200" end="00:33:20.140" style="s2">it&#39;s got a lot of points it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:21.820" style="s2">me four weeks but that one&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.140" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">quarter of the points well it&#39;d take me</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.820" end="00:33:31.540" style="s2">an hour I&#39;m gonna go to that one yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:35.020" style="s2">good points I haven&#39;t considered those</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.540" end="00:33:41.140" style="s2">ones that much that&#39;s why I like</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.020" end="00:33:44.440" style="s2">having this red eye I kind of would</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.140" end="00:33:47.650" style="s2">imagine that for example if topic</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.440" end="00:33:50.890" style="s2">growing tomatoes in your backyard at</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.650" end="00:33:54.110" style="s2">some point people will definitely see</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.890" end="00:33:56.190" style="s2">okay there we have enough Tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.110" end="00:33:58.650" style="s2">first of all that we have enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.190" end="00:34:02.820" style="s2">Tomatoes I don&#39;t I really don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.650" end="00:34:06.540" style="s2">vote on this one anymore secondly people</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.820" end="00:34:08.640" style="s2">who grow tomatoes they can&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.540" end="00:34:12.390" style="s2">with those tomatoes because there is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.640" end="00:34:17.220" style="s2">already too much of it they can&#39;t sell</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.390" end="00:34:20.460" style="s2">it that well anymore whatever ergo they</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.220" end="00:34:27.150" style="s2">are profit would go down they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.460" end="00:34:30.420" style="s2">do it so I&#39;m I&#39;m kind of hoping that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.150" end="00:34:32.610" style="s2">de market in some way regulates itself</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.420" end="00:34:37.830" style="s2">after some time and doesn&#39;t go like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.610" end="00:34:40.500" style="s2">completely um out of sync so to say so</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.830" end="00:34:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not just the problem it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.500" end="00:34:43.710" style="s2">the current state of the problems if the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.240" end="00:34:46.290" style="s2">if the problem is we have a tomato</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.710" end="00:34:48.390" style="s2">shortage and a bunch of people take</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.290" end="00:34:50.400" style="s2">action and grow tomatoes and get points</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.390" end="00:34:52.110" style="s2">at a certain point the community says</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.400" end="00:34:54.120" style="s2">all right that&#39;s enough Tomatoes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.110" end="00:35:00.450" style="s2">start downloading that did that idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.120" end="00:35:01.770" style="s2">because that problem solved yeah cuz I</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.450" end="00:35:04.170" style="s2">got from what you said that we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.770" end="00:35:06.030" style="s2">involving the markets actual currency in</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.170" end="00:35:07.920" style="s2">the problem that without necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.030" end="00:35:10.230" style="s2">having it there that somehow the market</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.920" end="00:35:12.420" style="s2">takes care cuz in what you explained I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:14.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t see currents the actual currency</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.420" end="00:35:16.380" style="s2">the American dollar the euro and such as</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.400" end="00:35:17.490" style="s2">you know I mean like if I&#39;m just trying</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.380" end="00:35:19.590" style="s2">to grow tomatoes now there&#39;s too many</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.490" end="00:35:20.730" style="s2">tomatoes in the market but that&#39;s not up</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.590" end="00:35:23.220" style="s2">voting and down voting and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.730" end="00:35:24.990" style="s2">cryptocurrency that&#39;s created for making</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.220" end="00:35:28.680" style="s2">the solution if we&#39;ve up voted tomato</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.990" end="00:35:30.090" style="s2">producing and we grow tomatoes we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.680" end="00:35:32.100" style="s2">the currency doesn&#39;t matter if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.090" end="00:35:33.780" style="s2">room in the market and until there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.100" end="00:35:37.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a mechanism that actually takes</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.780" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">that into place within the system yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.950" end="00:35:45.200" style="s2">you know you are partly right partly</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:47.790" style="s2">wrong on there is definitely at that</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.200" end="00:35:49.800" style="s2">downstream effect of okay you have two</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.790" end="00:35:51.510" style="s2">Tomatoes now what do you do with it so</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.800" end="00:35:53.730" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely the market comes into</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.510" end="00:35:57.380" style="s2">play and then before you are you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.730" end="00:36:00.420" style="s2">right that you in in the way how I</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.380" end="00:36:03.180" style="s2">thought about it you would still get all</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.420" end="00:36:06.940" style="s2">the cryptocurrency all so if we already</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.180" end="00:36:09.880" style="s2">have too much tomato actually um</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.940" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">but yet then at that point I would hope</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.880" end="00:36:14.500" style="s2">that people start to actually download</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:18.400" style="s2">it because they identify the problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.500" end="00:36:23.559" style="s2">they see okay we have too much tomato we</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.400" end="00:36:27.119" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough cucumbers and hold up</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.559" end="00:36:30.369" style="s2">the cucumbers and pour down the tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.119" end="00:36:34.890" style="s2">so after all the whole thing is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.369" end="00:36:38.319" style="s2">to be a problem solution finding thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.890" end="00:36:39.640" style="s2">where they constantly figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.319" end="00:36:47.020" style="s2">awkward solutions to the current</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.640" end="00:36:48.940" style="s2">situation said that last week keep</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.020" end="00:36:50.500" style="s2">keeping the silos open and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.940" end="00:36:53.559" style="s2">there might be my solutions in other</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.500" end="00:37:00.670" style="s2">solutions I don&#39;t know exactly they mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.559" end="00:37:02.740" style="s2">by that but I think that note I think as</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:04.569" style="s2">Jonas said I&#39;m hearing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.740" end="00:37:07.720" style="s2">similarities in between this and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.569" end="00:37:11.859" style="s2">like sort of controversial topic</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.720" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">discussion of wiki election and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.859" end="00:37:15.460" style="s2">topic last week we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">like if we make some sort of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.460" end="00:37:19.270" style="s2">know a council or something where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:22.630" style="s2">saying here&#39;s people who are who are</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.270" end="00:37:25.569" style="s2">working on for example like how to solve</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.630" end="00:37:28.390" style="s2">a problem and and getting you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.569" end="00:37:30.849" style="s2">community ideas and then ranking those</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.390" end="00:37:32.770" style="s2">ideas make sort of a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.849" end="00:37:36.220" style="s2">people that are trying to tackle that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.770" end="00:37:39.579" style="s2">problem in that way and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.220" end="00:37:40.900" style="s2">sort of have a as I said a council where</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.579" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">that there might be three or five or</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.900" end="00:37:44.859" style="s2">however many people who have projects</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:46.150" style="s2">that are trying to solve the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.859" end="00:37:49.299" style="s2">of a problem in the same sort of a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.150" end="00:37:52.900" style="s2">and then it&#39;s meant to kind of be like</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.299" end="00:37:56.470" style="s2">the opposite of the game a you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.900" end="00:37:58.930" style="s2">projects competing take projects in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.470" end="00:38:02.170" style="s2">same space form some sort of a group</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.930" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">around okay in the game a space we will</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.170" end="00:38:06.520" style="s2">be competing but because this is game B</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:09.720" style="s2">how can we actually collaborate knowing</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.520" end="00:38:09.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re working on similar things</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.789" end="00:38:18.190" style="s2">also there is to the whole thing I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.819" end="00:38:20.760" style="s2">100% sure how to do it but there is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.190" end="00:38:23.910" style="s2">kind of thing to localize</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.760" end="00:38:31.350" style="s2">specific issues so throwing Tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.910" end="00:38:33.750" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s both in some way which makes</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.350" end="00:38:36.480" style="s2">it a little bit tricky because on one</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.750" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">hand so so you want to have it as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.480" end="00:38:43.530" style="s2">local solution where there is a tomato</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">shortage say but there is also the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.530" end="00:38:50.130" style="s2">general idea okay growing tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">locally instead of abroad and shipping</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.130" end="00:38:56.820" style="s2">it in is better but in the global</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:59.100" style="s2">context this kind of problem might be</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.820" end="00:39:03.950" style="s2">framed in a slightly different way for</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.100" end="00:39:07.130" style="s2">example um more as okay how do we avoid</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.950" end="00:39:13.290" style="s2">carbon emissions by excessive transport</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.130" end="00:39:17.070" style="s2">and then that one can have slightly</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.290" end="00:39:20.850" style="s2">different implementations and rewards on</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.070" end="00:39:26.150" style="s2">this global scale then the local farmer</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.850" end="00:39:26.150" style="s2">that grows it who applies it in Pasadena</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.180" end="00:39:33.720" style="s2">so Eunice I do want to say that I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:35.790" style="s2">the way you described it was like the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.720" end="00:39:38.310" style="s2">initial kind of pitch or that initial</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.790" end="00:39:42.890" style="s2">sentence that chiefly shared I think was</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.310" end="00:39:48.330" style="s2">excellent I think it it fits a lot with</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.890" end="00:39:50.070" style="s2">some it it puts into words kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.330" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.070" end="00:39:54.420" style="s2">in general and I think very much also</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:56.070" style="s2">what jubblies been going through is just</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.420" end="00:39:59.580" style="s2">kind of finding a way to get people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.070" end="00:40:04.170" style="s2">work together on these topics in a way</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.580" end="00:40:07.290" style="s2">that frees them up to do it it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.170" end="00:40:13.050" style="s2">like your focus is kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.290" end="00:40:15.240" style="s2">communication this platform there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.050" end="00:40:16.830" style="s2">something to do that so I just I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.240" end="00:40:21.780" style="s2">wanted to kind of open up the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.830" end="00:40:25.890" style="s2">and say you know is this concept pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.780" end="00:40:29.550" style="s2">much you know one of the the past to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.890" end="00:40:32.220" style="s2">at together tech or you know what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.550" end="00:40:34.270" style="s2">overlap of already ideas the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.220" end="00:40:38.980" style="s2">things that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.270" end="00:40:43.510" style="s2">on where we could collaborate do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.980" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">Jones do you see what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.510" end="00:40:48.250" style="s2">uniquely different from I mean what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:53.200" style="s2">blind Jubilee and I have been doing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.250" end="00:40:54.670" style="s2">not very specific yet but I mean do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.200" end="00:40:56.920" style="s2">kind of see that is that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.670" end="00:40:59.530" style="s2">potential proposal for kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.920" end="00:41:03.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve been groping around for or do you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.530" end="00:41:07.119" style="s2">think it&#39;s different I do think that a</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.700" end="00:41:10.360" style="s2">lot of what we what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.119" end="00:41:20.610" style="s2">discussing definitely flows into this</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.360" end="00:41:22.030" style="s2">and um is a big part of of my problem I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.610" end="00:41:26.770" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.030" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">Yasuda together take more as a you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.770" end="00:41:37.570" style="s2">my thing is one-one tech piece one of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">the projects I could very well imagine</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.570" end="00:41:42.820" style="s2">that together take also heckles</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">all kind of different very different</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.820" end="00:41:48.850" style="s2">projects but yeah what you are talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:51.700" style="s2">about what you&#39;re trying to achieve of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.850" end="00:41:57.130" style="s2">bringing people together and focusing</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.700" end="00:42:00.730" style="s2">their energy onto a on to solving some</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.130" end="00:42:03.340" style="s2">problem or so that is definitely um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.730" end="00:42:07.780" style="s2">very much part of my one as well so</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.340" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.780" end="00:42:12.310" style="s2">back to Canada to what you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:15.190" style="s2">earlier at the beginning is finding a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.310" end="00:42:17.369" style="s2">kind of stair step approach to get there</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.190" end="00:42:23.740" style="s2">which you can&#39;t iterate to everything</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.369" end="00:42:26.470" style="s2">but I was thinking that it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.740" end="00:42:28.930" style="s2">kind of the first well here&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.470" end="00:42:31.510" style="s2">thoughts on how we could step to that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.930" end="00:42:36.580" style="s2">one is to have just a place where you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.510" end="00:42:40.420" style="s2">can put in ideas and vote to say which</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.580" end="00:42:43.390" style="s2">ideas are more important and that would</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.420" end="00:42:46.600" style="s2">be found on the first step and then the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.390" end="00:42:47.770" style="s2">potentially I don&#39;t know which would</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.600" end="00:42:49.900" style="s2">come next</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.770" end="00:42:52.690" style="s2">it would be like the reddits of style</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.900" end="00:42:55.450" style="s2">kind of just discussion and then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.690" end="00:42:58.090" style="s2">the summarizing summarization and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.450" end="00:43:01.660" style="s2">and then build on as a separate piece to</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.090" end="00:43:05.050" style="s2">get into the the implementation and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.660" end="00:43:07.120" style="s2">kind of the the reward system of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.050" end="00:43:13.240" style="s2">cryptocurrency I would see that as kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.120" end="00:43:15.610" style="s2">of a doable step progression yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.240" end="00:43:18.580" style="s2">that that&#39;s kind of a idea and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.610" end="00:43:20.920" style="s2">maybe the first iteration is just you</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.580" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">know here here are the some ideas people</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.920" end="00:43:26.020" style="s2">where I put rank these in whatever order</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:29.320" style="s2">you think that we should tackle them and</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.020" end="00:43:33.580" style="s2">then or or vote or you know however you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.320" end="00:43:35.860" style="s2">want to actually ranking so yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.580" end="00:43:39.700" style="s2">give someone like a hundred points and</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.860" end="00:43:45.160" style="s2">then say allocate these points to these</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.700" end="00:43:47.500" style="s2">ten things however you want and and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.160" end="00:43:49.420" style="s2">and they also give the option to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.500" end="00:43:50.890" style="s2">them kind of add the ability to add new</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.420" end="00:43:52.210" style="s2">ideas and figure out how to do the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.890" end="00:43:56.080" style="s2">curation but I think that would be like</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.210" end="00:44:02.020" style="s2">the first gem of the idea or the</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.080" end="00:44:04.870" style="s2">implantation yeah so firstly I yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.020" end="00:44:08.310" style="s2">also definitely see that there are these</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.870" end="00:44:10.600" style="s2">bits of that can be trialed</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.310" end="00:44:14.940" style="s2">independently and developed</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.600" end="00:44:18.090" style="s2">independently like putting up some</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.940" end="00:44:22.390" style="s2">solutions and then voting on them and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.090" end="00:44:27.610" style="s2">then discussion about that red it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.390" end="00:44:29.950" style="s2">thing um and yeah I think that would</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.610" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">definitely go somewhere along that path</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.950" end="00:44:36.370" style="s2">there&#39;s also for example here in New</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:38.770" style="s2">Zealand&#39;s there was this company or you</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.370" end="00:44:42.490" style="s2">seen in Australia the company horizon</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.770" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">state it actually tried they tried to</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.490" end="00:44:49.950" style="s2">implement voting with cryptocurrency as</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.330" end="00:44:57.790" style="s2">it&#39;s input kind of thing that was also</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.330" end="00:45:01.630" style="s2">interesting on there are a few few</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.790" end="00:45:06.130" style="s2">projects that I would hope at some point</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.630" end="00:45:09.670" style="s2">to connect with um to so that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.130" end="00:45:12.310" style="s2">even have to develop that thing but just</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.670" end="00:45:15.100" style="s2">you know see how they are doing it how</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.310" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">what problems they run into um can we</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.100" end="00:45:20.280" style="s2">make it better can we use it exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:26.220" style="s2">they do it and then take it from there</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.280" end="00:45:28.690" style="s2">the thing with giving people a hundred a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.220" end="00:45:29.980" style="s2">hundred volts and they can distribute it</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.690" end="00:45:32.140" style="s2">as a service was actually also something</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.980" end="00:45:34.600" style="s2">that I did I thought about I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.140" end="00:45:39.730" style="s2">when I even wrote it in deep paper I</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.600" end="00:45:42.730" style="s2">wrote it down somewhere at least I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.730" end="00:45:46.210" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely one one possibility</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.730" end="00:45:50.700" style="s2">how to do it I also thought a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.210" end="00:45:54.190" style="s2">about whether that should be the same as</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.700" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">the actual crypto token in the end to</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.190" end="00:46:04.570" style="s2">have some yet to really have value</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.670" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">behind where they put their votes but</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.570" end="00:46:11.320" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m also uh I&#39;m also a bit afraid</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:14.530" style="s2">of sometimes people really gaming the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.320" end="00:46:16.630" style="s2">system and especially the more the money</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.530" end="00:46:20.380" style="s2">and the votes come together the more</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.630" end="00:46:24.870" style="s2">dangerous but yeah there might be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.380" end="00:46:24.870" style="s2">really really good possibility there um</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.360" end="00:46:36.970" style="s2">but there&#39;s um why not start a subreddit</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.950" end="00:46:39.430" style="s2">like starting like a solution subreddit</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.970" end="00:46:41.530" style="s2">where we focus on one solution and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.430" end="00:46:43.090" style="s2">or like sorry one problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.530" end="00:46:44.980" style="s2">people can can offer solutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.090" end="00:46:46.510" style="s2">underneath and have one per week and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.980" end="00:46:48.580" style="s2">even if you&#39;re not actually solving the</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.510" end="00:46:50.260" style="s2">problem just looking at what that looks</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.580" end="00:46:52.570" style="s2">like and then I&#39;m just trying to find it</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.260" end="00:46:54.670" style="s2">yellow where there is something like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.570" end="00:46:58.180" style="s2">pros and cons and following it down and</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.670" end="00:46:59.680" style="s2">kind of using those together having a</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.180" end="00:47:01.690" style="s2">subreddit and having the hundred votes</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.680" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">on us for it like using the voting</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.690" end="00:47:05.140" style="s2">systems that exist I don&#39;t know if any</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:05.509" style="s2">of them doing this they can do that with</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.140" end="00:47:09.759" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.509" end="00:47:12.199" style="s2">Oates but playing the spreadsheets doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.759" end="00:47:14.089" style="s2">like playing with it where it is right</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.199" end="00:47:15.859" style="s2">now but in reddit and finding a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.089" end="00:47:17.869" style="s2">community of you know ten and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.859" end="00:47:19.880" style="s2">people to try and try and play with us</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.869" end="00:47:22.489" style="s2">yeah and you could you could even do the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.880" end="00:47:26.299" style="s2">summarization to where you have a Google</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.489" end="00:47:28.369" style="s2">Doc that is allowed for comments but not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.299" end="00:47:31.579" style="s2">edits maybe or you can even allow edits</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.369" end="00:47:33.769" style="s2">because the doctor you can you can go</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.579" end="00:47:35.479" style="s2">back to any version of the doc that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.769" end="00:47:37.130" style="s2">want and them in history so if someone</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.479" end="00:47:39.829" style="s2">goes in those do that so yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.130" end="00:47:42.769" style="s2">could literally do a reddit create a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.829" end="00:47:45.139" style="s2">thread for each topic and there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.769" end="00:47:48.499" style="s2">systems that allows you to allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.139" end="00:47:51.739" style="s2">integrate cut even custom voting systems</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.499" end="00:47:55.669" style="s2">because in change my view they have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.739" end="00:47:57.739" style="s2">Delta system to where you can put deltas</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.669" end="00:48:00.949" style="s2">and then a separate website calculates</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.739" end="00:48:03.499" style="s2">them so you could even go in so you</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.949" end="00:48:06.349" style="s2">could put each topic everyone could put</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.499" end="00:48:07.759" style="s2">in just a like score colon and then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.349" end="00:48:09.439" style="s2">number and then you can create another</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.759" end="00:48:14.749" style="s2">website that would strip that out and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.439" end="00:48:16.009" style="s2">give you totals so yeah we this might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.749" end="00:48:18.889" style="s2">something that we could piece together</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.009" end="00:48:21.439" style="s2">and till we hit the wall of you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.889" end="00:48:22.909" style="s2">hacking all this stuff together and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.439" end="00:48:25.489" style="s2">if there&#39;s some enough momentum from</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.909" end="00:48:27.769" style="s2">them then enough developers or funding</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.489" end="00:48:39.289" style="s2">could break it out into its own tool and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.769" end="00:48:47.299" style="s2">that&#39;s one potential path yeah I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.289" end="00:48:51.019" style="s2">little bit concerned like for example</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.299" end="00:48:56.509" style="s2">and reddit if we go there and just ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.019" end="00:49:02.389" style="s2">people to contribute there that it will</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.509" end="00:49:07.939" style="s2">still be so different that the effect</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.389" end="00:49:12.649" style="s2">that the positive effect of our I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.939" end="00:49:16.959" style="s2">about it might be gone like for example</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.649" end="00:49:19.330" style="s2">that extra click on that Google document</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.959" end="00:49:22.270" style="s2">instead maybe just one</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.330" end="00:49:26.440" style="s2">click too much to actually quickly see</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.270" end="00:49:30.880" style="s2">that thing because a lot of what what in</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.440" end="00:49:33.040" style="s2">the end at least will influence how much</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:35.830" style="s2">participation we get how good it will</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.040" end="00:49:38.920" style="s2">work is also really how convenient it</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.830" end="00:49:43.740" style="s2">will be for people to do things so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.920" end="00:49:48.520" style="s2">is one thing the other thing is the like</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.740" end="00:49:52.510" style="s2">voting and will for example will we then</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.520" end="00:49:56.140" style="s2">see this are that popular person you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.510" end="00:49:58.090" style="s2">know we all know um let&#39;s say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.140" end="00:50:02.080" style="s2">trodden Hall or so would come into that</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.090" end="00:50:05.080" style="s2">one and then we all know him and we kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.080" end="00:50:10.350" style="s2">of let&#39;s just vote for his idea because</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.080" end="00:50:14.710" style="s2">you know he&#39;s clever something like that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.350" end="00:50:18.760" style="s2">so I am I really like I would really</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.710" end="00:50:20.230" style="s2">like to do that um to as you said to</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.760" end="00:50:22.590" style="s2">just set something up and read it and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.230" end="00:50:28.210" style="s2">then have that Google Talk and try it um</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.590" end="00:50:31.540" style="s2">but how do you see those those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.210" end="00:50:33.940" style="s2">factors that are just sets well how much</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.540" end="00:50:35.410" style="s2">of a problem is that yeah I mean I I</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.940" end="00:50:37.480" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s that big of a problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.410" end="00:50:39.220" style="s2">anytime you&#39;re you&#39;re starting with kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.480" end="00:50:41.370" style="s2">of an MVP or something it&#39;s understood</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.220" end="00:50:47.560" style="s2">that there&#39;s gonna be added friction and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.370" end="00:50:49.180" style="s2">you&#39;re only going to get you know early</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.560" end="00:50:51.400" style="s2">adopters and people that are willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.180" end="00:50:53.890" style="s2">go through an actual work but I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.400" end="00:50:55.540" style="s2">also if you can&#39;t find anyone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.890" end="00:50:58.030" style="s2">willing to go through those extra clicks</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.540" end="00:51:02.500" style="s2">then that&#39;s kind of a proof point for</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.030" end="00:51:04.870" style="s2">the idea so yeah so it wouldn&#39;t reach</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.500" end="00:51:08.500" style="s2">mass market potential but what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.870" end="00:51:11.230" style="s2">trying to do is get a test so I think if</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.500" end="00:51:13.600" style="s2">you can then get a hundred people that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.230" end="00:51:15.040" style="s2">are willing to do the extra clicks then</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.600" end="00:51:16.990" style="s2">I mean you could automate it some more</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.040" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">tor maybe you&#39;d have an automated app</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.990" end="00:51:21.400" style="s2">that would read this read the latest</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:23.230" style="s2">Google Doc and post it on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.400" end="00:51:25.390" style="s2">itself and then just have like an edit</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.230" end="00:51:27.700" style="s2">button that would be the link to the doc</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.390" end="00:51:29.770" style="s2">you know you could slowly iterate it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.700" end="00:51:33.339" style="s2">then eventually take it out but I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.770" end="00:51:35.769" style="s2">I think there should if an idea</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.339" end="00:51:37.690" style="s2">is gonna work it has to be compelling</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.769" end="00:51:39.039" style="s2">enough that there will be some diehard</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.690" end="00:51:43.180" style="s2">people that are willing to do the extra</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.039" end="00:51:46.569" style="s2">work now Jubilee is is an example of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.180" end="00:51:49.420" style="s2">someone who is more verbal than audio so</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.569" end="00:51:52.150" style="s2">having a text-based system would kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.420" end="00:51:55.569" style="s2">bias against those people but although</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.150" end="00:51:58.809" style="s2">if we combine this with the with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.569" end="00:52:00.700" style="s2">scheduler that we&#39;ve talked about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.809" end="00:52:04.479" style="s2">where people could then easily schedule</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.700" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">online you know things then you know a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.479" end="00:52:10.029" style="s2">person that&#39;s good in both those areas</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:11.710" style="s2">that&#39;s also good a documentation would</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.029" end="00:52:13.619" style="s2">be the person from that group that would</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.710" end="00:52:15.549" style="s2">go and update it so it kind of combined</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.619" end="00:52:16.779" style="s2">both those ideas but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.549" end="00:52:18.579" style="s2">there&#39;s I think there&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.779" end="00:52:20.380" style="s2">friction but if an idea doesn&#39;t survive</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.579" end="00:52:23.769" style="s2">through some friction it&#39;s probably not</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.380" end="00:52:26.289" style="s2">going to survive I think also when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.769" end="00:52:29.019" style="s2">have a system like that the subreddit is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.289" end="00:52:31.059" style="s2">built for problem solving then people</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.019" end="00:52:34.269" style="s2">are also generating those problems and</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.059" end="00:52:35.739" style="s2">solving them right like like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.269" end="00:52:38.680" style="s2">want Jordan Hall to have more say than</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.739" end="00:52:40.599" style="s2">anybody else and so how do we have and</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.680" end="00:52:42.579" style="s2">that becomes part of the conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.599" end="00:52:45.069" style="s2">when we create our own platform that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.579" end="00:52:46.029" style="s2">have the anonymity to it right that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.069" end="00:52:48.309" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many people have voted</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.029" end="00:52:51.279" style="s2">for maybe you don&#39;t know who said it but</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.309" end="00:52:52.509" style="s2">they&#39;re generated from the community so</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.279" end="00:52:56.200" style="s2">there&#39;s you don&#39;t have to sell it to</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.509" end="00:52:59.229" style="s2">them like it&#39;s it&#39;s already like hey we</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.200" end="00:53:01.210" style="s2">don&#39;t want someone with more eyes to</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.229" end="00:53:02.829" style="s2">actually get more power or how do we</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.210" end="00:53:04.779" style="s2">minimize this effect and you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.829" end="00:53:06.849" style="s2">looking to the system to solve the</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.779" end="00:53:11.229" style="s2">system which in and of itself is</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.849" end="00:53:13.239" style="s2">empowering I can also find a lot of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.229" end="00:53:14.950" style="s2">the real-world examples of what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.239" end="00:53:16.690" style="s2">content you&#39;re seeing like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.950" end="00:53:18.579" style="s2">want to handle it if two people submit a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.690" end="00:53:20.890" style="s2">similar problem or a very similar idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.579" end="00:53:22.839" style="s2">and how do you want to correlate those</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.890" end="00:53:25.119" style="s2">two on Reddit you just start off with</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.839" end="00:53:26.469" style="s2">right which one has the most votes you</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.119" end="00:53:28.420" style="s2">start to see what the community will</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.469" end="00:53:30.279" style="s2">actually do we&#39;ll probably have like</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:32.589" style="s2">comment chains chart to reference each</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.279" end="00:53:37.240" style="s2">other and start to get an idea of how</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.589" end="00:53:39.880" style="s2">things need to be connected I was</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.240" end="00:53:42.340" style="s2">so envisioning something along with a</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.880" end="00:53:44.530" style="s2">subreddit where there is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.340" end="00:53:46.420" style="s2">you first let&#39;s say how the community</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.530" end="00:53:48.010" style="s2">submit problems and then you vote on</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.420" end="00:53:49.870" style="s2">which problems the biggest problem that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.010" end="00:53:52.930" style="s2">week and then ueb you&#39;re focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.870" end="00:53:54.520" style="s2">solving giving solutions to that one</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:56.890" style="s2">like where it&#39;s a little more structured</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.520" end="00:53:59.710" style="s2">your first having like monday we vote on</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.890" end="00:54:02.050" style="s2">which project is or which problem is the</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.710" end="00:54:04.030" style="s2">biggest problem then we should also</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.050" end="00:54:07.180" style="s2">tackle on a sub run it right and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.030" end="00:54:09.850" style="s2">have people submit their solution and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.180" end="00:54:13.030" style="s2">then we vote on on that piece because</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.850" end="00:54:16.090" style="s2">there&#39;s already gonna be not a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.030" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">community doing this having 17 different</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.090" end="00:54:20.200" style="s2">problems going often and</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:22.360" style="s2">cross-referencing will be dissipating</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.200" end="00:54:24.300" style="s2">that energy but maybe that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.360" end="00:54:26.500" style="s2">what we want to play with I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.300" end="00:54:29.320" style="s2">sort of like put an upper limit on how</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.500" end="00:54:31.690" style="s2">much of this extra work involved because</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:33.160" style="s2">if there&#39;s no system in place it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.690" end="00:54:35.050" style="s2">like it&#39;s going to be Jonas doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.160" end="00:54:39.360" style="s2">at least the first couple trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.050" end="00:54:44.890" style="s2">a limit so there&#39;s not 10,000 ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.360" end="00:54:48.340" style="s2">yeah okay so what one thing that I was</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.890" end="00:54:52.840" style="s2">also I am always a bit concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.340" end="00:54:56.650" style="s2">is the the uptake and so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.840" end="00:55:02.620" style="s2">we talk about doing this test project</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.650" end="00:55:06.330" style="s2">now on reddit like is there even a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.620" end="00:55:10.150" style="s2">problem that those four among stars or</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.330" end="00:55:13.450" style="s2">that we would want to tackle and this</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.150" end="00:55:16.200" style="s2">like that we would want to vote on I I</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.450" end="00:55:27.100" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s quite difficult to find</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.200" end="00:55:29.950" style="s2">something that people they I invested if</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.100" end="00:55:34.950" style="s2">it&#39;s either something that affects them</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.950" end="00:55:37.840" style="s2">directly is something more local or if</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.950" end="00:55:40.120" style="s2">if it&#39;s something global climate change</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.840" end="00:55:43.870" style="s2">whatever if there are many people</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.120" end="00:55:48.550" style="s2">involved like for us for it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.870" end="00:55:50.090" style="s2">necessarily make a lot of sense to you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.550" end="00:55:56.000" style="s2">know to vote on okay go</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.090" end="00:56:00.500" style="s2">let&#39;s let&#39;s make flying more expensive</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.000" end="00:56:02.810" style="s2">because we cut so so we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.500" end="00:56:05.930" style="s2">start tackling that that problem even</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.810" end="00:56:08.780" style="s2">and then it also doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.930" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">talk about a local issue of growing</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.780" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">tomatoes or not because we are all in</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:17.480" style="s2">completely different areas we have</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">completely different problems so is</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.480" end="00:56:25.970" style="s2">there a I&#39;m struggling with this of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:32.120" style="s2">finding this kind of my idea will work</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.970" end="00:56:36.470" style="s2">with a lot of people but how to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.120" end="00:56:42.020" style="s2">there and how I somehow I struggle with</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.470" end="00:56:45.320" style="s2">seeing it working in even a X you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.020" end="00:56:47.030" style="s2">trial where you&#39;re so in a small I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.320" end="00:56:48.650" style="s2">I think you just started to build the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.030" end="00:56:50.090" style="s2">framework with like okay it can&#39;t be too</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.650" end="00:56:52.100" style="s2">local it can&#39;t be too big is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.090" end="00:56:54.530" style="s2">this set the framework and then just</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.100" end="00:56:57.020" style="s2">that&#39;s your first test of the community</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.530" end="00:56:59.900" style="s2">is hey within this framework what ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.020" end="00:57:01.430" style="s2">do you as the people of a reddit want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.900" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">see and then you&#39;ve got the up votes and</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.430" end="00:57:04.940" style="s2">then you can start you know moderate and</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:06.770" style="s2">say oh that climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.940" end="00:57:08.390" style="s2">interesting maybe a bit big for right</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.770" end="00:57:10.070" style="s2">now I don&#39;t want to you know manually</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.390" end="00:57:12.950" style="s2">moderate a hundred thousand comments so</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.070" end="00:57:14.270" style="s2">maybe not climate change yet but you</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.950" end="00:57:16.250" style="s2">know what else I mean as you start to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.270" end="00:57:18.500" style="s2">get ideas oh if somebody you know it</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.250" end="00:57:20.930" style="s2">might be very regional but as long as</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.500" end="00:57:22.190" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a smaller one it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.930" end="00:57:24.290" style="s2">have to be perfect but it just has to</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.190" end="00:57:25.670" style="s2">exist and then you can start okay the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.290" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">first one where that one wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.670" end="00:57:28.760" style="s2">good how can I ask it differently how</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.680" end="00:57:32.390" style="s2">can I do it differently how could I</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.760" end="00:57:34.030" style="s2">improve on the previous one I also think</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.390" end="00:57:36.110" style="s2">you can you can break it like if your</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.030" end="00:57:41.390" style="s2">climate change is what we want to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.110" end="00:57:43.130" style="s2">we can also look at what are the things</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.390" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">that needs to be right we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.130" end="00:57:46.970" style="s2">power I making laws of other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:48.950" style="s2">rare traveling but we could choose our</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.970" end="00:57:50.630" style="s2">own air travel right so we could have</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.950" end="00:57:53.150" style="s2">some power in air travel just on on</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.630" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">other people&#39;s choices so it&#39;s breaking</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.150" end="00:57:57.380" style="s2">down where is our power what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:58:03.020" style="s2">problem do we want to tackle that like</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.380" end="00:58:03.559" style="s2">individuals have a saying and like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.020" end="00:58:04.969" style="s2">is you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.559" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">I mean like the first problem it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.969" end="00:58:10.910" style="s2">what are the components we need in a</p>
