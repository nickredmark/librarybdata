<p begin="00:00:01.159" end="00:00:06.330" style="s2">so the first question is how would you</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.570" end="00:00:08.580" style="s2">define self-deception and how is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:10.290" style="s2">different from say cognitive dissonance</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.580" end="00:00:13.349" style="s2">okay well we&#39;ll start with the first one</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.290" end="00:00:16.470" style="s2">how would you define self-deception well</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.349" end="00:00:18.199" style="s2">in most accounts of self-deception most</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">accounts of self-deception have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.199" end="00:00:24.750" style="s2">basically formulated by logicians</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">and the logicians make a presumption and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.750" end="00:00:31.170" style="s2">the presumption is essentially that</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:34.110" style="s2">people think in in fully articulated</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.170" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">statements propositions you might say</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.110" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">and as soon as you accept that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:41.129" style="s2">run into the paradoxes of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.440" style="s2">so for example it doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.129" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">seem possible to believe proposition a</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:48.629" style="s2">and proposition B at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.870" style="s2">those would be stable propositions if</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.629" end="00:00:54.449" style="s2">they conflict with one another but that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.870" end="00:00:57.500" style="s2">begs a number of questions and one is</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.449" end="00:00:59.789" style="s2">first whether or not people think in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.500" end="00:01:02.969" style="s2">propositions in fully articulated</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.789" end="00:01:04.619" style="s2">propositions which they do but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.969" end="00:01:07.549" style="s2">the only way they think and then also</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.619" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">what does it mean for two things to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.549" end="00:01:12.869" style="s2">conflict so I&#39;m gonna start with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:13.320" style="s2">second answering the second question</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.869" end="00:01:17.000" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.320" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">so often when I&#39;ve read badly written</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.000" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">essays often undergraduate essays one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:26.250" style="s2">the things that occurs very frequently</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:29.189" style="s2">is that the writer will make a statement</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.250" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">on page one or paragraph one and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.189" end="00:01:34.500" style="s2">two paragraphs later write a statement</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:38.040" style="s2">that directly contradicts the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.500" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2">statement and because their thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.040" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">confused because they&#39;re young and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">because they don&#39;t know how to write and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:47.340" style="s2">aren&#39;t particularly careful they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">notice that the two propositions</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.340" end="00:01:51.720" style="s2">actually are a logical conflict and one</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">of the things that indicates is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.720" end="00:01:55.170" style="s2">people actually don&#39;t know this when</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:01:57.990" style="s2">things are in logical conflict because</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.170" end="00:02:02.090" style="s2">there&#39;s no marker for that the only time</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.990" end="00:02:03.960" style="s2">people notice that their their</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.090" end="00:02:06.899" style="s2">presuppositions about the world are in</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.960" end="00:02:09.149" style="s2">conflict is when they try to act out two</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.899" end="00:02:12.420" style="s2">contradictory notions at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.149" end="00:02:13.950" style="s2">and find out that acting one out</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.420" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">interferes with acting</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.950" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">another out and sometimes that happens</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">because they&#39;re in conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">themselves but even more often it</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:25.290" style="s2">happens because they become they enter</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:26.670" style="s2">into conflict with someone else so you</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.290" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">might say that you don&#39;t even notice</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.670" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">your propositional conflicts until you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">act them out in the world stops you okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">so so you can you can you can maintain</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">contradictory cognitions endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:44.910" style="s2">without ever noticing how disorganized</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">you are because the world doesn&#39;t slap</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.910" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">you in the face for your foolishness</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">unless you try to act those things out</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">so the idea that self-deception is</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:58.250" style="s2">impossible because people can&#39;t hold two</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">contradictory propositions</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.250" end="00:03:03.380" style="s2">simultaneously that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:06.750" style="s2">ridiculous people do that all the time</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.380" end="00:03:08.250" style="s2">so then that&#39;s the answer to the second</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.750" end="00:03:13.799" style="s2">question and the answer to the first</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.250" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">question is the way that people</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.799" end="00:03:18.810" style="s2">generally deceive themselves is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">they act out a series of propositions so</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.810" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">say a series of beliefs about the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:25.700" style="s2">or even one belief about the world and</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:29.430" style="s2">then they run into evidence that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.700" end="00:03:32.730" style="s2">enacted belief is not having the result</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.430" end="00:03:37.489" style="s2">desired so let&#39;s say you tell a joke at</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:40.530" style="s2">a party and no one laughs and your</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.489" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">proposition was that the joke was funny</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.530" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">and obviously the world indicated to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">that something about that proposition</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">was faulty now the problem is in part</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:55.769" style="s2">that the world doesn&#39;t tell you which</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">part of that proposition is wrong it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.769" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">just tells you that the frame of</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:03.060" style="s2">reference that you were using when you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:04.650" style="s2">were telling the joke had something</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.060" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">wrong had something about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.650" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">that was sufficiently erroneous so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:10.260" style="s2">you didn&#39;t get the result that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:12.150" style="s2">intended but that subject all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.260" end="00:04:14.670" style="s2">potential interpretations and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.150" end="00:04:19.739" style="s2">that&#39;s a situation where a classic</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.670" end="00:04:22.940" style="s2">situation where the the data which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.739" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">the outcome of your joke is</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.940" end="00:04:25.940" style="s2">insufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.840" end="00:04:36.220" style="s2">infirmity to precisely indicate to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.090" end="00:04:37.510" style="s2">where that your mistake was made so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.220" end="00:04:39.100" style="s2">subject to all sorts of potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.510" end="00:04:41.740" style="s2">interpretations and one interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.100" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">could be all these people at this party</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.740" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">are too stupid to understand my humor</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:48.130" style="s2">proposition although it&#39;s unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:50.950" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.130" end="00:04:55.150" style="s2">now generally what people do when they</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.950" end="00:04:57.760" style="s2">deceive themselves is that they they lay</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.150" end="00:04:59.410" style="s2">forth a belief in the world and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.760" end="00:05:01.960" style="s2">results aren&#39;t what they intended and</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.410" end="00:05:04.120" style="s2">that produces a negative emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.960" end="00:05:06.100" style="s2">and the negative emotional state</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.120" end="00:05:08.050" style="s2">indicates an error but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.100" end="00:05:10.330" style="s2">whole process of exploration that has to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.050" end="00:05:13.390" style="s2">occur to precisely specify the error and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.330" end="00:05:16.180" style="s2">to precisely specify how the information</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.390" end="00:05:18.760" style="s2">about the error could be used to revamp</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.180" end="00:05:20.710" style="s2">the whole propositional sequence and</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.760" end="00:05:23.230" style="s2">that takes a tremendous amount of work</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:24.850" style="s2">like a ridiculous amount of work because</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.230" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">let&#39;s say people don&#39;t laugh at your</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.850" end="00:05:27.610" style="s2">jokes</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:28.900" style="s2">well why is that well maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.610" end="00:05:32.050" style="s2">hanging around with the wrong sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.900" end="00:05:33.970" style="s2">people or maybe your jokes just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.050" end="00:05:35.380" style="s2">that funny or maybe you&#39;re kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.970" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">jerk or maybe you don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.380" end="00:05:39.910" style="s2">about social interaction and all of</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">those possibilities emerge when your</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.910" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">joke falls flat and in order for you to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:47.950" style="s2">fully investigate the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.410" style="s2">that you have to do a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.950" end="00:05:52.030" style="s2">of cognitive work and so generally what</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.410" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">happens is that people just don&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.030" end="00:05:59.380" style="s2">work and then what they do is they they</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:02.410" style="s2">they have as a representation of their</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.380" end="00:06:04.360" style="s2">failure what you might describe as what</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.410" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">you might describe as an encounter with</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:11.980" style="s2">chaos and the encounter is negative</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2">emotion emergency preparation and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.980" end="00:06:16.680" style="s2">complete indeterminacy as to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:21.430" style="s2">propositional nature of the information</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.680" end="00:06:23.770" style="s2">now if you do that enough times so you</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.430" end="00:06:26.190" style="s2">lay out your belief and they fail and</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.770" end="00:06:29.770" style="s2">you get a negative emotional response</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.190" end="00:06:32.140" style="s2">personally but you fail to engage in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.770" end="00:06:34.419" style="s2">difficult process of exploration to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.140" end="00:06:35.860" style="s2">specify exactly what went wrong what</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.419" end="00:06:38.110" style="s2">will happen is that you&#39;ll collect</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.860" end="00:06:39.169" style="s2">around yourself an absolute morass of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:41.990" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.169" end="00:06:44.449" style="s2">an indeterminate experience and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.990" end="00:06:46.520" style="s2">the place that you will end up living</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.449" end="00:06:47.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s what self-deception really</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.520" end="00:06:50.120" style="s2">looks like it doesn&#39;t look like you</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.960" end="00:06:53.090" style="s2">believe a and B at the same time and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.120" end="00:06:55.969" style="s2">know you you don&#39;t notice it&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.090" end="00:06:57.949" style="s2">complicated than that and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.969" end="00:07:00.110" style="s2">that&#39;s akin to cognitive dissonance but</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.949" end="00:07:02.629" style="s2">the explanation that I just provided is</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.110" end="00:07:05.479" style="s2">far more thorough than the typical</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.629" end="00:07:07.310" style="s2">explanation of cognitive dissonance so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.479" end="00:07:09.349" style="s2">so that&#39;s an answer to Mike&#39;s question</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.310" end="00:07:10.849" style="s2">how would you define self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.349" end="00:07:19.189" style="s2">how is that different from cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.849" end="00:07:21.710" style="s2">dissonance so one of the things you guys</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.189" end="00:07:23.839" style="s2">might want to do is type more than one</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.710" end="00:07:25.639" style="s2">question don&#39;t wait to type a few and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.839" end="00:07:28.669" style="s2">then I can select from there&#39;s people in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.639" end="00:07:30.439" style="s2">the room with me here so which would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.669" end="00:07:33.710" style="s2">the case under normal circumstances but</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.439" end="00:07:39.259" style="s2">we&#39;re just testing this so any other</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.710" end="00:07:42.409" style="s2">questions do you think some people seek</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.259" end="00:07:44.149" style="s2">out drama eg they make things difficult</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.409" end="00:07:46.849" style="s2">for themselves because they confuse it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.149" end="00:07:49.639" style="s2">with meaning yes people do that all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.849" end="00:07:56.089" style="s2">time is it because they confuse it with</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.639" end="00:07:57.469" style="s2">meaning yes partly that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.089" end="00:07:59.500" style="s2">really complicated question that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.469" end="00:07:59.500" style="s2">asking</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.560" end="00:08:05.839" style="s2">the problem with okay so so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.469" end="00:08:09.080" style="s2">you gave people a choice and the choice</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.839" end="00:08:10.819" style="s2">could be that they could suffer stupidly</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.080" end="00:08:13.339" style="s2">or they could live a meaningful life and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.819" end="00:08:15.499" style="s2">so you might say well obviously they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.339" end="00:08:18.259" style="s2">gonna pick leave living a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.499" end="00:08:22.009" style="s2">life but it&#39;s not so obvious because one</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.259" end="00:08:23.569" style="s2">of the prices that you pay for living a</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.009" end="00:08:26.389" style="s2">meaningful life is that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.569" end="00:08:28.219" style="s2">adopt responsibility and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.389" end="00:08:30.800" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s attendant on</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.219" end="00:08:33.260" style="s2">living a meaningful life might is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.800" end="00:08:35.659" style="s2">theoretically without limit so for</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.260" end="00:08:37.940" style="s2">example one of the ways that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.659" end="00:08:39.800" style="s2">conceptualized in classic Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.940" end="00:08:41.899" style="s2">is that in order to lead a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.800" end="00:08:44.660" style="s2">life you have to take the world sins</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.899" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">onto yourself and that means that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.660" end="00:08:48.890" style="s2">have to see inside yourself</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">all of the negative potentialities that</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.890" end="00:08:54.680" style="s2">are characterized that being human is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:56.960" style="s2">characterized by and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.680" end="00:08:58.790" style="s2">take responsibility for addressing those</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">and so when Carl Jung talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.790" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">for example you know one of the points</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:04.070" style="s2">he made was that if you do a thorough</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">enough investigation into your own</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.070" end="00:09:08.390" style="s2">faults then you end up scouring what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">the word it&#39;s not scouring precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.390" end="00:09:13.190" style="s2">harrowing he&#39;ll litter as close to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:14.570" style="s2">literally as you might imagine and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.190" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">course that&#39;s a very very very</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.570" end="00:09:19.190" style="s2">unpleasant experience and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:22.580" style="s2">might say well people are going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.190" end="00:09:24.710" style="s2">perfectly well and logically want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.580" end="00:09:27.050" style="s2">avoid that and then they do that using</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.710" end="00:09:28.370" style="s2">all sorts of subterfuge because they</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.050" end="00:09:30.260" style="s2">don&#39;t want to admit to themselves that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.370" end="00:09:32.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not taking any responsibility so</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.260" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">they&#39;ll often generate false crises in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.600" end="00:09:37.190" style="s2">their own life and amplified problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.110" style="s2">beyond necessity so that they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.190" end="00:09:40.970" style="s2">convince themselves that when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.110" end="00:09:42.230" style="s2">effortfully struggling through all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.970" end="00:09:43.910" style="s2">mess that they&#39;re actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.230" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">responsibility for their lives but</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.910" end="00:09:49.400" style="s2">they&#39;re not and so so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:51.370" style="s2">reasons that people might seek out drama</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.400" end="00:09:55.010" style="s2">and make things difficult for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.370" end="00:09:56.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s partly because they confuse it</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.010" end="00:10:00.950" style="s2">with meaning but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.690" end="00:10:03.620" style="s2">multiple levels of horrible self</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.950" end="00:10:08.690" style="s2">deception and confusion and avoidance</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.620" end="00:10:10.490" style="s2">that go along with that what rule do you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.690" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">think diagnosis should play in clinical</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.490" end="00:10:16.070" style="s2">practice oh that&#39;s easy you need it to</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:19.460" style="s2">to get reimbursed by insurance providers</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.070" end="00:10:22.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s about it I shouldn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.460" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">because that&#39;s just people facile</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.400" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of there&#39;s a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:32.390" style="s2">functions diagnosis place part of part</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:36.650" style="s2">of engaging in the process of diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.390" end="00:10:39.110" style="s2">is utilizing classification and you need</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.650" end="00:10:42.130" style="s2">to utilize stable classifications for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.110" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">number of reasons one of them is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.130" end="00:10:45.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t understand anything about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:49.250" style="s2">you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.980" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">without classifying it and even if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.250" end="00:10:52.940" style="s2">classify it incorrectly that might be</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:55.820" style="s2">better than not classifying at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.940" end="00:10:58.210" style="s2">because once it&#39;s classified incorrectly</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.820" end="00:11:00.920" style="s2">you might at least be able to notice</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.210" end="00:11:02.990" style="s2">specifically what&#39;s incorrect about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.920" end="00:11:04.670" style="s2">classification and then rectify it which</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.990" end="00:11:06.529" style="s2">is to say that a bad theory might be</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.670" end="00:11:09.339" style="s2">better than no theory at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.529" end="00:11:11.749" style="s2">but diagnosis also helps you identify</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.339" end="00:11:13.579" style="s2">potential pathways forward so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.749" end="00:11:16.759" style="s2">example if you diagnose someone is agra</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.579" end="00:11:20.660" style="s2">phobic then you have access to the large</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.759" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">wealth of treatment protocols that have</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.660" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">already been developed for agra phobia</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:26.029" style="s2">and that&#39;s very useful</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">it helps you rule out other things and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.029" end="00:11:29.509" style="s2">that that can be extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.980" style="s2">because sometimes someone will come to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.509" end="00:11:32.600" style="s2">see you in the clinical practice and</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.980" end="00:11:34.910" style="s2">they&#39;re just overwhelmed by what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.600" end="00:11:36.889" style="s2">happening to them and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.910" end="00:11:38.870" style="s2">that they&#39;re in chaos they&#39;re suffering</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.889" end="00:11:40.999" style="s2">and they have no idea why and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.870" end="00:11:42.860" style="s2">could say well yeah what&#39;s happening to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.999" end="00:11:46.790" style="s2">you is horrible but it&#39;s precisely this</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.860" end="00:11:48.439" style="s2">kind of horrible and here&#39;s what this</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.790" end="00:11:49.910" style="s2">kind of horrible is like and here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.439" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">you can do about it and here is a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.910" end="00:11:54.519" style="s2">of other people who are also suffering</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:56.899" style="s2">from it and they&#39;ve recovered and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.519" end="00:11:58.100" style="s2">with this kind of horrible there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.899" end="00:12:02.089" style="s2">these other things that you won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.100" end="00:12:04.220" style="s2">to worry about and that&#39;s really that</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.089" end="00:12:07.249" style="s2">can be really helpful for people because</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.220" end="00:12:10.100" style="s2">it narrows the universe of their</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.249" end="00:12:12.500" style="s2">problems from all potential problems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.100" end="00:12:16.279" style="s2">a potentially manageable set of finite</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.500" end="00:12:19.449" style="s2">problems so so the so those are some of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.279" end="00:12:21.620" style="s2">the you some of the reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.449" end="00:12:26.269" style="s2">diagnosis and some of the reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.620" end="00:12:28.699" style="s2">diagnosis is useful so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.269" end="00:12:31.069" style="s2">differentiate between having an actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.699" end="00:12:31.910" style="s2">bad life and having depression make your</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.069" end="00:12:33.709" style="s2">life bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.910" end="00:12:35.660" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.709" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">as well I think you can do that in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.660" end="00:12:40.250" style="s2">multi-dimensional way technically</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.300" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">speaking so and so one of the ways I</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.250" end="00:12:45.800" style="s2">conceptualize that is that you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:49.550" style="s2">people&#39;s human life actually has a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.800" end="00:12:54.279" style="s2">fairly stable and identifiable number of</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.550" end="00:12:57.230" style="s2">characteristics and so some of those are</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.279" end="00:12:59.509" style="s2">you need to engage in trade with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.230" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">people and that in modern culture that</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.509" end="00:13:05.449" style="s2">would generally be formalized as having</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:06.769" style="s2">a career you need to have friends you</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.449" end="00:13:09.529" style="s2">need to have an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.769" end="00:13:12.860" style="s2">you need to be embedded within a family</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.529" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">you have to conjure up something of high</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.860" end="00:13:17.959" style="s2">quality that&#39;s productive to do with</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:20.150" style="s2">your life outside of work you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.959" end="00:13:22.100" style="s2">attend to your physical and mental</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.150" end="00:13:24.529" style="s2">and you have to regulate your use of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.100" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">mind-altering substances like drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.529" end="00:13:30.279" style="s2">alcohol there&#39;s other dimensions but</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:33.110" style="s2">those are pretty decent as an initial</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.279" end="00:13:35.270" style="s2">those serve the purpose quite nicely as</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.110" end="00:13:38.690" style="s2">an additional schema so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.270" end="00:13:40.610" style="s2">talking to someone in say in a clinical</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.690" end="00:13:44.960" style="s2">intake the first thing you want to find</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.610" end="00:13:48.410" style="s2">out is is the person functional on any</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.960" end="00:13:50.450" style="s2">or all of those dimensions and the fewer</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.410" end="00:13:52.279" style="s2">dimensions on which they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.450" end="00:13:55.190" style="s2">functional the more they just have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.279" end="00:13:59.690" style="s2">life and aren&#39;t depressed so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.190" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">no friends and you you have no</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.690" end="00:14:04.250" style="s2">educational history and you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:05.839" style="s2">don&#39;t have an educational history say</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.250" end="00:14:08.330" style="s2">that&#39;s commensurate with your ability or</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.839" end="00:14:11.210" style="s2">maybe you have no abilities you have a</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.330" end="00:14:14.660" style="s2">patchy work history your family is an</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.210" end="00:14:16.460" style="s2">absolute nightmare you you all you do</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.660" end="00:14:19.970" style="s2">with your time is consume drugs and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.460" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">alcohol and you have one or more serious</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.970" end="00:14:25.459" style="s2">physical or mental health problems you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.010" end="00:14:26.779" style="s2">have a your life is has fallen apart and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.459" end="00:14:28.490" style="s2">now you&#39;re going to be suffering because</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.779" end="00:14:32.470" style="s2">of that but to call that depression is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.490" end="00:14:35.000" style="s2">not useful particularly depression</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.470" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">technically speaking could spiral you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.000" end="00:14:40.250" style="s2">into a place where those things are more</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:41.930" style="s2">likely but I would generally I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.250" end="00:14:44.500" style="s2">it&#39;s better to conceptualize depression</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.930" end="00:14:48.080" style="s2">as the mismatch between function and</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.500" end="00:14:50.060" style="s2">emotion so if I did that approximately</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.080" end="00:14:52.040" style="s2">six dimensional analysis with someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.060" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">and I concluded that hey well know if</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.040" end="00:14:56.209" style="s2">this person has friends they may not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:57.980" style="s2">seeing them right now because they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.209" end="00:14:59.240" style="s2">a bad state but they have friends and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.980" end="00:15:01.010" style="s2">their friends are good for them they</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.240" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">have an intimate relationship that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.010" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">functional they have their embedded</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.380" style="s2">within a family that isn&#39;t too</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:09.980" style="s2">pathological they have a job that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.380" end="00:15:11.930" style="s2">principle serves the function of a job</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.980" end="00:15:16.070" style="s2">but maybe that they could even be or had</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.930" end="00:15:17.630" style="s2">been interested in etc that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.070" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">feeling terrible and they&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.630" end="00:15:20.990" style="s2">difficult time getting out of bed I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">would say well that increases the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.990" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">probability that they should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:27.380" style="s2">accurately conceptualized as a depressed</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:30.200" style="s2">and then of course in in a real</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.380" end="00:15:32.030" style="s2">situation the clinical presentation is</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:33.960" style="s2">generally some mixture of those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.030" end="00:15:38.010" style="s2">things but it&#39;s very useful two distinct</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.960" end="00:15:41.460" style="s2">one from another have I read aim Rand</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.010" end="00:15:43.170" style="s2">and if I have what are my thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.460" end="00:15:44.660" style="s2">her philosophy objectivism of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.170" end="00:15:50.100" style="s2">Objectivism</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.660" end="00:15:52.770" style="s2">um aim Rand is an ideologue and she&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.100" end="00:15:55.830" style="s2">interesting ideologue because she&#39;s she</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.770" end="00:15:58.170" style="s2">her ideology runs contrary to the most</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.830" end="00:15:59.730" style="s2">prevalent modern ideology which is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.170" end="00:16:02.640" style="s2">one that underlies political correctness</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.730" end="00:16:04.440" style="s2">and so it&#39;s fun to read Ayn Rand</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.640" end="00:16:07.160" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re hyper irritated by</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.440" end="00:16:10.680" style="s2">political correctness because she</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.160" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">provides almost the perfect antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.680" end="00:16:16.160" style="s2">that but and you know I have some</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:18.210" style="s2">sympathy for her because she wrote in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.160" end="00:16:20.010" style="s2">anti-communist vein and she had her</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.210" end="00:16:22.440" style="s2">reasons because her family was chased</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.010" end="00:16:24.150" style="s2">out of what became the Soviet Union by</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.440" end="00:16:25.830" style="s2">the communists and if I remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.150" end="00:16:27.750" style="s2">correctly had their property stolen and</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.830" end="00:16:33.270" style="s2">all the terrible things that went along</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.750" end="00:16:37.080" style="s2">with that but she writes heroes stories</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.270" end="00:16:39.810" style="s2">of a certain type and the hero story is</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.080" end="00:16:44.250" style="s2">the individual against the collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.810" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">roughly speaking and that&#39;s a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.250" end="00:16:49.320" style="s2">reasonable hero story and it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:52.230" style="s2">one but to think of that as the only</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.320" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">valid hero story in the constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.230" end="00:16:57.300" style="s2">possible hero stories is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:59.340" style="s2">because you can also write a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.300" end="00:17:02.100" style="s2">good story where the collective is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.340" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">relatively beneficial and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.100" end="00:17:07.050" style="s2">collective and the hero against say that</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.290" end="00:17:10.500" style="s2">dire forces of nature and that&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.050" end="00:17:12.360" style="s2">perfectly appropriate story so you might</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.500" end="00:17:14.760" style="s2">say that there are circumstances under</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.360" end="00:17:18.030" style="s2">which the attitude that a man puts forth</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:21.209" style="s2">is accurate and salutary but to think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.030" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">that as covering the entire universe of</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.209" end="00:17:26.790" style="s2">potential proper narratives is a big</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:32.940" style="s2">mistake and usually ain&#39;t rands acolytes</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.790" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">do precisely that so Ariel says do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.940" end="00:17:39.000" style="s2">think all presuppositions stem from</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:41.970" style="s2">religion no what I think is that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.000" end="00:17:44.400" style="s2">deepest presuppositions are identical to</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.970" end="00:17:46.770" style="s2">religion that actually when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.400" end="00:17:48.060" style="s2">talk about what constitutes religion</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.770" end="00:17:50.460" style="s2">what we are saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.060" end="00:17:51.810" style="s2">at the same time is that we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.460" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">with the most fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.810" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">presuppositions that people make and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.980" style="s2">thing that I find interesting about that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.940" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">is that presuppositions are necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.980" end="00:18:06.660" style="s2">and the reason for that is that because</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:08.610" style="s2">you have your a finite cognitive agent</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.660" end="00:18:11.190" style="s2">you have extraordinarily limited</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.610" end="00:18:14.430" style="s2">understanding in order to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.190" end="00:18:16.590" style="s2">world at all you have to act as if</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.430" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">certain parts of it are both understood</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.590" end="00:18:24.270" style="s2">and stable like unchanging and those</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:27.030" style="s2">elements that you treat as stable and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:29.190" style="s2">unchanging are at the deepest level are</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.030" end="00:18:31.170" style="s2">your religious presuppositions whether</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.190" end="00:18:34.800" style="s2">you think of them as religious or not is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.170" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">irrelevant if you don&#39;t think of them as</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.800" end="00:18:38.010" style="s2">religious or know that they&#39;re religious</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:39.690" style="s2">all that means is that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.010" end="00:18:40.620" style="s2">anything about your presuppositions and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.690" end="00:18:43.800" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know anything about</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.620" end="00:18:45.360" style="s2">religion and I learned that partly from</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.800" end="00:18:49.920" style="s2">reading Carl Jung because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.360" end="00:18:52.770" style="s2">things Jung posited was that the highest</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.920" end="00:18:55.530" style="s2">value that exists in a person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.770" end="00:18:58.620" style="s2">hierarchy of values is de facto</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.530" end="00:18:59.940" style="s2">equivalent to their God now you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.620" end="00:19:02.100" style="s2">that isn&#39;t often how people</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.940" end="00:19:03.570" style="s2">conceptualize the idea of God or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.100" end="00:19:04.790" style="s2">idea of value but it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.570" end="00:19:06.600" style="s2">matter his point was that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.790" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">psychologically a person&#39;s higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.600" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">highest value served precisely the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:16.440" style="s2">function that a deity serves in you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:20.760" style="s2">in a more explicitly religious society</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.440" end="00:19:23.160" style="s2">so my experience too has been that that</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.760" end="00:19:25.980" style="s2">if you&#39;re ever having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.160" end="00:19:28.190" style="s2">with someone that is really digging</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.190" end="00:19:33.060" style="s2">you the language that has to be used is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.080" end="00:19:34.530" style="s2">immediately religious because religious</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.060" end="00:19:37.140" style="s2">language is the only language that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.370" end="00:19:44.940" style="s2">language has never become necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:47.040" style="s2">you all that means is that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.940" end="00:19:48.930" style="s2">been in the sort of crisis that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.040" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">necessitate its use or that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.930" end="00:19:57.030" style="s2">have the language at hand which is not</p>

<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">they they can&#39;t write and writing is</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:23.120" style="s2">really difficult so you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.470" style="s2">to write and you have to either enjoy it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.120" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">which means there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.470" end="00:23:30.169" style="s2">you or you have to be compelled to do it</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.860" end="00:23:40.429" style="s2">psychotherapy and psychiatry should work</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.809" end="00:23:44.299" style="s2">together in curing psychological</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.429" end="00:23:47.330" style="s2">disorders hmm well I presume that by</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.299" end="00:23:50.510" style="s2">psychiatry what you&#39;re zeroing in on</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.330" end="00:23:52.580" style="s2">there probably is the use of psychiatric</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.510" end="00:23:54.610" style="s2">drugs because otherwise there&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.580" end="00:23:58.850" style="s2">distinction between psychiatry and</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.850" end="00:24:06.970" style="s2">problem you should be very wary of</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.910" end="00:24:21.470" style="s2">you hear very frequently that people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.880" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">all too easily made all too easily seek</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.470" end="00:24:28.249" style="s2">help in the form of pills</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.960" end="00:24:29.869" style="s2">and I just think that&#39;s wrong I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.249" end="00:24:34.539" style="s2">see any evidence for that at all</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.869" end="00:24:40.429" style="s2">in my experience no one comes to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.539" end="00:24:42.440" style="s2">clinician saying please give me a pill</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.429" end="00:24:44.450" style="s2">for my mental illness so it will go away</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.440" end="00:24:45.710" style="s2">first of all people don&#39;t want to think</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.450" end="00:24:47.779" style="s2">even for a moment that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.710" end="00:24:49.610" style="s2">have a mental illness second they</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.779" end="00:24:52.460" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t want to be modified by a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.610" end="00:24:53.720" style="s2">pill and you know they generally feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.460" end="00:24:55.100" style="s2">that that&#39;s an abdication of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.720" end="00:24:56.899" style="s2">responsibility and that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.100" end="00:24:59.149" style="s2">terrified of the side-effects and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.899" end="00:25:01.480" style="s2">even if they do try it they want to get</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.149" end="00:25:06.230" style="s2">off it as fast as possible and that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.480" end="00:25:08.149" style="s2">it&#39;s shameful that they have to be rely</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.230" end="00:25:09.769" style="s2">on some sort of medication to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.149" end="00:25:11.029" style="s2">and so like a lot of what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.769" end="00:25:14.269" style="s2">if you&#39;re dealing with someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.029" end="00:25:17.210" style="s2">truly depressed is helping them come to</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.269" end="00:25:19.190" style="s2">terms with the fact that a trial of an</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.210" end="00:25:21.590" style="s2">antidepressant might be a useful thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.190" end="00:25:27.049" style="s2">for them and that can take months that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.590" end="00:25:29.269" style="s2">can take years so I mean you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.049" end="00:25:35.629" style="s2">to leave any stone unturned in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.269" end="00:25:38.929" style="s2">search for health and psych cycle psyche</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.629" end="00:25:40.970" style="s2">psyche at Rick medications can be very</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.929" end="00:25:46.580" style="s2">useful and sometimes they&#39;re absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.970" end="00:25:48.049" style="s2">necessary so for example your if you</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.580" end="00:25:50.119" style="s2">have someone who is flirting with</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.049" end="00:25:53.990" style="s2">psychosis or who&#39;s already entered a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.119" end="00:25:56.509" style="s2">psychotic state I think the general</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.990" end="00:25:59.019" style="s2">consensus in the literature and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.509" end="00:26:01.879" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate is that if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.019" end="00:26:03.559" style="s2">facilitate their use of anti-psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.879" end="00:26:07.369" style="s2">medication that what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.559" end="00:26:10.700" style="s2">borders on malpractice so now okay so</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.369" end="00:26:12.619" style="s2">having said all that the probability</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.700" end="00:26:16.549" style="s2">that a medication alone will be</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.619" end="00:26:20.509" style="s2">sufficient to address the problem is low</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.549" end="00:26:22.789" style="s2">partly because medications for</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.509" end="00:26:26.259" style="s2">psychiatric disorders are much better</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.789" end="00:26:29.330" style="s2">conceptualized as complex tools than as</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.900" end="00:26:48.680" style="s2">decisions and require a fair bit of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.090" end="00:26:51.680" style="s2">experience to optimize and then you also</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.980" end="00:29:03.970" style="s2">so one of the populations that I&#39;ve had</p>

<p begin="00:29:03.970" end="00:29:10.149" style="s2">worked with a lot of lawyers and these</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.950" end="00:29:13.720" style="s2">are usually very successful hard driving</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.149" end="00:29:15.520" style="s2">ambitious people who are that way for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.720" end="00:29:17.169" style="s2">variety of reasons often because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.520" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">hyper conscientious as well as being</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.169" end="00:29:21.370" style="s2">competitive but they&#39;re almost always at</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:24.370" style="s2">least hyper conscientious and they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.370" end="00:29:25.960" style="s2">other personality attributes and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.370" end="00:29:29.830" style="s2">know one question that a person like</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.960" end="00:29:31.419" style="s2">that addresses is well how hard should I</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.830" end="00:29:34.840" style="s2">work and what am I just being useless</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.419" end="00:29:37.299" style="s2">and the general answer to that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.840" end="00:29:39.429" style="s2">well you should seek some appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.299" end="00:29:43.899" style="s2">work-life balance because that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.429" end="00:29:49.510" style="s2">bloody cliche if you&#39;re in a high highly</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.899" end="00:29:52.690" style="s2">competitive job you&#39;re being chased by</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.510" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">your peers and your clients and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.690" end="00:29:59.110" style="s2">marketplace to work flat out as fast as</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.730" style="s2">you can all the time and so then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.110" end="00:30:02.860" style="s2">question that you have to face is what</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.730" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">why under what conditions should you not</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.860" end="00:30:09.370" style="s2">do that and I found PJ&#39;s thinking very</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:12.580" style="s2">useful in formulating an answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.370" end="00:30:15.510" style="s2">and the fundamental answer is you</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.580" end="00:30:18.039" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t work so hard that you failed</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.510" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">you shouldn&#39;t work so hard that you</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.039" end="00:30:25.899" style="s2">can&#39;t continue to work that hard so if</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:28.990" style="s2">you&#39;re working 80 hours a week and say</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.899" end="00:30:31.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t take a day off you will</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.990" end="00:30:33.549" style="s2">eventually hurt yourself in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.960" end="00:30:35.799" style="s2">that will make it impossible for you to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.549" end="00:30:38.020" style="s2">continue working 80 hours a week so</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.799" end="00:30:39.940" style="s2">that&#39;s obviously counterproductive so</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.020" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">let&#39;s assume that your goal is instead</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.940" end="00:30:45.490" style="s2">is to maximize your productivity and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:46.659" style="s2">then you might say well that means that</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.490" end="00:30:48.309" style="s2">you have to take care of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.659" end="00:30:49.899" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re gonna burn out</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.309" end="00:30:52.139" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna get depressed you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.899" end="00:30:54.850" style="s2">get anxious you&#39;re gonna get exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.139" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">for which there&#39;s no diagnostic category</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.850" end="00:30:58.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s gonna interfere with your</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:01.010" style="s2">career so what you have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.780" end="00:31:06.200" style="s2">how can you maximize your productivity</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.010" end="00:31:07.760" style="s2">and often that means learning actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.200" end="00:31:09.560" style="s2">how much work you can do and how much</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.760" end="00:31:11.990" style="s2">leisure you need and how much you need</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.560" end="00:31:15.290" style="s2">to involve yourself in activities that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.990" end="00:31:17.560" style="s2">are outside of work and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.290" end="00:31:20.030" style="s2">things that happens to women</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.560" end="00:31:22.490" style="s2">particularly when they hit their 30s and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.030" end="00:31:23.540" style="s2">I&#39;ll speak primarily about the lawyers</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.490" end="00:31:25.400" style="s2">that I&#39;ve worked with because my blog</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.540" end="00:31:27.020" style="s2">worked with lots of female lawyers who&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.400" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">be made partners in large firms so</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.020" end="00:31:32.990" style="s2">they&#39;ve been very successful is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:38.060" style="s2">they hit 30 or so they&#39;re through their</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.990" end="00:31:40.520" style="s2">apprenticeship and they start to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.060" end="00:31:41.900" style="s2">very disillusioned with their job and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.520" end="00:31:43.460" style="s2">part of the reason for that is is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.900" end="00:31:44.780" style="s2">they make partner and then they find out</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.460" end="00:31:46.160" style="s2">that the partners that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.780" end="00:31:47.990" style="s2">associated with have all the foibles</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.160" end="00:31:50.360" style="s2">that are associated with normal people</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.990" end="00:31:52.970" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a bit of a decline in</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.360" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">idealism but they also find out that</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.970" end="00:31:58.370" style="s2">there actually is a lot more to life</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:01.040" style="s2">than working like a Mad Dog for 80 hours</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.370" end="00:32:03.830" style="s2">a week purely on legal issues which</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.040" end="00:32:05.380" style="s2">might not even be that interesting in</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.830" end="00:32:08.150" style="s2">and of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.380" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">so then they have to figure out well how</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.150" end="00:32:12.800" style="s2">much time should be taken off and most</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:16.430" style="s2">of the lawyers that I&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.800" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">have ended up working working fewer</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.430" end="00:32:20.300" style="s2">hours but billing more hours so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:22.610" style="s2">they got to have their take you needed</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.300" end="00:32:25.340" style="s2">to they take a day off a week or two</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.610" end="00:32:26.750" style="s2">days off a week they generally can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.340" end="00:32:28.700" style="s2">work shorter hours because that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.750" end="00:32:30.860" style="s2">how a profession like that works but</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.700" end="00:32:33.290" style="s2">they can plan to take time off in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.860" end="00:32:35.300" style="s2">future and do that quite regularly so</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.290" end="00:32:37.700" style="s2">maybe a two-week vacation every three</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.300" end="00:32:39.350" style="s2">months or every four months something</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.700" end="00:32:42.230" style="s2">like that or a week every four months</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.350" end="00:32:44.210" style="s2">and what they almost inevitably find is</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.230" end="00:32:48.050" style="s2">that the boost they get from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.210" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">vacation increases their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.050" end="00:32:52.310" style="s2">concentrate at work and makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:54.620" style="s2">valuable as a practicing partner and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.310" end="00:32:57.800" style="s2">you can think about it as a the attempt</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.620" end="00:33:00.260" style="s2">to reach an equilibration state the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.800" end="00:33:04.460" style="s2">question how much should you work is</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.260" end="00:33:06.800" style="s2">really the question how much can you</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.460" end="00:33:10.540" style="s2">work productively so that you can have</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.800" end="00:33:13.730" style="s2">the longest possible productive and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.540" end="00:33:15.320" style="s2">sustainable career and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.730" end="00:33:17.630" style="s2">you have to set up your career in such a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.320" end="00:33:19.790" style="s2">way that it doesn&#39;t eat so much of your</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.630" end="00:33:21.170" style="s2">life that you come to resent and hate it</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.790" end="00:33:23.300" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;ll bail out or</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.170" end="00:33:26.680" style="s2">you&#39;ll act in a counterproductive manner</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.300" end="00:33:29.030" style="s2">or you hurt yourself or so forth so I</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.680" end="00:33:31.190" style="s2">would say for young people the way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.030" end="00:33:32.750" style="s2">you figure that out is that you pick</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.190" end="00:33:35.780" style="s2">something difficult to do when you work</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.750" end="00:33:37.520" style="s2">yourself half to death doing it so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.780" end="00:33:39.470" style="s2">you can figure out where your actual</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.520" end="00:33:40.760" style="s2">limits are like your limits of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.470" end="00:33:43.850" style="s2">psychological and physiological</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.760" end="00:33:46.400" style="s2">endurance and once you exceeded your</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.850" end="00:33:49.370" style="s2">limits to pull back to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.400" end="00:33:50.930" style="s2">that becomes sustainable and then that</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.370" end="00:33:52.790" style="s2">way you&#39;re being hard on yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.930" end="00:33:56.980" style="s2">test yourself out but you&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.790" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">allowing yourself the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.980" end="00:34:01.130" style="s2">pursue what you&#39;re pursuing in the best</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.560" style="s2">of possible health and with the highest</p>

<p begin="00:34:08.030" end="00:34:14.780" style="s2">my views on euthanasia is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.220" end="00:34:16.760" style="s2">so many are against in a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.780" end="00:34:19.130" style="s2">individuals and societal aversion to</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.290" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">mean euthanasia is a complete nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.360" end="00:34:29.240" style="s2">I mean you know the slippery slope from</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.720" end="00:34:31.970" style="s2">it&#39;s okay if someone who&#39;s terminally</p>

<p begin="00:34:35.480" end="00:34:42.470" style="s2">is like that&#39;s uh that&#39;s a road that</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.700" end="00:34:50.990" style="s2">and so when you open up the specter of</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.750" end="00:34:53.330" style="s2">euthanasia you&#39;re also opening up</p>

<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:10.730" style="s2">think of euthanasia like torture so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.720" end="00:35:12.710" style="s2">can imagine the situation imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.730" end="00:35:15.380" style="s2">following situation and it&#39;s unrealistic</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.710" end="00:35:17.150" style="s2">because no real situation is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.380" end="00:35:19.940" style="s2">clearly bounded but we&#39;ll use it for the</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.220" end="00:35:54.980" style="s2">conduct that investigation and I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.920" end="00:35:56.930" style="s2">say and I know this is a flawed</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.220" end="00:36:08.260" style="s2">levels of threat as an interrogation</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:18.109" style="s2">because the use of torture say in a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.520" end="00:36:20.839" style="s2">situation about it&#39;s so absurdly</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.109" end="00:36:22.660" style="s2">socially dangerous that even if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.839" end="00:36:24.589" style="s2">could make a case that it was ethically</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.660" end="00:36:26.900" style="s2">justifiable in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.589" end="00:36:28.549" style="s2">circumstance you should pretty much be</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.900" end="00:36:30.440" style="s2">willing to give up the rest of your life</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.549" end="00:36:32.750" style="s2">as a consequence of having participated</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.440" end="00:36:37.190" style="s2">in that and I kind of think the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.750" end="00:36:39.049" style="s2">thing about euthanasia it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.190" end="00:36:41.319" style="s2">know what it Nietzsche said once that</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.049" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">nobody who&#39;s truly lived hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.319" end="00:36:48.710" style="s2">experienced the necessity of killing you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:50.599" style="s2">know when to put this in simple terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.710" end="00:36:54.849" style="s2">you know I had my dog put down in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.599" end="00:36:58.760" style="s2">February because he he was done and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.849" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">allowing him to expire naturally seemed</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.760" end="00:37:06.619" style="s2">to involve nothing but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:09.460" style="s2">unnecessary suffering so you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.619" end="00:37:14.270" style="s2">certainly imagine the situation where</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.460" end="00:37:15.829" style="s2">euthanasia seems like an the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.270" end="00:37:18.020" style="s2">option but that doesn&#39;t mean that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.829" end="00:37:22.549" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be absolutely surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.020" end="00:37:24.740" style="s2">high thickets of illegality I mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.549" end="00:37:26.450" style="s2">sometimes I think to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.740" end="00:37:31.029" style="s2">you&#39;re required to break a law and be</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.450" end="00:37:31.029" style="s2">punished for it now</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.090" end="00:37:37.120" style="s2">apart from that I&#39;ve also learned that</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.350" end="00:37:39.940" style="s2">commenting generally on questions like</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.120" end="00:37:41.350" style="s2">that is his almost always a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.940" end="00:37:46.560" style="s2">because the devil is always in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.350" end="00:37:49.540" style="s2">details so all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.560" end="00:37:50.950" style="s2">is there a way to find your true passion</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.540" end="00:37:54.190" style="s2">or is that just a cliche</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.950" end="00:37:56.200" style="s2">what&#39;s definitely its Lachey and it you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.190" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">know it&#39;s the sort of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.200" end="00:38:01.870" style="s2">actually annoys me quite a lot about New</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:06.810" style="s2">Age thinkers and I would more or less</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.870" end="00:38:06.810" style="s2">put Joseph Campbell in that category I</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.200" end="00:38:15.640" style="s2">think you can find what compels you and</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.190" end="00:38:17.590" style="s2">what might enable you to live in a high</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.640" end="00:38:19.300" style="s2">quality manner despite the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.590" end="00:38:21.010" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with life I think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.300" end="00:38:23.410" style="s2">can discover that and I think part of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.010" end="00:38:26.710" style="s2">the way you discover that is by watching</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.410" end="00:38:31.120" style="s2">yourself and learning when it is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.710" end="00:38:34.300" style="s2">you&#39;re meaningfully engaged you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.120" end="00:38:35.710" style="s2">notice that it&#39;s something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.300" end="00:38:38.770" style="s2">to you in some sense rather than</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.710" end="00:38:40.360" style="s2">something that you do you have to notice</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.770" end="00:38:43.540" style="s2">when you&#39;re meaningfully engaged and</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.360" end="00:38:45.430" style="s2">then you have to work to expand the</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.540" end="00:38:48.610" style="s2">amount of time that you spend in that</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.430" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">state but I would also say that there</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.610" end="00:38:51.910" style="s2">are moral requirements that go along</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:53.710" style="s2">with that too because you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.910" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">what if you happen to be the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.710" end="00:39:01.180" style="s2">person for example who finds torturing</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.560" end="00:39:03.370" style="s2">small animals meaningfully engaging it</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.180" end="00:39:04.870" style="s2">seems like that&#39;s a that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.370" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">meaningful engagement that you probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.870" end="00:39:09.730" style="s2">don&#39;t want to expand so I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:11.500" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to set up your life so</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.730" end="00:39:13.780" style="s2">that you maximize your meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.500" end="00:39:15.190" style="s2">engagement you have to there&#39;s a number</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.780" end="00:39:17.530" style="s2">of other things that you have to do at</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.190" end="00:39:21.250" style="s2">the same time and one of those is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.530" end="00:39:22.590" style="s2">you have to get very clear about who you</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.250" end="00:39:25.120" style="s2">are and what you&#39;re doing and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.590" end="00:39:27.400" style="s2">although this would be grounds for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.120" end="00:39:28.870" style="s2">much longer discussion I think that one</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.400" end="00:39:31.710" style="s2">of the things that you have to do if</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.870" end="00:39:33.970" style="s2">you&#39;re going to attempt to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.710" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">meaningful engagement is that you also</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.970" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">have to do such things as endeavor to</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:45.490" style="s2">stop deceiving yourself and other people</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:47.710" style="s2">in every way you possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.490" end="00:39:51.730" style="s2">and part of the reason for that is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.710" end="00:39:56.410" style="s2">if you engage in deception of any sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.730" end="00:39:58.480" style="s2">you pathologize the structure both first</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.410" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">the structure of your being but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.480" end="00:40:02.290" style="s2">could say you pathologies the structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:06.100" style="s2">of your nervous system and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.290" end="00:40:07.630" style="s2">can&#39;t trust its reports so if your nerve</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.100" end="00:40:09.430" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to rely on your nervous</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.630" end="00:40:11.830" style="s2">systems reports of meaningful engagement</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.430" end="00:40:13.900" style="s2">to guide your future activities you</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.830" end="00:40:15.100" style="s2">better do everything you can to make</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.900" end="00:40:17.260" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re not filling that</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.100" end="00:40:18.940" style="s2">nervous system with the kind of garbage</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.260" end="00:40:21.610" style="s2">that&#39;s going to make it malfunction and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.940" end="00:40:23.560" style="s2">give again give you false reports so I</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.610" end="00:40:26.490" style="s2">think that moving towards meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.560" end="00:40:29.530" style="s2">engagement has to be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.490" end="00:40:31.390" style="s2">making truth your highest value because</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.530" end="00:40:34.180" style="s2">otherwise you can&#39;t trust yourself as</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.390" end="00:40:35.800" style="s2">your own guide I mean the Catholics have</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.180" end="00:40:37.450" style="s2">struggled with this for a long time from</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.800" end="00:40:39.850" style="s2">a theological perspective because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.450" end="00:40:41.800" style="s2">Catholic position roughly speaking is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.850" end="00:40:43.619" style="s2">that human beings are so steeped in sin</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.800" end="00:40:45.850" style="s2">that they can&#39;t trust their own</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.619" end="00:40:48.280" style="s2">instincts in relationship to good and</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.850" end="00:40:52.180" style="s2">evil and have to use the church and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.280" end="00:40:54.550" style="s2">priesthood as an intermediary and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.180" end="00:40:56.740" style="s2">know you can obviously have an argument</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.550" end="00:40:58.420" style="s2">about that and of course Protestants</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.740" end="00:41:00.010" style="s2">have historically done that but you got</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.420" end="00:41:02.920" style="s2">to give the Catholics there dude it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.010" end="00:41:05.470" style="s2">like people aren&#39;t pure by nature and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.920" end="00:41:07.210" style="s2">only trammeled in their vision by you</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.470" end="00:41:09.430" style="s2">know sociological impediments they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.210" end="00:41:11.290" style="s2">also corrupt beyond belief individually</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.430" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">and have to use society as a source of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.290" end="00:41:19.240" style="s2">value so if you&#39;re going to personalize</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:21.310" style="s2">your life in some sense you better act</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.240" end="00:41:28.810" style="s2">in a manner that makes you a reliable</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.310" end="00:41:30.609" style="s2">guide so what time is it 2:30 well I</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.810" end="00:41:32.710" style="s2">think maybe we&#39;ll call that a day</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.609" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">because I&#39;m starting to get tired and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.710" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">I&#39;ll start giving answers that not only</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:40.780" style="s2">ramble but never actually come back to</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:43.150" style="s2">the question so let&#39;s call that a day</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.780" end="00:41:45.359" style="s2">and we&#39;ll take a look and see how it</p>
