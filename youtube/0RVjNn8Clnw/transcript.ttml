<p begin="00:00:02.449" end="00:00:11.010" style="s2">hi this is a feature video presentation</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.490" end="00:00:14.849" style="s2">in this series what is the Magellan</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.010" end="00:00:17.400" style="s2">course and in this video presentation we</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.849" end="00:00:20.570" style="s2">are going to look at the highest levels</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.400" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">of ego development as described from</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.570" end="00:00:28.800" style="s2">Suzanne Cook orators work now before we</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:31.679" style="s2">get into looking at these levels as she</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:35.870" style="s2">describes it I want to make a caveat and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.679" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">that is from a linear perspective</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.870" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">development suggests that the new forms</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:46.230" style="s2">will come from the people or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:48.950" style="s2">individuals that have achieved the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">highest forms but from an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.950" end="00:00:57.030" style="s2">spec perspective that is rarely the case</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:01:01.469" style="s2">from a evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.030" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">the highest or most mature forms of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.469" end="00:01:08.570" style="s2">current trajectory are usually dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">in that the new forms branch out from</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.570" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">earlier forms so as we look at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:17.820" style="s2">video of the highest forms that have</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">been described by developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.820" end="00:01:23.759" style="s2">the highest forms of cognitive and ego</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">development this is not to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.759" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">in the very individuals at the stage</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:35.400" style="s2">will be the individuals or the group of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">individuals that will carry on into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.400" end="00:01:42.030" style="s2">trajectory of the new form and again if</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.900" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">we look at the evolutionary record</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.030" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">that&#39;s rarely the case it&#39;s more often</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:50.430" style="s2">the case that the new trajectory toward</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:53.310" style="s2">the shift the evolutionary shift to a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.430" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">higher structure or a novel structure</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.310" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">comes from a branching some prior forms</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">so with that caveat being said I hope</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:12.690" style="s2">you enjoy this presentation of Suzanne</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:13.380" style="s2">Cooke graters description of the higher</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.690" end="00:02:15.750" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.380" end="00:02:33.900" style="s2">so the ego development as she can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.750" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">describe them so the first highest level</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.900" end="00:02:38.670" style="s2">the last two levels which she calls post</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">autonomous stages is called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.670" end="00:02:45.210" style="s2">construct aware stage and she writes at</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">the construct aware stage there is a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.210" end="00:02:52.680" style="s2">awareness of how language itself shapes</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">one&#39;s reality and for the first time the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.680" end="00:02:58.550" style="s2">boundaries the lines or boundaries one</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:03.500" style="s2">has drawn can be seen that they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.550" end="00:03:03.500" style="s2">arbitrary but useful distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.320" end="00:03:18.210" style="s2">opposites can be embraced because one</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.210" end="00:03:20.430" style="s2">realizes they necessitate each other so</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.210" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">this brings into the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.430" end="00:03:29.280" style="s2">identity of opposites she states the key</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:32.310" style="s2">to deeper understanding is to find the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.280" end="00:03:34.230" style="s2">ground that encompasses and unifies them</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.310" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">both and this is very significant</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.230" end="00:03:41.970" style="s2">because the word ground is intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:44.880" style="s2">chosen I think because instead of saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.970" end="00:03:46.980" style="s2">the key to understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.880" end="00:03:49.350" style="s2">relationship here between opposites is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.980" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">not to make the higher synthetic move</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.350" end="00:03:57.800" style="s2">but to find the deeper ground that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:03:57.800" style="s2">encompasses and has unified them both</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.040" end="00:04:03.959" style="s2">then at the next stage at the unitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.840" end="00:04:08.100" style="s2">stage one knows that opposites represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.959" end="00:04:12.240" style="s2">one underlying reality so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.100" end="00:04:14.610" style="s2">longer search it&#39;s just knowing that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.240" end="00:04:17.400" style="s2">struggle of opposites is a symptom of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.610" end="00:04:20.580" style="s2">our illusion that the boundaries we hold</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.400" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">are real thus the solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.580" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">struggle lies in the dissolving about</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">all boundaries even the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">between a map creating minds in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:35.400" style="s2">experience of reality and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:39.690" style="s2">this transparency that the maps that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.400" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">make to represent reality have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.690" end="00:04:47.580" style="s2">boundaries and also create a boundary</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:54.990" style="s2">between the map making activity in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.580" end="00:04:57.660" style="s2">experience of reality for the unitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.990" end="00:05:01.080" style="s2">person immediate experience with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.660" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">universe represents a freedom from the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.080" end="00:05:08.910" style="s2">tensions created by objectifying reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:12.360" style="s2">in framing it in dualistic terms so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.910" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">is a very profound statement that there</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.360" end="00:05:20.940" style="s2">can be for the unitive person an expedia</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:26.520" style="s2">experience with the universe that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.940" end="00:05:30.500" style="s2">free of the framing in objectified or</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.520" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">rarefied or abstract or conceptual terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.500" end="00:05:39.300" style="s2">free of the framing of that in dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:42.420" style="s2">terms and so for the Unity person the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.300" end="00:05:47.670" style="s2">unitive person understands that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.420" end="00:05:50.730" style="s2">they can see or into it or be aware of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.670" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">reality that is non-dualistic they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.730" end="00:05:59.340" style="s2">see that the dualistic aspect of reality</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">is constructed by the mind that frames</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.340" end="00:06:11.030" style="s2">that reality or represents that reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:13.170" style="s2">in dualistic terms so if we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.030" end="00:06:15.720" style="s2">movement or the operations from</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.170" end="00:06:18.090" style="s2">conventional to post conventional to</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.720" end="00:06:22.820" style="s2">post autonomous or the highest stages</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.090" end="00:06:26.760" style="s2">this is what Suzanne Kruger has to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.820" end="00:06:30.360" style="s2">in conventional development conventional</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.760" end="00:06:33.510" style="s2">development is the is constituted by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.360" end="00:06:37.140" style="s2">frame of mind that is most attached to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.510" end="00:06:40.650" style="s2">rationality or this rational structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.140" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">of consciousness intends to defend</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.650" end="00:06:45.900" style="s2">most against the intrusion of material</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:48.690" style="s2">from either non-national whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.900" end="00:06:51.690" style="s2">mythical or pre conventional sources or</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.690" end="00:06:54.389" style="s2">for more integrated later perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.690" end="00:06:58.710" style="s2">so the conventional mind the</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.389" end="00:07:01.500" style="s2">conventional or standard mind cent set</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.710" end="00:07:04.350" style="s2">of the rational structure what gaps are</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.500" end="00:07:08.699" style="s2">called the mental structure is defends</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.350" end="00:07:10.949" style="s2">itself against the suggestion that there</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.699" end="00:07:13.949" style="s2">are there are other ways of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.949" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">whether they&#39;re their pre conventional</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.949" end="00:07:22.289" style="s2">so mythical sources and influx or</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:23.910" style="s2">whether they&#39;re post conventional if the</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.289" end="00:07:27.539" style="s2">conventional mind accepts the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.910" end="00:07:29.550" style="s2">transpersonal personal at all it often</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.539" end="00:07:32.760" style="s2">does so as a belief system or an</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.550" end="00:07:35.370" style="s2">ideology and adheres to its letter and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.760" end="00:07:39.020" style="s2">mechanics rather than its spirits so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.370" end="00:07:42.509" style="s2">conventional mind can accept in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.020" end="00:07:44.190" style="s2">quotations the concept of transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.509" end="00:07:47.190" style="s2">and how it works</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.190" end="00:07:50.010" style="s2">how it can engineer problem-solving as</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.190" end="00:07:54.410" style="s2">received knowledge because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.010" end="00:07:58.970" style="s2">conventional mind can operate</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.410" end="00:08:03.720" style="s2">abstractions in a systematic sort of way</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.970" end="00:08:12.210" style="s2">without actually experiencing the</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.720" end="00:08:16.139" style="s2">transpersonal realm in the post</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.210" end="00:08:19.080" style="s2">conventional situation we see that the</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.099" end="00:08:32.789" style="s2">up up to the post conventional stage all</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.130" end="00:08:37.909" style="s2">the moves the eagle has made is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.789" end="00:08:41.180" style="s2">pattern of differentiation separation</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:08:59.490" style="s2">but once you get to the post</p>

<p begin="00:09:28.069" end="00:09:37.199" style="s2">autonomous view to see reality as well</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.540" end="00:09:40.889" style="s2">as the self as an interconnected whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.199" end="00:09:44.189" style="s2">or system rather than as an aggregate of</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.189" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">first step towards a more holistic view</p>
