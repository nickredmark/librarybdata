<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:14.099" style="s2">15 stories lined out including the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.480" end="00:00:17.279" style="s2">conclusion I realized there was one</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.099" end="00:00:19.109" style="s2">glaring omission and of course it was</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.279" end="00:00:23.910" style="s2">the one I omitted and that is my</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.109" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">addictions I am not like other addiction</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.910" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">stories because I&#39;m not sober I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:00:47.370" end="00:00:53.039" style="s2">oh and they&#39;re both used as</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.320" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">entertainment and they both are sources</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:59.850" style="s2">of thought and ideas and a way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">procrastinate from taking steps forward</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.850" end="00:01:08.280" style="s2">I have been with both of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">addictions for a very long time and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.280" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">have seen that the method I&#39;m using to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.200" end="00:01:16.340" style="s2">approach them is working because one the</p>

<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:27.750" style="s2">guilt I did it&#39;s still there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">still some that&#39;s why this video didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:43.470" style="s2">know my other my other stories I it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.960" end="00:01:47.100" style="s2">weird one in society I&#39;m both it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.470" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">one place I don&#39;t yet fully love and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.100" end="00:01:52.259" style="s2">accept myself I&#39;m getting there but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.780" style="s2">not there yet and it&#39;s one place that</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.259" end="00:01:57.119" style="s2">society definitely doesn&#39;t love and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.780" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">accept people in we accept some people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.119" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">addictions we accept addictions to money</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">and power we don&#39;t accept addictions to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">substances and even social media I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">not say for it&#39;s it&#39;s so commonplace</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">that we&#39;re okay with it but we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">definitely talk about it&#39;s a negative</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:18.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:20.580" style="s2">and it probably is I am living my life</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.120" end="00:02:22.560" style="s2">with authenticity so I&#39;ve been given the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.580" end="00:02:23.490" style="s2">guidance from my internal guides I still</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.560" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">had to figure out what better word for</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.490" end="00:02:27.140" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:29.850" style="s2">my intuition my subconscious whatever</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.140" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">the I wrote of these whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.850" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">messages come from that I either need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">give up my addictions or I just need to</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:40.950" style="s2">own them I need to be honest and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.540" end="00:02:43.740" style="s2">transparent about where they are</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.950" end="00:02:45.810" style="s2">constantly and that&#39;s kind of too many</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.740" end="00:02:47.430" style="s2">things to be transparent on every</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.810" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">bidding I&#39;m not gonna move I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.430" end="00:02:50.940" style="s2">update you on my health and my</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:52.860" style="s2">challenges and where my brains at and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.940" end="00:02:54.210" style="s2">where my addictions are at and what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.860" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">did good that day and when I did bad</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.210" end="00:03:00.300" style="s2">that day I&#39;m sure I will do that but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:04.410" style="s2">can&#39;t do all of that in every video but</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:06.900" style="s2">nor am i hiding it I smoke pot daily I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.410" end="00:03:10.410" style="s2">go through small periods of not smoking</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.900" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">it for a while when the need calls when</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.410" end="00:03:15.570" style="s2">I know there is when I feel the Colleen</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">when it&#39;s like yep time to give it up</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.570" end="00:03:22.470" style="s2">for a while until it&#39;s then time to use</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.640" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">it for a while pot and media have both</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.470" end="00:03:31.800" style="s2">been great fuel for my ideas and also</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:34.020" style="s2">hindrances to them and so my journey is</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.800" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">finding the balance neither of them do I</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.020" end="00:03:37.410" style="s2">want to give up completely I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:44.940" style="s2">to never watch TV shows and movies I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.410" end="00:03:47.610" style="s2">like them and I don&#39;t want to the irony</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.940" end="00:03:50.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it&#39;s ironic the beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.610" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">thing is that as I&#39;ve gone through this</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.070" end="00:03:56.250" style="s2">process this journey of learning to love</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:04:01.020" style="s2">and accept myself including where I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.250" end="00:04:05.610" style="s2">in my addictions they&#39;ve both loosened</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.020" end="00:04:07.739" style="s2">their grip on my life I am less addicted</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.610" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">to them than I was six months or a year</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.739" end="00:04:13.860" style="s2">ago or two years ago each time I go</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:15.120" style="s2">through a cycle of getting more down the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.860" end="00:04:17.520" style="s2">rabbit hole in the back out the rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:22.049" style="s2">hole each time has less and less grip on</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.520" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">my life and it would feel like I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.049" end="00:04:26.550" style="s2">doing it for society to cancel it out</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.550" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think abstinence for me is</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:36.960" style="s2">the answer it is to follow this journey</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:41.400" style="s2">and showcase it and be authentic in it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.960" end="00:04:43.889" style="s2">and I just wanted to honor that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.400" end="00:04:47.039" style="s2">addiction story is absolutely a part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.889" end="00:04:49.139" style="s2">my story in the past and ongoing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.039" end="00:04:50.759" style="s2">just like my health challenges just like</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.139" end="00:04:55.530" style="s2">a lot of what I have that I&#39;ve went</p>
