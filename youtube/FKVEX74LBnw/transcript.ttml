<p begin="00:00:12.150" end="00:00:15.179" style="s2">that they don&#39;t happen hoping that by</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:16.820" style="s2">virtue of saying and it&#39;s like a spell</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.179" end="00:00:20.250" style="s2">and then it doesn&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.820" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2"> well actually in our first</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.250" end="00:00:25.199" style="s2">conversation you said something that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">gave me the shivers he said like you</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.199" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">said like what happens if a million</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:34.050" style="s2">people are you know die and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:35.250" style="s2">watch that and what would the culture do</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.050" end="00:00:38.450" style="s2">he said something like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.250" end="00:00:41.760" style="s2">and that was like like a month before</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.450" end="00:00:44.129" style="s2">this whole business came down and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:46.050" style="s2">remember when you said that I you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.129" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">people say stuff and you don&#39;t you just</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.050" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">you just it just washes over you most of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:52.879" style="s2">the time but that kind of made me shiver</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:58.079" style="s2">a little bit I remember that moment</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.879" end="00:01:01.430" style="s2">to him I&#39;m releasing the the one heaven</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.079" end="00:01:07.470" style="s2">dialogue that three of us had tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.430" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">on my channel so cool cool great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.470" end="00:01:13.070" style="s2">well maybe we can we can delve in deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.790" end="00:01:18.450" style="s2">with the subject with the subjects that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve already started to discuss you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.450" end="00:01:22.409" style="s2">know we are talking about we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">started talking we talking about covet</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.409" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">and we&#39;ve already started talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">how this is a strange time a weird time</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:34.549" style="s2">a bizarre time and and and the time</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">actually time itself is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.549" end="00:01:41.880" style="s2">different during this period and which</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:43.439" style="s2">is the Greek word Kairos that was my</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.880" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">first question that I had for you guys</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.439" end="00:01:55.040" style="s2">is is if you could collaborate on this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">this Kairos this idea of critical moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.040" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">sure you might have I go for a second so</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">is what&#39;s important to that I put some</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:07.649" style="s2">fighting into that before all of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">when because in my series because I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.649" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">originally got the notion from Tillich</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:15.300" style="s2">and in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">he talks about it in quite a bit of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.300" end="00:02:20.520" style="s2">work and also connection you know it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.580" end="00:02:25.610" style="s2">took the courage to be and which he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.520" end="00:02:28.590" style="s2">dealing with the meeting crisis and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.610" end="00:02:32.580" style="s2">effect it&#39;s having on religion and his</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.590" end="00:02:34.380" style="s2">time and of course it&#39;s he gets it he</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.580" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">has the Christian slant on it because</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.380" end="00:02:40.740" style="s2">he&#39;s a Protestant theologian but and he</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:42.210" style="s2">claims that it was that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.740" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">really interesting sort of Christian</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.210" end="00:02:49.650" style="s2">spin on the Greek term one of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:51.980" style="s2">original metaphor is not metaphorical</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.650" end="00:02:56.070" style="s2">mythological in the good sense of myth</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.980" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">is the idea that of christ&#39;s advent came</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.070" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">in the fullness of time so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:05.300" style="s2">that systems will go along in place and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:08.070" style="s2">they have a lot of inertia to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.300" end="00:03:10.050" style="s2">they&#39;re very resistant to change and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.070" end="00:03:15.300" style="s2">then certain sets of conditions will</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.050" end="00:03:17.160" style="s2">console 8 such that an intervention will</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.300" end="00:03:19.800" style="s2">have a huge has a huge potential to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.160" end="00:03:22.920" style="s2">really steer the course of things so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.800" end="00:03:25.709" style="s2">idea about a Kairos is a fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.920" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">time in which timing matters because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.709" end="00:03:30.570" style="s2">can turn the way in which time unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:33.300" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s sort of many things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.570" end="00:03:36.170" style="s2">but that we&#39;re only in potentia have</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.300" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">come to a place where actualization and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.170" end="00:03:43.830" style="s2">transformation is possible and and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.800" end="00:03:45.690" style="s2">the way I try to take that mythological</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.830" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">notion that mythological existential</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.690" end="00:03:50.010" style="s2">notion because you you know you can note</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:50.970" style="s2">you can note that in your own life you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.010" end="00:03:52.800" style="s2">do not like when you&#39;ve been in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.970" end="00:03:54.630" style="s2">relationship with person and you can</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.800" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">come to a point where you feel that you</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.630" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">know the relationship has been stable</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">and then it hits this point right at</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.610" style="s2">hits this point and you go oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:06.930" style="s2">this you know people talk about maker</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.610" end="00:04:09.090" style="s2">breakpoints in in relationships and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.930" end="00:04:11.070" style="s2">you get a sense that oh this this could</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.090" end="00:04:13.230" style="s2">change the whole course of nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.070" end="00:04:15.060" style="s2">relationship so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.230" end="00:04:17.070" style="s2">mythological sense there&#39;s that personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.060" end="00:04:18.870" style="s2">phenomenological sense and then I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.070" end="00:04:21.510" style="s2">it I try to map it onto dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.870" end="00:04:23.370" style="s2">systems and the idea of criticality in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.510" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">self-organizing systems this comes from</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.370" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">per Bach</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:29.760" style="s2">systems are self-organizing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">quite stable and then they get to a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.760" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">point where the processes the very</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:36.720" style="s2">processes that made them stable actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:39.090" style="s2">start to undermine their structure the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.720" end="00:04:40.590" style="s2">classic example is the grain of you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.090" end="00:04:42.240" style="s2">the column of stand that&#39;s falling and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.590" end="00:04:44.460" style="s2">it builds a mound and the mound is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.240" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">stable for long periods and then when it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.460" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">gets too high because of its</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">self-organization it goes critical it</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:52.530" style="s2">avalanches its structure breaks down and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:55.080" style="s2">that criticality can either lead to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.530" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">disintegration of the system or it can</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.080" end="00:05:00.480" style="s2">afford a new base from which something</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:02.610" style="s2">new can emerge and be restructured and</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.480" end="00:05:05.040" style="s2">so in my mind I sort of put those three</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.610" end="00:05:06.570" style="s2">together when I think about Kairos and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.040" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">think we&#39;re getting increasing evidence</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.570" end="00:05:12.630" style="s2">that we&#39;re in something I mean I think a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:17.250" style="s2">lot of stuff is already chaotic and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.630" end="00:05:22.910" style="s2">I think the the the Cova crisis has just</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.250" end="00:05:22.910" style="s2">been an accelerant of of the Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:32.040" style="s2">Blair I yeah I mean I hold it similarly</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.920" end="00:05:34.350" style="s2">I first got it actually from off table</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.040" end="00:05:36.570" style="s2">Omar who was at Meridian University</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.350" end="00:05:39.200" style="s2">whose students of James Helens work and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.570" end="00:05:42.840" style="s2">then read it read Hillman writing about</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.200" end="00:05:45.270" style="s2">Kairos and relating it to this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.840" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">opportunity in particular and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.270" end="00:05:50.580" style="s2">kind of like penetrable opening within</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.430" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">the usually impenetrable fabric of fate</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.580" end="00:05:56.610" style="s2">or time that there&#39;s like a nick in time</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">like in the nick of time in the sense if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.610" end="00:06:03.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a chink in the armor of Chronos</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:06.750" style="s2">so that you can get in somehow and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.470" end="00:06:08.850" style="s2">so there&#39;s something about it too and</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.750" end="00:06:10.830" style="s2">relating it to the complex systems is</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.850" end="00:06:12.930" style="s2">something that I do instinctively in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.830" end="00:06:15.270" style="s2">in the realm of like individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.930" end="00:06:17.310" style="s2">development that if you look at critical</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.270" end="00:06:19.530" style="s2">periods in the development of any</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.310" end="00:06:21.150" style="s2">individual the critical period of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:23.730" style="s2">adolescent identity formation for</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.150" end="00:06:26.550" style="s2">example like most of adolescence feels</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.730" end="00:06:28.620" style="s2">chyron ik it feels so much pregnant</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.550" end="00:06:31.110" style="s2">opportunity so much can go right or</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.620" end="00:06:33.810" style="s2">wrong and so much is locking in even</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.110" end="00:06:36.630" style="s2">physiological the dysregulation and REE</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.810" end="00:06:38.120" style="s2">regulation of whole parts of identity</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.630" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">structure but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.120" end="00:06:43.580" style="s2">hormones and growth spurts and other</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:45.290" style="s2">things similarly in early childhood when</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.580" end="00:06:47.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got these critical the so called</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.290" end="00:06:49.760" style="s2">critical periods which are they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.720" end="00:06:51.350" style="s2">set in stone but you can feel them when</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.760" end="00:06:54.050" style="s2">they&#39;re happening as an educator or a</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.350" end="00:06:58.669" style="s2">parent and they&#39;re kind of written into</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.050" end="00:07:00.260" style="s2">the way the system develops and grows so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.669" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">similar then you have a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.260" end="00:07:06.830" style="s2">growing like embryologically for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:07.729" style="s2">or developmentally epigenetically within</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.830" end="00:07:11.750" style="s2">childhood</p>

<p begin="00:07:20.539" end="00:07:25.190" style="s2">dysregulation these things are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.160" end="00:07:27.289" style="s2">par for the course there because the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.190" end="00:07:31.970" style="s2">system&#39;s trying to get up and into some</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.289" end="00:07:33.949" style="s2">new form of patterning so crises are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.970" end="00:07:36.020" style="s2">usually moments of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.949" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">they&#39;re usually these moments of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.020" end="00:07:42.020" style="s2">and identity crisis in particular when</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:44.930" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking about the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.020" end="00:07:46.669" style="s2">the kind of phenomenology of Kairos in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.930" end="00:07:48.169" style="s2">your own life like what&#39;s it like what</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.669" end="00:07:50.510" style="s2">does it feel like you can remember those</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.169" end="00:07:53.870" style="s2">periods in your life when it just you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.510" end="00:07:55.970" style="s2">were in it and so the question of kind</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.970" end="00:08:00.950" style="s2">phylogeny to what extent we can apply</p>

<p begin="00:08:00.950" end="00:08:06.020" style="s2">civilizations we could say something</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.900" end="00:08:09.080" style="s2">like you know the civilization is in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.020" end="00:08:12.910" style="s2">kind of adolescent identity crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.080" end="00:08:15.650" style="s2">hmm neurotic import which is to say like</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.910" end="00:08:19.250" style="s2">this if we become a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.650" end="00:08:20.330" style="s2">civilization this kind of pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.250" end="00:08:23.570" style="s2">something we&#39;re gonna have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.330" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">deal with because of the nature of trade</p>

<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:31.789" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like this is what&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.570" end="00:08:34.669" style="s2">be a mature species that has planet eyes</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.789" end="00:08:37.370" style="s2">like grow up we need to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.669" end="00:08:39.020" style="s2">to deal with this and so that&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.370" end="00:08:41.630" style="s2">moment of opportunity where you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.020" end="00:08:44.330" style="s2">adolescent deals with reality or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.630" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">adolescent adapts to miss adapts to</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.330" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">reality and creates some identity</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:47.560" style="s2">structure and behavior patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:49.620" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.560" end="00:08:53.590" style="s2">adaptive and then you&#39;ve locked in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.620" end="00:08:56.140" style="s2">kind of a difficult way forward into</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.590" end="00:08:57.900" style="s2">full maturation if not an end up being</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.140" end="00:09:00.490" style="s2">self terminating identity construction</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:03.520" style="s2">mmm-hmm so that&#39;s one way I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.490" end="00:09:06.130" style="s2">model it I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.520" end="00:09:07.510" style="s2">think about it that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.130" end="00:09:09.490" style="s2">you know their limitations to it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.510" end="00:09:12.850" style="s2">there&#39;s something powerful to yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.490" end="00:09:16.720" style="s2">said that just you said that it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.850" end="00:09:20.140" style="s2">or either you go into a new higher level</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.720" end="00:09:22.180" style="s2">of realization or the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.140" end="00:09:24.040" style="s2">disintegrates and when I was saying that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.180" end="00:09:28.450" style="s2">I think both kind of happens</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.040" end="00:09:29.950" style="s2">simultaneously right it depends I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.450" end="00:09:32.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t that what sort of what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.950" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">now or what could be happening now or</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.400" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">well I mean it&#39;s may be that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">there&#39;s a degree of the criticality</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.100" end="00:09:45.570" style="s2">means the previous structure is</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">disintegrating literally to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.570" end="00:09:51.430" style="s2">so but there is there is a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.240" end="00:09:54.400" style="s2">tipping point right where if you go too</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.430" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">far the disintegration the entropy</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.400" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">overtakes the system and the system</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:10:03.130" style="s2">collapses right and and and and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:06.310" style="s2">might you might and and then it gets in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.130" end="00:10:07.420" style="s2">it can get stuck into a aberrant pattern</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.310" end="00:10:08.950" style="s2">which is kind of like I think with</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.420" end="00:10:11.830" style="s2">Jacques is talking about with the waking</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.950" end="00:10:15.220" style="s2">goal become maladaptive you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.830" end="00:10:17.560" style="s2">team you know who you know gets into</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.220" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">crime or something like that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.560" end="00:10:21.070" style="s2">like that but there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a I</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:24.310" style="s2">want to riff on with Jacques said</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.070" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">because so when you look at that those</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.310" end="00:10:28.690" style="s2">that self-organizing criticality you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:30.400" style="s2">actually see it in the brain you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.690" end="00:10:32.080" style="s2">actually see it at work in the insight</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.400" end="00:10:34.089" style="s2">like this is the work of stuff in in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.080" end="00:10:36.130" style="s2">Dixon in fact if when people are locked</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.089" end="00:10:37.450" style="s2">into a frame and this is why maybe</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.130" end="00:10:39.070" style="s2">bringing him framing might help because</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.450" end="00:10:40.360" style="s2">we could sort of link framing an</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.070" end="00:10:43.390" style="s2">identity that might give us even a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.360" end="00:10:45.160" style="s2">richer metaphor because they get locked</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.390" end="00:10:47.260" style="s2">into a particular frame and then what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.160" end="00:10:49.060" style="s2">you have to do is you actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.260" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">you have to throw a lot of noise you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.060" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">have to destabilize them you have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.040" style="s2">introduce entropy into the system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:57.160" style="s2">then that will actually provoke an</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.040" end="00:11:00.070" style="s2">insight and what&#39;s interesting is you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.160" end="00:11:00.970" style="s2">can see development I mean I think you</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.070" end="00:11:06.160" style="s2">did make a good argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.970" end="00:11:07.840" style="s2">if from interpreting Piaget because he</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.160" end="00:11:10.360" style="s2">sees the stages as bound to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.840" end="00:11:12.610" style="s2">systematicity of error you could see</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.360" end="00:11:14.740" style="s2">development when you move from one stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.610" end="00:11:17.560" style="s2">to another a systematic insight not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.740" end="00:11:21.100" style="s2">an insight here or here but a much more</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.560" end="00:11:24.130" style="s2">comprehensive set of insights like so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.100" end="00:11:26.290" style="s2">that your entire ways of looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.130" end="00:11:28.510" style="s2">world entire ways of being would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.290" end="00:11:30.430" style="s2">changing and that&#39;s where you could be</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.510" end="00:11:32.830" style="s2">even see the cognitive change and the a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.430" end="00:11:36.340" style="s2">change in identity are then start to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.830" end="00:11:42.580" style="s2">woven together and and why why that</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.340" end="00:11:45.910" style="s2">might be helpful to think about it is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.580" end="00:11:47.140" style="s2">sort of officially in terms of the text</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.910" end="00:11:49.630" style="s2">books we&#39;re not we&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.140" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">call them critical periods anymore was</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.630" end="00:11:54.040" style="s2">for because because the turn out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:55.210" style="s2">term had that you know the you know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.040" end="00:11:56.830" style="s2">you know if you&#39;re not exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.210" end="00:11:58.570" style="s2">language by the time you&#39;re 12</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.830" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">you&#39;ll never get syntax and it had that</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.570" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">sort of so the the terminology doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:08.590" style="s2">matter but it&#39;s felicitous here because</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:12.070" style="s2">we now call them sensitive periods and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.590" end="00:12:13.720" style="s2">so the idea here is just like the noise</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.070" end="00:12:15.910" style="s2">can sensitize the system and make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.720" end="00:12:18.220" style="s2">possible for it insight and if you look</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.910" end="00:12:20.170" style="s2">at complex systems you have sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.220" end="00:12:22.660" style="s2">dependence on initial conditions when</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.170" end="00:12:24.310" style="s2">you get into these Kairos States actions</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.660" end="00:12:27.190" style="s2">that normally that would have just been</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.310" end="00:12:30.070" style="s2">submerged into the system have like they</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.190" end="00:12:31.690" style="s2">have a tremendous capacity the sense to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.070" end="00:12:35.800" style="s2">change the future course of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.690" end="00:12:37.360" style="s2">system mmm and and so why I&#39;m bringing</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.800" end="00:12:38.920" style="s2">that up story this is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.360" end="00:12:41.650" style="s2">belated I&#39;m trying to get the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.920" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">and the the development of identity</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.650" end="00:12:47.230" style="s2">linked to this notion of a special kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:52.030" style="s2">of sensitivity because what that then</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.230" end="00:12:54.070" style="s2">brings in that is that there&#39;s a timing</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.030" end="00:12:56.410" style="s2">issue to this right there&#39;s a timing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.070" end="00:12:59.110" style="s2">issue to this that&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.410" end="00:13:01.930" style="s2">crucial so like an action that would it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.110" end="00:13:06.339" style="s2">have been impotent four weeks five weeks</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.930" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">ago yeah right now might make a big</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.339" end="00:13:11.830" style="s2">difference and it might also be impotent</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">on five weeks from now right we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.830" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">we&#39;re in a period where this</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:19.690" style="s2">system is sensitive to our actions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.750" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">if we can figure out a system ax tissa T</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.690" end="00:13:23.530" style="s2">in the air this is how I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:25.330" style="s2">bring it all together we can make an</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.530" end="00:13:26.740" style="s2">intervention that can permeate</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.330" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">promulgate throughout that entire</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.740" end="00:13:31.510" style="s2">systematicity so it seems like if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:33.790" style="s2">could just jump in that what we do right</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.510" end="00:13:35.530" style="s2">now is very important</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.790" end="00:13:37.090" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s what we do right now is very</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.530" end="00:13:38.860" style="s2">important but we have to couple that to</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.090" end="00:13:42.310" style="s2">a deep kind of discernment we have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.860" end="00:13:44.770" style="s2">try and track out like is it in all of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.310" end="00:13:47.740" style="s2">the chaos and all of the noise is there</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.770" end="00:13:49.420" style="s2">a systematicity of error signal we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.740" end="00:13:50.920" style="s2">getting error signals this went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.420" end="00:13:52.600" style="s2">this went wrong this went wrong this was</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.920" end="00:13:54.070" style="s2">wrong they give up the kid is trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.600" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">conservation errors they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.070" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">they&#39;re giving us all kinds of error</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:57.700" style="s2">signals and then something happens in</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:00.280" style="s2">their cognition where their brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.700" end="00:14:02.260" style="s2">figures out oh wait these errors are all</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.280" end="00:14:04.270" style="s2">related if I start doing this from now</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.260" end="00:14:06.970" style="s2">on I won&#39;t make any of these mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.270" end="00:14:09.250" style="s2">again we could do something analogous we</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.970" end="00:14:11.080" style="s2">have to bring in there has to be like we</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.250" end="00:14:13.030" style="s2">have to find that systematicity in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.080" end="00:14:15.160" style="s2">error we have to find where we could do</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.030" end="00:14:18.250" style="s2">so we can find like a nexus point right</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.160" end="00:14:20.440" style="s2">so we can we can we can find what&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.250" end="00:14:22.630" style="s2">sensitive to and where&#39;s the nexus point</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.440" end="00:14:26.590" style="s2">and where can our actions make the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.630" end="00:14:28.690" style="s2">impact right now so it&#39;s a timing it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.590" end="00:14:30.040" style="s2">timing it&#39;s a sensitivity issue it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.690" end="00:14:32.110" style="s2">issue but trying to find the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.040" end="00:14:34.210" style="s2">systematicity in the error I think the</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.110" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">people like we&#39;ve got a we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.210" end="00:14:39.160" style="s2">shift off of it&#39;s just chaos we&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.110" style="s2">shift - okay yes there&#39;s lots of noise</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.160" end="00:14:43.180" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of entropy let&#39;s try and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.110" end="00:14:46.780" style="s2">find because if there&#39;s no systematicity</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.180" end="00:14:49.180" style="s2">barrier we&#39;re screwed yeah there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.780" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">systematicity error our interventions</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.180" end="00:14:52.210" style="s2">won&#39;t make a systematic difference and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.390" style="s2">the system just gonna everything&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.210" end="00:14:57.160" style="s2">going to collapse right and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.390" end="00:14:58.600" style="s2">a timing issue it&#39;s the sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.160" end="00:15:01.270" style="s2">issue and most importantly it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.600" end="00:15:03.520" style="s2">discernment issue we&#39;ve got to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.270" end="00:15:06.490" style="s2">of work to try and figure out what do</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.520" end="00:15:07.210" style="s2">what what what what Gestalt what</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.490" end="00:15:09.130" style="s2">Consulate&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.210" end="00:15:12.280" style="s2">all these error signals so that we get</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.130" end="00:15:15.520" style="s2">some kind of unified sense of how we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.280" end="00:15:16.780" style="s2">make use of the carros that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.520" end="00:15:20.170" style="s2">trying to argue for mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.780" end="00:15:22.060" style="s2">so let&#39;s do that maybe I did I think it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.170" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">did um Zak</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.060" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">maybe Zak could riff on on this notion</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.010" style="s2">of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:30.200" style="s2">what how we can make use of this Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.010" end="00:15:35.570" style="s2">because that seems to be the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.200" end="00:15:37.790" style="s2">right is and you know what John speaking</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.570" end="00:15:38.780" style="s2">to is exactly correct from my</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.790" end="00:15:42.500" style="s2">perspective of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.780" end="00:15:45.590" style="s2">development and learning if you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.500" end="00:15:46.940" style="s2">class and during the entire class you</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.590" end="00:15:48.170" style="s2">get through you&#39;re never confused and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.940" end="00:15:49.760" style="s2">you&#39;re right like a perfect paper at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.170" end="00:15:52.520" style="s2">end you have not learned that myself</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.760" end="00:15:54.020" style="s2">right yeah well you i&#39;ve always tell my</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.520" end="00:15:56.630" style="s2">students like i want you to be very</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.020" end="00:15:58.790" style="s2">confused at certain points and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.630" end="00:16:00.200" style="s2">confusion is like a kind of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.790" end="00:16:01.460" style="s2">because you thought you understood and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.200" end="00:16:03.530" style="s2">now you&#39;ve encountered something and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.460" end="00:16:05.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t understand so you&#39;ve been what</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.530" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2">Piaget says disequilibrium right the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.900" end="00:16:10.790" style="s2">ability for you to just like run with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.540" end="00:16:15.770" style="s2">is it no longer viable you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.790" end="00:16:17.450" style="s2">somehow adjust your operating and so if</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.770" end="00:16:20.780" style="s2">you&#39;re in a situation you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.450" end="00:16:22.790" style="s2">develop or learn you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.780" end="00:16:26.080" style="s2">comfortable with being just equilibrate</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.790" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">aroan off and put in this chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.080" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">confusion and then as johnny ii was not</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.120" end="00:16:33.080" style="s2">saying within that you need to then</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:34.610" style="s2">start looking for the invariants because</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.080" end="00:16:36.740" style="s2">i&#39;m going you&#39;re hunting that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.610" end="00:16:40.700" style="s2">Piaget was always looking for the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.740" end="00:16:43.310" style="s2">abstraction of invariants from from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.700" end="00:16:45.110" style="s2">environment and first you discover the</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.310" end="00:16:47.840" style="s2">environment with your son the invariants</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.110" end="00:16:50.060" style="s2">with your sensory motor properties and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.840" end="00:16:52.310" style="s2">the affordances of the body and then</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.060" end="00:16:54.740" style="s2">slowly you extract the environs from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.310" end="00:16:56.540" style="s2">social and the physical into these</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.740" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">abstractions and then into principles</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.540" end="00:17:01.970" style="s2">and paradigms processes and some things</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:04.910" style="s2">so there&#39;s something here there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.970" end="00:17:08.620" style="s2">opportunity for the social system itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.910" end="00:17:12.949" style="s2">to move into a kind of higher order of</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.620" end="00:17:14.560" style="s2">abstraction and complexity being able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.949" end="00:17:16.850" style="s2">look at what&#39;s actually invariant</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.560" end="00:17:19.550" style="s2">because when the simulation is going</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.850" end="00:17:20.900" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite clear to tell what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.550" end="00:17:22.520" style="s2">and what&#39;s not real where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.900" end="00:17:24.740" style="s2">invariance like it&#39;s all working so when</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.520" end="00:17:26.810" style="s2">you&#39;re perfectly equilibrating your</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.740" end="00:17:28.069" style="s2">class and economics so it&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.810" end="00:17:30.650" style="s2">perfect sense there&#39;s a good opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.069" end="00:17:33.230" style="s2">that you&#39;re missing a huge part of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.650" end="00:17:34.580" style="s2">economics precisely because it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.230" end="00:17:35.900" style="s2">but there&#39;s something wrong there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.580" end="00:17:36.910" style="s2">something missing they&#39;re just working</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.900" end="00:17:38.590" style="s2">so well that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.910" end="00:17:40.750" style="s2">can tell something&#39;s wrong it&#39;s working</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.590" end="00:17:42.190" style="s2">so you can&#39;t tell something&#39;s wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.750" end="00:17:43.510" style="s2">so this is what&#39;s been happening with</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.190" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">the civilization for a long time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.510" end="00:17:47.920" style="s2">been working so well for the key members</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:49.840" style="s2">of the coalition yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.920" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">yeah yep enough error signal it can</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.840" end="00:17:54.940" style="s2">absorb it so exactly so it&#39;s absorbing</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:56.530" style="s2">there so you know and so now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.940" end="00:17:59.590" style="s2">this thing where I now we&#39;re getting a</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.530" end="00:18:00.940" style="s2">sense of all the possible error signals</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.590" end="00:18:02.050" style="s2">and now is John saying we can look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.940" end="00:18:04.060" style="s2">the system and today the error</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.050" end="00:18:05.500" style="s2">systematicity of the errors and detect</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.060" end="00:18:07.680" style="s2">the invariance and then that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.500" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">opportunity to move to a higher order of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.680" end="00:18:12.520" style="s2">abstraction spelled reflective</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:14.380" style="s2">abstraction in the pisciadood model and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.520" end="00:18:15.970" style="s2">then you have the grasp of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.380" end="00:18:18.460" style="s2">with the company is that so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.970" end="00:18:20.620" style="s2">inside which is we put it in front of</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.460" end="00:18:22.870" style="s2">you the subject becomes object as Keegan</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.620" end="00:18:25.210" style="s2">says and then the grasp of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.870" end="00:18:26.770" style="s2">comes in there&#39;s insight and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.210" end="00:18:28.810" style="s2">can consolidate at the higher level</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.770" end="00:18:30.640" style="s2">hopefully is that the other thing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.810" end="00:18:32.620" style="s2">can have the insight and then drop back</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.640" end="00:18:34.270" style="s2">down and this was a current Fisher&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.620" end="00:18:36.610" style="s2">great in stood like this movement of</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.270" end="00:18:38.890" style="s2">this zone of proximal development the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.610" end="00:18:41.080" style="s2">development to arrange is such that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.890" end="00:18:43.810" style="s2">can pop up and see it and then drop back</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.080" end="00:18:46.210" style="s2">down let me hop up and see it again drop</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.810" end="00:18:48.310" style="s2">back down so it&#39;s not just eating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.210" end="00:18:50.500" style="s2">inside it&#39;s also finding the ways to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.310" end="00:18:53.830" style="s2">the scaffolding in place to secure the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.500" end="00:18:57.970" style="s2">inside now kind of moving forward and</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.830" end="00:19:00.070" style="s2">that&#39;s the level consolidation and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.970" end="00:19:01.810" style="s2">then there&#39;s this notion of enduring in</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.070" end="00:19:03.160" style="s2">transitional structures as part of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.810" end="00:19:06.850" style="s2">developmental process that there are</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.850" end="00:19:10.210" style="s2">they&#39;re put in place temporarily to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.740" end="00:19:11.980" style="s2">to a structure that&#39;s actually an</p>

<p begin="00:19:11.980" end="00:19:17.620" style="s2">process like different kind of steps</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.430" end="00:19:20.410" style="s2">that you can use you can have parts of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.620" end="00:19:22.390" style="s2">the web as fisher described in that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.410" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">yesterday what structures are enduring</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.390" end="00:19:26.610" style="s2">and what structures are sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:29.260" style="s2">superficial and are just treads</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:31.540" style="s2">transition structures right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.260" end="00:19:33.250" style="s2">the deep question and development you</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.000" end="00:19:42.220" style="s2">motor operation those are partyer</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.820" end="00:19:44.260" style="s2">enduring cognitive structures but lower</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.220" end="00:19:46.600" style="s2">levels of moral development often you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.260" end="00:19:47.440" style="s2">kind of discard or at least you put them</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.600" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">in a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.440" end="00:19:54.250" style="s2">texts so yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">strands here but I pick up my general</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.250" end="00:19:57.970" style="s2">yeah please</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:19:59.830" style="s2">so one is to let&#39;s so what you just said</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.970" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">was very helpful because it helps me try</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.830" end="00:20:03.879" style="s2">to refine this discernment that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.690" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">trying to put up because part of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.879" end="00:20:09.730" style="s2">let&#39;s go back to the insight</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:11.830" style="s2">problem-solving and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.730" end="00:20:13.120" style="s2">you do to get people to afford insight</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.830" end="00:20:15.340" style="s2">as you call it you do the notice and</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.120" end="00:20:16.990" style="s2">variance heuristic you get people to pay</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.340" end="00:20:19.419" style="s2">attention and this is where why humility</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.990" end="00:20:21.309" style="s2">is really important but you get people</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.419" end="00:20:23.350" style="s2">to pay attention to failed problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.309" end="00:20:26.289" style="s2">formulations and then you try to notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.350" end="00:20:28.029" style="s2">what&#39;s invariant across those problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.289" end="00:20:29.620" style="s2">formulations and then you change that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.029" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly how you afford</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.620" end="00:20:34.029" style="s2">insight so this this brings up a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:37.570" style="s2">a question in my mind it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.029" end="00:20:38.889" style="s2">challenge to discernment which is how do</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.570" end="00:20:40.690" style="s2">you you have to you have to you know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.889" end="00:20:42.490" style="s2">have to notice the good in variants that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.690" end="00:20:44.169" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna track as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.490" end="00:20:45.549" style="s2">about exact but you also have to notice</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.169" end="00:20:48.490" style="s2">the bad in variants that you have to let</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.549" end="00:20:50.230" style="s2">go of but you have to abandon in order</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.490" end="00:20:52.179" style="s2">to get the insight that is needed for</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.230" end="00:20:54.580" style="s2">the transformation design there&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.179" end="00:20:56.289" style="s2">of part of the wisdom is what&#39;s the so</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.580" end="00:20:57.940" style="s2">you get the noise we turn it into</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.289" end="00:20:59.590" style="s2">systematicity as you said we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.940" end="00:21:01.570" style="s2">for the invariance but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.590" end="00:21:02.590" style="s2">even something more fine-grain we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.570" end="00:21:03.850" style="s2">to be able to discern the good</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.590" end="00:21:05.769" style="s2">invariance if you&#39;ll allow me these</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">normative terms from the bad invariance</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.769" end="00:21:11.049" style="s2">the bad invariants like that that might</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:13.059" style="s2">be you know analogous to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.049" end="00:21:14.919" style="s2">sets of constraints in the child schema</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.059" end="00:21:18.190" style="s2">you know that was actually holding them</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.919" end="00:21:19.659" style="s2">back and they have to be relaxed but as</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.190" end="00:21:21.669" style="s2">you said that doesn&#39;t mean you abandon</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.659" end="00:21:25.539" style="s2">all invariance because that&#39;s a disaster</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.669" end="00:21:26.830" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not just it&#39;s not sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.539" end="00:21:28.450" style="s2">not I&#39;m not trying to be critical or</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.830" end="00:21:31.120" style="s2">exact I&#39;m trying to build on it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.450" end="00:21:33.309" style="s2">just sort of finding the invariance it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.120" end="00:21:35.049" style="s2">also finding it&#39;s also distinguishing</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.309" end="00:21:37.330" style="s2">between the two kinds of invariants and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.049" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">getting the right trade-off between them</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.330" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">I think is part of what we&#39;re also what</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">I&#39;m also trying to get to with your help</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:48.970" style="s2">to this notion of discernment that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:51.129" style="s2">need to bring in did does that make</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.970" end="00:21:56.169" style="s2">sense it does makes perfect sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.129" end="00:21:59.049" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.169" end="00:22:00.440" style="s2">emotion and cognition er or completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.049" end="00:22:03.290" style="s2">inter digitated</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.440" end="00:22:05.180" style="s2">the Aegean model and so you get although</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.290" end="00:22:06.590" style="s2">those works mostly are not translated so</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.180" end="00:22:08.450" style="s2">he&#39;s conceived as a cognitive but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.590" end="00:22:09.920" style="s2">always says that feeling emotion and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.450" end="00:22:13.220" style="s2">cognition they&#39;re related and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.920" end="00:22:15.260" style="s2">a the the discernments not just</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.220" end="00:22:17.150" style="s2">cognitive cuz you&#39;re right there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.260" end="00:22:18.860" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of invariants that we</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.150" end="00:22:21.410" style="s2">don&#39;t own you know because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.860" end="00:22:24.740" style="s2">relevant right because it&#39;s not part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.410" end="00:22:28.610" style="s2">the of the field of what matters to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.740" end="00:22:30.410" style="s2">developing child and so this is where</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.610" end="00:22:32.500" style="s2">again I think also our identity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.410" end="00:22:35.000" style="s2">cognition are related as well because</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.500" end="00:22:38.800" style="s2">eventually what matters to me is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.000" end="00:22:42.740" style="s2">function of who I take myself to be and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.800" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">so in that sense this question of who</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.740" end="00:22:48.430" style="s2">one is and how one feels which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:55.310" style="s2">how one uses emotion as an information</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.430" end="00:22:57.380" style="s2">system those are kind of like more</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.310" end="00:22:59.510" style="s2">foundational than the cognitive moment</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.380" end="00:23:02.600" style="s2">not more foundational but there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.510" end="00:23:06.350" style="s2">deep interaction between these and you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.600" end="00:23:08.210" style="s2">can you cannot remove and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.350" end="00:23:11.960" style="s2">makes AI so dangerous right is that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.210" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">you&#39;re removing the affective and</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.960" end="00:23:18.530" style="s2">embodied vector of salience and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:21.050" style="s2">relevance let&#39;s say then your unmoored</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.530" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">from what actually matters and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.050" end="00:23:24.200" style="s2">that difference between the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:27.920" style="s2">and the reality that civilizations going</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.200" end="00:23:29.690" style="s2">to Sue&#39;s that if you&#39;re if the commodity</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.920" end="00:23:31.940" style="s2">disguises its relation to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.690" end="00:23:33.010" style="s2">biosphere so you don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.940" end="00:23:36.110" style="s2">actually this thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.010" end="00:23:38.060" style="s2">it&#39;s the disembodied idea but the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.110" end="00:23:40.340" style="s2">actual body is quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.060" end="00:23:42.350" style="s2">completely unsustainable couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.340" end="00:23:43.880" style="s2">extracted at that rate for another two</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.350" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">years five years you know depending on</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.880" end="00:23:49.280" style="s2">what the commodity is and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:54.250" style="s2">this way that though the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.280" end="00:23:57.110" style="s2">apparatus needs to be within the the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.250" end="00:23:59.840" style="s2">affective and the evaluative and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.110" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">in baggage container when that helps get</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.840" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">the sense of which invariants am i</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:07.940" style="s2">detecting right I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:10.820" style="s2">I mean fact I think that&#39;s fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.940" end="00:24:12.650" style="s2">to relevance realization Montagu</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.820" end="00:24:14.090" style="s2">actually talked about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.650" end="00:24:17.060" style="s2">difference between us and computer</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.090" end="00:24:18.740" style="s2">to use your your point azar is that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.060" end="00:24:19.850" style="s2">have to take care of ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.740" end="00:24:22.220" style="s2">therefore we have to care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.850" end="00:24:24.710" style="s2">information and so I&#39;m using care here</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.220" end="00:24:26.420" style="s2">in a high-tech gear sense that what</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.710" end="00:24:28.580" style="s2">we&#39;re talkin relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.420" end="00:24:30.560" style="s2">ultimately and I think this will get us</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.580" end="00:24:32.930" style="s2">back to the affective stuff even the</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.560" end="00:24:33.740" style="s2">existential stuff the you know like</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.930" end="00:24:36.110" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.740" end="00:24:37.820" style="s2">identity because relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.110" end="00:24:39.950" style="s2">is also ultimately processed by which</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.820" end="00:24:41.720" style="s2">you&#39;re committing it&#39;s it&#39;s it is acts</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.950" end="00:24:43.610" style="s2">of commitment and they could be micro</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.720" end="00:24:46.160" style="s2">acts of committing no seconds of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.610" end="00:24:47.810" style="s2">attention seconds of arousal but it can</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.160" end="00:24:50.030" style="s2">also be macro acts where you can you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.810" end="00:24:52.760" style="s2">committing long periods of your very</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.760" end="00:24:57.890" style="s2">resources time either so I I I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.180" end="00:24:59.210" style="s2">that ultimately and this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.890" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do the AI think but this</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.210" end="00:25:03.110" style="s2">is one of the things holding back AI</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:05.000" style="s2">right now because because ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.110" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">relevance realization is never cold</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.000" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">calculation it&#39;s never cold calculation</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:11.890" style="s2">it&#39;s always an act of commitment and now</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:14.210" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna sound like Heidegger and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.890" end="00:25:16.130" style="s2">commitment is always an act of caring</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.210" end="00:25:19.460" style="s2">and commitment and caring are always</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.130" end="00:25:21.380" style="s2">identity forming processes that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.460" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">the way I mean the best way to find out</p>

<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:27.230" style="s2">romantic introspective act it&#39;s to pay</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:39.470" style="s2">to what what can you reliably hold me to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.010" end="00:25:41.180" style="s2">committing to well Donald Jonathan will</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.470" end="00:25:45.470" style="s2">commit to this well that&#39;s the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:25:45.470" end="00:25:53.480" style="s2">that if we could if we could agree that</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.600" end="00:25:56.870" style="s2">you know this process we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.480" end="00:25:59.390" style="s2">about is deeply one of caring and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.870" end="00:26:00.980" style="s2">commitment and cognition and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.390" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">that overlaps with your terms of effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.980" end="00:26:07.880" style="s2">and identity really deeply then is it</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:12.710" style="s2">possible and and I like your point that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.880" end="00:26:16.040" style="s2">it&#39;s only that fully embodied process</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.710" end="00:26:17.570" style="s2">that can get the discernment or at least</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.040" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">get good discernment between the bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.570" end="00:26:22.450" style="s2">environments and the good invariants</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.980" end="00:26:25.460" style="s2">what&#39;s the analog for the culture right</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.450" end="00:26:27.270" style="s2">because I think you&#39;re right if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.460" end="00:26:29.340" style="s2">taking a look at an individual cognition</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.270" end="00:26:31.440" style="s2">we can you know there&#39;s relevance</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.340" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">realization it&#39;s never cold calculation</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.440" end="00:26:36.210" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s about trying to zero</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:37.950" style="s2">in on what I should care about what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.210" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">should commit to what I there by</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.950" end="00:26:44.040" style="s2">identify with right and that that whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:45.990" style="s2">process is you know and insight is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.040" end="00:26:47.580" style="s2">moments where that&#39;s restructuring and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.990" end="00:26:49.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s what actually is helping me</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.580" end="00:26:51.690" style="s2">pull apart the grid and variance from</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:54.660" style="s2">the batted variance within times of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.690" end="00:26:55.890" style="s2">development times of Kairos so Zack this</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.660" end="00:26:58.340" style="s2">is a hard question but I&#39;m loving it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.890" end="00:27:01.530" style="s2">over to you what&#39;s the analog to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.340" end="00:27:04.710" style="s2">distributed cognition and collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.530" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">intelligence right it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.710" end="00:27:08.670" style="s2">the first thing that came to mind was</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:16.590" style="s2">that something like a properly</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.670" end="00:27:21.720" style="s2">functioning religion yeah try my best</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.590" end="00:27:23.700" style="s2">not to buy away so I throw in one one</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.720" end="00:27:26.250" style="s2">word here that I got from Nora Bateson</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.700" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">which came to mind you&#39;re talking he</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.250" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">talked about warm data versus cold data</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.190" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">is that what you&#39;re talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.540" end="00:27:40.890" style="s2">warm data would be data that&#39;s embodied</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:42.840" style="s2">and well I mean III got to talk to Nora</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.890" end="00:27:45.150" style="s2">directly about this and there&#39;s a video</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.840" end="00:27:48.110" style="s2">on my channel about that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.150" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">actually with 1010 Adaline and I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.110" end="00:27:55.920" style="s2">any Nora means she means she&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.750" style="s2">dismissing the effect but she&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.920" end="00:27:59.670" style="s2">to point out that we&#39;re all always if</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.750" end="00:28:01.950" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me this ethnographically</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.670" end="00:28:03.780" style="s2">immersed and in the problems that really</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.950" end="00:28:06.660" style="s2">matter to us they&#39;re not just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.780" end="00:28:08.280" style="s2">problems out there there&#39;s there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.660" end="00:28:10.050" style="s2">are a complexity they&#39;re a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.280" end="00:28:13.050" style="s2">and their interactions between them is</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.050" end="00:28:15.450" style="s2">complex and so we the warm data is data</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.050" end="00:28:18.180" style="s2">that is much more contextually sensitive</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.450" end="00:28:21.570" style="s2">and comprehensive and more much more</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.180" end="00:28:24.090" style="s2">dynamically sensitive and responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.570" end="00:28:26.370" style="s2">that reality that&#39;s how I understood</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.090" end="00:28:28.560" style="s2">what she meant by warm data I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.370" end="00:28:30.840" style="s2">think the effect part is being excluded</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.560" end="00:28:32.040" style="s2">but I think I don&#39;t want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.840" end="00:28:33.300" style="s2">that&#39;s what she&#39;s primarily put her in</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.040" end="00:28:36.030" style="s2">your finger I think she&#39;s trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.300" end="00:28:38.610" style="s2">a finger on yeah well no no there you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.030" end="00:28:40.830" style="s2">know there&#39;s the kind of data that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.610" end="00:28:41.100" style="s2">are gathering when we&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.830" end="00:28:43.530" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.100" end="00:28:46.289" style="s2">important decisions the decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.530" end="00:28:48.539" style="s2">involve commitment existential</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.289" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">commitment and transformation are warm</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.539" end="00:28:53.250" style="s2">data decisions they&#39;re never data we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:56.970" style="s2">never get data that is coldly dis</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.250" end="00:28:58.980" style="s2">identified coldly abstracted and coldly</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.970" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">separate from us when we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.980" end="00:29:02.520" style="s2">wrestle on really important decisions</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:06.630" style="s2">time that&#39;s how I understood her to mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.520" end="00:29:09.710" style="s2">that okay well sorry Mike Chris John&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.630" end="00:29:12.870" style="s2">question I just threw that one but but</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.710" end="00:29:14.669" style="s2">three seconds but I think that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.870" end="00:29:16.530" style="s2">one data is exactly the kind of data</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.669" end="00:29:18.330" style="s2">processing if you&#39;ll allow me to stretch</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.530" end="00:29:19.799" style="s2">your metaphor that goes on in religion</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.330" end="00:29:22.020" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s irrelevant what</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.799" end="00:29:24.210" style="s2">you said Andrew I don&#39;t think it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.020" end="00:29:26.820" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.210" end="00:29:29.159" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m out that&#39;s what times you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.820" end="00:29:31.380" style="s2">Nagle&#39;s with the view from nowhere right</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.159" end="00:29:34.110" style="s2">like this is the idea that actually no</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.380" end="00:29:38.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not science its scientists there</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.110" end="00:29:41.190" style="s2">everyone has a body and has a family and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.159" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">mother who brought him forth screaming</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.190" end="00:29:45.990" style="s2">and the dinner they go to the bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:49.500" style="s2">and so the idea that the scientist is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.990" end="00:29:51.240" style="s2">primary that the science follows from</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.500" end="00:29:53.280" style="s2">the scientists and you can take that too</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.240" end="00:29:55.730" style="s2">far into the postmodern critique we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.280" end="00:29:58.710" style="s2">all science becomes power and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.730" end="00:30:01.950" style="s2">psychoanalyze away truth and to Bob you</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.710" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">know biography but there is something</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.950" end="00:30:06.780" style="s2">really profound about this reorientation</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.270" style="s2">which has happened I think since the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.780" end="00:30:10.500" style="s2">maybe the 90s it&#39;s never been completed</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.270" end="00:30:11.940" style="s2">that&#39;s not well distributed but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.500" end="00:30:15.659" style="s2">been an awareness of a lot of scholars</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.940" end="00:30:18.330" style="s2">that actually we need to take the human</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.659" end="00:30:21.150" style="s2">element within the knowing system very</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.330" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">seriously and that reduces us down not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.150" end="00:30:27.030" style="s2">reduces us but it it shifts the figure</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:28.730" style="s2">in ground so that we become aware we</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.030" end="00:30:32.309" style="s2">become more aware of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.730" end="00:30:34.620" style="s2">emotional identity positions that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.309" end="00:30:36.030" style="s2">in as researchers and and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.620" end="00:30:39.690" style="s2">intellectuals and things of that nature</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.030" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">and yeah and so in that sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.690" end="00:30:46.930" style="s2">similar to admitting that there are</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:49.450" style="s2">religious aspects to even sign</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.930" end="00:30:51.730" style="s2">right that we are investigating truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.450" end="00:30:54.220" style="s2">together and that if we do it in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.730" end="00:30:56.710" style="s2">earnest enough manner know that we would</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.220" end="00:31:00.070" style="s2">end up finding things that we would kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.710" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">of live by and that would allow us as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.070" end="00:31:04.060" style="s2">group to then do the kind of concern to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:05.560" style="s2">sermon you&#39;re talking about John like at</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.060" end="00:31:09.400" style="s2">the cultural level there have to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.560" end="00:31:13.420" style="s2">these shared frameworks of value and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.400" end="00:31:18.430" style="s2">identity and for shared frameworks of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.420" end="00:31:21.250" style="s2">reality and so that&#39;s interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.430" end="00:31:23.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve you know that cuts both ways right</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.250" end="00:31:26.110" style="s2">we know the bad stories of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.020" end="00:31:29.860" style="s2">we know my why modernity decided to try</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.110" end="00:31:32.770" style="s2">a different way of organizing people and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.860" end="00:31:36.010" style="s2">it was important human evasion variance</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.770" end="00:31:38.530" style="s2">right right Zak right like the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.010" end="00:31:40.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not like you&#39;re not yeah when you</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.530" end="00:31:41.830" style="s2">brought up you brought up the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:42.820" style="s2">and say well what&#39;s that is for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.830" end="00:31:46.660" style="s2">collective intelligence is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.820" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">well-functioning religion right then and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.660" end="00:31:51.190" style="s2">I want to really get to your previous</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:53.910" style="s2">point I mean there&#39;s there&#39;s stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.190" end="00:31:55.780" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t unlearned the fact that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.910" end="00:31:57.970" style="s2">practically if I can put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.780" end="00:31:59.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not proposing religion in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.970" end="00:32:01.750" style="s2">nostalgic fashion</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.470" end="00:32:03.430" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying I want to give up this</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.750" end="00:32:05.140" style="s2">is what I need this is you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.430" end="00:32:07.450" style="s2">right now you&#39;re trying to pull a part</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.140" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">right the the invariance that we should</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.450" end="00:32:12.430" style="s2">hang on to from religion if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:14.020" style="s2">me this language and discern which are</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.430" end="00:32:16.480" style="s2">the what are the bad invariants that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.020" end="00:32:18.250" style="s2">need to notice and let go of so we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.480" end="00:32:20.260" style="s2">break through to a new developmental</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.250" end="00:32:22.210" style="s2">stage I think you&#39;re you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.260" end="00:32:25.090" style="s2">concretely exactly what I was asking for</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.210" end="00:32:27.310" style="s2">yeah and this is the idea it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.090" end="00:32:30.310" style="s2">decentering and ph8 in terms and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.310" end="00:32:34.930" style="s2">you&#39;re revealing you&#39;re moving out from</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.310" end="00:32:36.790" style="s2">the surface to the depth and yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.930" end="00:32:39.190" style="s2">very interesting the notion of what are</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.790" end="00:32:42.390" style="s2">the enduring structures that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.190" end="00:32:44.590" style="s2">preserve within the traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.390" end="00:32:46.120" style="s2">what&#39;s the form that the enduring</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.590" end="00:32:49.090" style="s2">structures take is they&#39;re integrated</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.120" end="00:32:50.950" style="s2">into new life structures emergent</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.090" end="00:32:52.630" style="s2">structures and so the moment now the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.950" end="00:32:54.010" style="s2">chaotic moment is one where all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.630" end="00:32:55.690" style="s2">structures are kind of coming undone</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.010" end="00:32:57.640" style="s2">which means we can gather the bests</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.690" end="00:32:58.030" style="s2">enduring structures together and move</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.640" end="00:33:02.380" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.030" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.380" end="00:33:09.070" style="s2">frame I like because this helps to make</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:11.890" style="s2">beautiful to use a phrase from Plato 7th</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.070" end="00:33:13.750" style="s2">letter the idea I was always rendering</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.890" end="00:33:16.060" style="s2">very in a very ugly fashion I was trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.750" end="00:33:20.110" style="s2">to talk about salvaging from these</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.060" end="00:33:22.300" style="s2">traditions you know he tries to find</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.110" end="00:33:24.550" style="s2">what was what&#39;s still good within which</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.300" end="00:33:26.560" style="s2">which has been described but I like what</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.550" end="00:33:28.690" style="s2">how we&#39;re talking about it now I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.560" end="00:33:33.310" style="s2">it&#39;s much more refined and and much more</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.690" end="00:33:34.990" style="s2">interesting so I guess so that has</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.310" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">something to do with the living beauty</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.990" end="00:33:38.860" style="s2">you mentioned beauty right the living</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:46.150" style="s2">beauty yeah I think what&#39;s what&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.860" end="00:33:49.690" style="s2">rather than whatever is dog we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.150" end="00:33:51.700" style="s2">superficial or or dangerous or that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.690" end="00:33:54.490" style="s2">excellent that&#39;s an excellent way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.700" end="00:33:57.070" style="s2">an excellent segue I do because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.490" end="00:33:59.710" style="s2">so if you&#39;ll allow me to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.070" end="00:34:00.670" style="s2">bit you know UDL the aesthetics of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.710" end="00:34:02.110" style="s2">are very important because the</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.670" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">aesthetics is precisely where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.110" end="00:34:06.730" style="s2">bridging you know between a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:07.900" style="s2">things what we Karen thing about it when</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.730" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">you when you&#39;re experiencing beauty this</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.900" end="00:34:10.600" style="s2">is the great photonic insight you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:13.270" style="s2">you&#39;re having one of your most profound</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.600" end="00:34:16.149" style="s2">cognitive insight but you&#39;re also having</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.270" end="00:34:18.310" style="s2">an education in the Platonic sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.149" end="00:34:20.500" style="s2">aware of your sensibility and what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.310" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">care about right this is why Plato</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.500" end="00:34:25.480" style="s2">linked the understanding of beauty to</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:27.370" style="s2">the cultivation of virtue and so think</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.480" end="00:34:30.070" style="s2">about Ron&#39;s work on saving beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.370" end="00:34:31.929" style="s2">think about the aesthetics so he he</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.070" end="00:34:34.270" style="s2">talks about and you see how this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.929" end="00:34:36.040" style="s2">pressing to a lot of ways before all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.270" end="00:34:38.379" style="s2">this hit we were in what he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.040" end="00:34:40.960" style="s2">aesthetics of the smooth we like things</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.379" end="00:34:43.149" style="s2">that are smooth and you know like</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.960" end="00:34:46.540" style="s2">objects that are smooth and and we like</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.149" end="00:34:48.820" style="s2">data production and communication we</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.540" end="00:34:51.730" style="s2">want everything to run smoothly and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.820" end="00:34:55.720" style="s2">want everybody&#39;s face and the smooth is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.730" end="00:34:57.460" style="s2">a is an aesthetic that is the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.720" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">tyranny of the projection of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.460" end="00:35:03.430" style="s2">subjective right the world is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:06.430" style="s2">to be completely conducive to me and in</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.430" end="00:35:08.380" style="s2">no way rupture or challenge me and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.430" end="00:35:10.330" style="s2">he what he actually says and I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.380" end="00:35:11.380" style="s2">he&#39;s right as he says we&#39;ve really that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.330" end="00:35:13.779" style="s2">really has law</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.380" end="00:35:16.029" style="s2">aesthetic is really lost beauty that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.779" end="00:35:19.240" style="s2">simulacrum of beauty rather than beauty</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.029" end="00:35:22.180" style="s2">itself yeah which has always has edges</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.240" end="00:35:24.190" style="s2">to it and and always is as depth and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.180" end="00:35:26.589" style="s2">even is a little slightly painful and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.190" end="00:35:28.119" style="s2">and well it should be performing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.589" end="00:35:33.579" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.119" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">brocade describes the angel beauty is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.579" end="00:35:37.059" style="s2">terror that were basically barely able</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:40.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.059" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">um I think relevant right now because</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.630" end="00:35:45.549" style="s2">you know beauty is something that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:47.140" style="s2">mean it should strike you that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.549" end="00:35:50.380" style="s2">verb that Plato uses repeatedly you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.140" end="00:35:54.730" style="s2">struck by it it&#39;s and and the Greek is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.380" end="00:35:57.369" style="s2">fairly violent striking right and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.730" end="00:36:00.250" style="s2">the point about the lover and also the</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.369" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">fall-off Ilia Sophia the lover of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.250" end="00:36:10.390" style="s2">is the they have they have a capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:12.759" style="s2">do well these affairs any in terms they</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.390" end="00:36:16.329" style="s2">can find they can they can right</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.759" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">accommodate to the beauty and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.329" end="00:36:20.440" style="s2">and they&#39;re not distinguished from each</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:22.809" style="s2">other right the ability to accommodate</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.440" end="00:36:24.849" style="s2">the beauty is precisely what makes it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.809" end="00:36:27.069" style="s2">beautiful if you can if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.849" end="00:36:30.039" style="s2">accommodate you don&#39;t have you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.069" end="00:36:32.859" style="s2">have ah you have terror right mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.039" end="00:36:36.609" style="s2">so this this allows me to prim another</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.859" end="00:36:39.069" style="s2">question right so think about the deep</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.609" end="00:36:42.660" style="s2">interconnection of the education of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.069" end="00:36:45.910" style="s2">sensibility and aesthetics within a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.660" end="00:36:47.680" style="s2">religious community that&#39;s functioning</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.910" end="00:36:48.849" style="s2">well here&#39;s how I think of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.680" end="00:36:51.039" style="s2">they&#39;re one of my friend and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.849" end="00:36:53.799" style="s2">Jonathan Peres show where he goes back</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.039" end="00:36:55.990" style="s2">and he tries to re-educate people right</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.799" end="00:36:57.819" style="s2">into what all this symbolism was doing</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.990" end="00:36:59.670" style="s2">you know aesthetically in this deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.819" end="00:37:04.269" style="s2">sense that I&#39;m talking about seeing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.670" end="00:37:06.750" style="s2">seeing the the aesthetics of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.269" end="00:37:08.859" style="s2">experience as a fundamental thing sweep</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.750" end="00:37:10.930" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll put it in a put it in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.859" end="00:37:12.329" style="s2">sentence and I&#39;ll turn it to Zack as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.930" end="00:37:16.119" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.329" end="00:37:17.859" style="s2">right I think you know children go</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.119" end="00:37:19.180" style="s2">through this the little with serious</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.859" end="00:37:20.470" style="s2">play I&#39;ve made that argument before you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.180" end="00:37:20.950" style="s2">guys are familiar with it we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.470" end="00:37:24.549" style="s2">it up again</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.950" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">but right I think and coupled</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.549" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">has to be an education that removes</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:34.599" style="s2">aesthetics out of entertainment and puts</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:38.170" style="s2">it back into education and and because</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.599" end="00:37:40.719" style="s2">that&#39;s part that&#39;s a part of is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.170" end="00:37:42.939" style="s2">religious vision that Zak I think is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.719" end="00:37:45.160" style="s2">alluding to that we have lost the threat</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.939" end="00:37:49.329" style="s2">of we&#39;ve lost the threat of in a</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:56.289" style="s2">powerful way and so my question to zach</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.329" end="00:37:58.299" style="s2">is that right do you think that so this</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.289" end="00:38:00.099" style="s2">is kind of self-deprecating for all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.299" end="00:38:02.589" style="s2">us as well do you think that the answer</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.099" end="00:38:04.029" style="s2">that we&#39;re looking for and I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.589" end="00:38:07.209" style="s2">that as a simple answer you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.029" end="00:38:11.709" style="s2">mean a comprehensive trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.209" end="00:38:14.979" style="s2">response is going to come out more from</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.709" end="00:38:16.779" style="s2">an artistic set of people people that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.979" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">are at home with the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.779" end="00:38:24.630" style="s2">aspects of beauty then us intellectuals</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.439" end="00:38:29.380" style="s2">so I&#39;m getting a lot of emails from</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.699" end="00:38:32.949" style="s2">artists now that I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.380" end="00:38:34.869" style="s2">before a lot a lot more and their dirt</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.949" end="00:38:37.839" style="s2">they seem to be the people that rush</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.869" end="00:38:39.309" style="s2">into the Kairos better than anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.839" end="00:38:41.799" style="s2">because they one of the ways they</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.309" end="00:38:44.650" style="s2">systematize the error is if you&#39;ll allow</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.799" end="00:38:46.209" style="s2">me a verb a they beautify it which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.650" end="00:38:48.130" style="s2">the same thing as resolving it and are</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.209" end="00:38:50.019" style="s2">solving it in the intellectual fashion</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.130" end="00:38:55.329" style="s2">but they beautify it so that people can</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.019" end="00:38:56.439" style="s2">accommodate it and move into it I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.329" end="00:38:58.390" style="s2">think what the answers gotta be of</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.439" end="00:39:01.179" style="s2">course of course it&#39;s gonna come from</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.390" end="00:39:04.059" style="s2">the artists you know I think Plato said</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.179" end="00:39:07.029" style="s2">though that often the artist doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.059" end="00:39:08.109" style="s2">know exactly what they&#39;re saying on but</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.029" end="00:39:09.459" style="s2">they&#39;re saying the truth the more</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.109" end="00:39:11.920" style="s2">profound truth than the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.459" end="00:39:12.999" style="s2">could say but they they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.920" end="00:39:14.709" style="s2">exactly what they&#39;re saying because</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.999" end="00:39:18.369" style="s2">there&#39;s an inspiration there&#39;s a muse</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.709" end="00:39:20.859" style="s2">that gives them the insight and so can I</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.369" end="00:39:23.859" style="s2">just agree maybe what they know is in</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.859" end="00:39:26.259" style="s2">the future they have an insight that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.859" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">unpacked that hasn&#39;t been unpacked yet</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.259" end="00:39:30.279" style="s2">so they have a prophetic as what I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:33.039" style="s2">wanted is prefer to gather the artist</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.279" end="00:39:35.559" style="s2">accredited since which you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.039" end="00:39:36.960" style="s2">access through mere intellectual idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.559" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">that the artist is prophetic</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:42.660" style="s2">is I think it&#39;s actually one of the it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">kind of one of the unspoken kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.660" end="00:39:45.990" style="s2">Gospels of modernity actually is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:48.570" style="s2">the artist is prophetic the only place</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.990" end="00:39:50.730" style="s2">where the prophet still lives within the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.570" end="00:39:53.010" style="s2">kind of deep disenchanted nature of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.730" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">modernity is in the artist they get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.010" end="00:39:57.810" style="s2">be the kind of prophetic voice and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:59.339" style="s2">Emerson&#39;s poet comes to mind right for</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.810" end="00:40:01.020" style="s2">Emerson the poet was much deeper for</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.339" end="00:40:02.550" style="s2">Emerson the Pope was like Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.020" end="00:40:06.420" style="s2">the greatest poet Jesus was the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.550" end="00:40:09.900" style="s2">poet right and so you end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.420" end="00:40:12.000" style="s2">this notion that the artist is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.900" end="00:40:13.790" style="s2">the person to live to and the german</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.000" end="00:40:17.660" style="s2">idealists ended up here too with</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.790" end="00:40:20.130" style="s2">romanticism and and they have their</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.660" end="00:40:22.560" style="s2">attempts to create a kind of uber</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.130" end="00:40:27.170" style="s2">christianity with all these symbolisms</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.560" end="00:40:32.700" style="s2">moved also towards a kind of artist as</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.170" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">social reform on guard and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.700" end="00:40:36.750" style="s2">look at artistic personality types from</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:43.050" style="s2">a psychological perspective you also see</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.750" end="00:40:45.510" style="s2">the sensitives and the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.050" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">aware of the war in heaven even as the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.510" end="00:40:49.349" style="s2">simulations going and everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:51.540" style="s2">trekked that the world to normal the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.349" end="00:40:53.160" style="s2">artists are usually clued in which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.540" end="00:40:55.410" style="s2">why I hold artists usually it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.160" end="00:40:57.180" style="s2">kind of a vulnerable population which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.410" end="00:41:00.109" style="s2">to say they end up medicated or</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.180" end="00:41:03.290" style="s2">institutionalized or addicted or</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.109" end="00:41:06.150" style="s2">unemployed underemployed miss employed</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.290" end="00:41:07.589" style="s2">so there&#39;s a noble Marge marginalize or</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.150" end="00:41:10.380" style="s2">systematic the marginalized and</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.589" end="00:41:12.119" style="s2">modernity writes that into the artists</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.380" end="00:41:15.089" style="s2">that this is what you have to struggle</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.119" end="00:41:16.890" style="s2">to mean I think I justify it but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.089" end="00:41:18.150" style="s2">know other societies have revered their</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.890" end="00:41:20.550" style="s2">prophets although they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.150" end="00:41:23.070" style="s2">persecuted but so yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.550" end="00:41:25.170" style="s2">looking to the aesthetic and realizing</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.070" end="00:41:29.010" style="s2">that although we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.170" end="00:41:30.869" style="s2">intellectual synthesis clearly the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.010" end="00:41:34.339" style="s2">for it to ground in the human heart is</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.869" end="00:41:37.230" style="s2">going to come from something more like</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.339" end="00:41:39.869" style="s2">an artistic movement and when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.230" end="00:41:42.990" style="s2">thinking of the move</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.869" end="00:41:45.330" style="s2">I think of from entertainment to culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.990" end="00:41:46.710" style="s2">right I think of the theater and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.330" end="00:41:47.579" style="s2">of the disappearance of the theater into</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.710" end="00:41:48.959" style="s2">the movie</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.579" end="00:41:51.869" style="s2">right now the potency and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.959" end="00:41:54.059" style="s2">possibility of the movie to do what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.869" end="00:41:57.079" style="s2">theater did for ancient Greece right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.059" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">to show us this complex cathartic</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.079" end="00:42:01.829" style="s2">beautiful thing that allows us to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:04.049" style="s2">people in a new way together like you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.829" end="00:42:06.900" style="s2">don&#39;t could do that but I&#39;ve seen one</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.049" end="00:42:11.479" style="s2">that&#39;s unhappy what I see is mostly an</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.900" end="00:42:15.959" style="s2">industry which is capturing attention</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.479" end="00:42:17.880" style="s2">and etc etc so yes part of this move out</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.959" end="00:42:20.160" style="s2">of entertainment and into culture is</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.880" end="00:42:22.920" style="s2">changing the incentive systems around</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.160" end="00:42:25.829" style="s2">cultural production and so that means</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.920" end="00:42:30.799" style="s2">moving the artists out of marginal into</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.829" end="00:42:34.369" style="s2">something like supported right and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.799" end="00:42:37.319" style="s2">through either federal or private</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.369" end="00:42:39.809" style="s2">reinvestment there&#39;s a serious thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.319" end="00:42:42.989" style="s2">now in this time of crisis when a whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.809" end="00:42:44.279" style="s2">bunch of money is moving around for</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.989" end="00:42:45.420" style="s2">better and for worse thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.279" end="00:42:47.549" style="s2">the hell&#39;s gonna happen of the artists</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.420" end="00:42:52.529" style="s2">right what that was gonna happen to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.549" end="00:42:55.799" style="s2">to the young yeah the yeah the people</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.529" end="00:42:57.869" style="s2">who would give us those symbols and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.799" end="00:43:01.259" style="s2">effective grounding point so we can move</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.869" end="00:43:02.789" style="s2">around the answer that&#39;s kind of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.259" end="00:43:04.259" style="s2">coming up when I&#39;m thinking what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.789" end="00:43:05.699" style="s2">said John and I&#39;m agreeing with you</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.259" end="00:43:07.499" style="s2">enough to say well yeah we actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.699" end="00:43:11.339" style="s2">attract that that&#39;s priority and figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.499" end="00:43:14.819" style="s2">out in schools and colleges and cities</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.339" end="00:43:18.329" style="s2">how we can support artists now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.819" end="00:43:20.009" style="s2">interesting problem this this this</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.329" end="00:43:21.569" style="s2">connects to a lot of the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.009" end="00:43:24.749" style="s2">actually wanted to talk to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.569" end="00:43:26.549" style="s2">about and both both of you if have been</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.749" end="00:43:29.519" style="s2">talking about stealing the culture I</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.549" end="00:43:32.489" style="s2">think that was John&#39;s phrase and your</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.519" end="00:43:36.390" style="s2">phrase Zak was your talk you talked</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.489" end="00:43:41.029" style="s2">about being an outlaw right and being an</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.390" end="00:43:42.959" style="s2">outlaw not in some kind of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.029" end="00:43:45.869" style="s2">immature</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.959" end="00:43:48.630" style="s2">adolescent you know rule-breaking sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.869" end="00:43:50.549" style="s2">but being an outlaw and as the person</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.630" end="00:43:53.249" style="s2">who breaks the rules so that the new</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.549" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">rule can emerge or the new culture can</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.249" end="00:43:57.780" style="s2">emerge and maybe that&#39;s related somehow</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:44:00.030" style="s2">to this prophetic artist</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.780" end="00:44:03.600" style="s2">personality we&#39;re talking about Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.030" end="00:44:06.150" style="s2">was eventually killed by the state and</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.600" end="00:44:08.340" style="s2">so I think that&#39;s relevant and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.150" end="00:44:11.300" style="s2">prophets no prophet what did Jesus say</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.340" end="00:44:13.290" style="s2">no prophet is honored in his own home</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.300" end="00:44:16.140" style="s2">what I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.290" end="00:44:18.660" style="s2">it may be answering that question are</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.140" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">people like Socrates and especially</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.660" end="00:44:25.140" style="s2">Plato but also platonist and people like</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:27.330" style="s2">Barfield and you know courage and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.140" end="00:44:29.610" style="s2">the early post content that Zack was</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.330" end="00:44:32.460" style="s2">alluding to and good that comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.610" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">as well um these are the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.460" end="00:44:37.980" style="s2">right and it was interesting that when</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:40.350" style="s2">Nietzsche pronounced he gave one clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.980" end="00:44:41.880" style="s2">example that he stood behind as an</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.350" end="00:44:44.310" style="s2">example of the uber mentioned it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.880" end="00:44:46.530" style="s2">Napoleon that wasn&#39;t Hegel it was good</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.310" end="00:44:47.850" style="s2">the artist was good too but the thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.530" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">about Goethe and the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.850" end="00:44:53.250" style="s2">Socrates right is you you baby</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:56.660" style="s2">let&#39;s do at least Plato cuz Plato said</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.250" end="00:44:56.660" style="s2">that he made Socrates more beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.050" end="00:45:03.990" style="s2">let&#39;s take Plato because the the the if</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.980" end="00:45:05.340" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me the artistry and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.990" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">argumentation are completely</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.340" end="00:45:11.100" style="s2">interpenetrating so the artistry and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:13.140" style="s2">argumentation and the aspiration are all</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.100" end="00:45:15.840" style="s2">deeply interwoven together like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.140" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">can&#39;t pull them apart like people you</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.840" end="00:45:19.860" style="s2">know Zack probably had this too maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:22.650" style="s2">you did Andrew in my education when they</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.860" end="00:45:24.150" style="s2">taught me Plato I was taught a great</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.650" end="00:45:25.890" style="s2">disservice because what would they would</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.150" end="00:45:27.300" style="s2">do is they would distract the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.890" end="00:45:29.130" style="s2">out of the drama</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.300" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">remember the your reference to theaters</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.130" end="00:45:33.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t it was right and they would and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">they would not even bringing up it was</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.600" end="00:45:39.030" style="s2">it was marginalized to obscurity the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:41.550" style="s2">aspiration all right so the artistry and</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.030" end="00:45:44.010" style="s2">the aspiration were put aside dismissed</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.550" end="00:45:47.420" style="s2">and then always held out is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.010" end="00:45:50.870" style="s2">argumentation but I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.420" end="00:45:55.710" style="s2">those kinds of people who can do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.870" end="00:45:59.610" style="s2">because I think they I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.710" end="00:46:01.110" style="s2">well I suspect I&#39;m trying to be very car</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.610" end="00:46:02.580" style="s2">sir I suspect that they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.110" end="00:46:04.290" style="s2">important than just the artist right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.580" end="00:46:05.820" style="s2">I think the aesthetic is important and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.290" end="00:46:08.940" style="s2">the artists are going to be do a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.820" end="00:46:11.700" style="s2">us but I think that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.940" end="00:46:17.160" style="s2">the those individuals who make great art</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.700" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">while also making new forms of thought</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.160" end="00:46:22.920" style="s2">and new ways of being that so the three</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">together I think they&#39;re the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.920" end="00:46:27.750" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting for me is I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">been trying to pick up on how do they</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.750" end="00:46:32.640" style="s2">communicate and how do they think with</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.540" end="00:46:35.310" style="s2">and through other people right</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.640" end="00:46:38.750" style="s2">the idea that dialectic is always this</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.310" end="00:46:42.900" style="s2">deeply interpenetration of argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.750" end="00:46:44.910" style="s2">aspiration and artistry and in which the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.900" end="00:46:46.680" style="s2">beauty and the truth seek this the</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.910" end="00:46:50.580" style="s2">beauty seeking and the truth seeking and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.680" end="00:46:53.430" style="s2">the transformation seeking are all bound</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.580" end="00:46:55.470" style="s2">up together and so I&#39;m kind of looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.430" end="00:46:56.340" style="s2">to see and so here&#39;s another hard</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.470" end="00:46:57.810" style="s2">question for you is that because you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:48:04.050" end="00:48:08.460" style="s2">looks more like an artist than the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.670" end="00:48:09.690" style="s2">scientists as Goethe did right but as</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.460" end="00:48:10.320" style="s2">many people know Goethe was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.690" end="00:48:12.900" style="s2">totally badass</p>

<p begin="00:48:20.940" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a richness there but yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.849" end="00:48:31.400" style="s2">point being that yeah the what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:34.170" style="s2">looking for is that complex truly after</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.400" end="00:48:36.420" style="s2">modern right to the the differentiation</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.420" end="00:48:40.920" style="s2">science from morality right the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.480" end="00:48:44.790" style="s2">that they need to be reintegrated in</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.920" end="00:48:49.560" style="s2">some new form that&#39;s the that&#39;s the in a</p>

<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:58.470" style="s2">the somehow reintegrate these these</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:49:00.359" style="s2">values fears and to somehow find forms</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.470" end="00:49:03.300" style="s2">of expression and communication and</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.359" end="00:49:05.099" style="s2">interaction that represent a new merger</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.300" end="00:49:06.510" style="s2">of them not a regression back to the</p>

<p begin="00:49:06.510" end="00:49:10.680" style="s2">together right where you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.450" end="00:49:11.880" style="s2">that&#39;s their work because there&#39;s so</p>

<p begin="00:49:11.880" end="00:49:14.849" style="s2">because we already know because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.050" end="00:49:16.619" style="s2">so many orifices in this face that there</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.849" end="00:49:18.050" style="s2">can&#39;t be some of it so like the dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.619" end="00:49:21.000" style="s2">don&#39;t look through the telescope Galileo</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.050" end="00:49:23.460" style="s2">pre-modern undifferentiated than the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.000" end="00:49:24.750" style="s2">differentiated modernity and then Weber</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.460" end="00:49:26.130" style="s2">lays out the problem right the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.750" end="00:49:28.380" style="s2">technocrats without hard and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.130" end="00:49:30.270" style="s2">aesthetic artists without any sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.380" end="00:49:33.810" style="s2">ethics and the fragmentation of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.270" end="00:49:36.680" style="s2">unity dimensional man and so always the</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.810" end="00:49:38.790" style="s2">quest has been this reintegration and</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.680" end="00:49:40.619" style="s2">one way to think about the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.790" end="00:49:43.050" style="s2">actually also as a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.619" end="00:49:45.180" style="s2">socio-economic thing here that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.050" end="00:49:47.670" style="s2">we need to heal certain underlying</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.180" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">social structures to allow for those</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.670" end="00:49:51.480" style="s2">forms of complex identity formation back</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">to the question of Education which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.480" end="00:49:55.170" style="s2">where you&#39;re moving this because the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:58.560" style="s2">caricature of the artist right now is</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.170" end="00:50:00.450" style="s2">some wounded degenerate tight who&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.560" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">of an egomaniac and doesn&#39;t get along</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.450" end="00:50:05.369" style="s2">with the rest of society and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:09.480" style="s2">narcissistic and and and the scientists</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.369" end="00:50:11.250" style="s2">and the scientists the and he&#39;s got new</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.480" end="00:50:13.230" style="s2">emotions and he might as well be a robot</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.250" end="00:50:16.079" style="s2">right and the politician is cutthroat</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.230" end="00:50:17.970" style="s2">and the businessman has no morals or</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.079" end="00:50:20.010" style="s2">aesthetic sense and so that sense that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.970" end="00:50:22.290" style="s2">there&#39;s each person because this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.010" end="00:50:23.970" style="s2">fragmented so can I say that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.290" end="00:50:27.300" style="s2">artist is actually the total person</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.970" end="00:50:30.510" style="s2">right it&#39;s not it&#39;s not being an artist</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.300" end="00:50:32.250" style="s2">as a specialized activity in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.510" end="00:50:34.370" style="s2">being an artist is is what we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.250" end="00:50:36.920" style="s2">sort of the total person</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.370" end="00:50:40.070" style="s2">meant to be on some level right whether</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.920" end="00:50:41.660" style="s2">you actually art or not if we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.070" end="00:50:43.490" style="s2">artists in that sense that we were where</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.660" end="00:50:46.310" style="s2">the artist is the one who finds a way to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.490" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">make a life that reunites the fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.310" end="00:50:52.820" style="s2">value spheres of modernity right that</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:54.050" style="s2">that like I said the Emersonian poet who</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.820" end="00:50:55.820" style="s2">integrates the good the true and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.050" end="00:51:00.020" style="s2">beautiful if that&#39;s the artist talking</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.820" end="00:51:03.500" style="s2">about then yes but again the the artists</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.020" end="00:51:08.660" style="s2">of modernity right the mad genius like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.500" end="00:51:13.160" style="s2">derelict marginalized artist is as much</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.660" end="00:51:15.170" style="s2">of a kind of character as the modern</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.160" end="00:51:17.630" style="s2">businessman or the modern politician yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.170" end="00:51:20.090" style="s2">also stopped from having aesthetic sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.630" end="00:51:23.090" style="s2">or an ethical sense and so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.090" end="00:51:28.730" style="s2">just that sense again the whole person</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.090" end="00:51:32.450" style="s2">where you can essentially not be</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.730" end="00:51:35.450" style="s2">fragmented at such a root level</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.450" end="00:51:40.190" style="s2">alongside clefts and identity as the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.450" end="00:51:42.410" style="s2">good deterrent the beautiful and I get</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.190" end="00:51:44.750" style="s2">the sense that like when we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.410" end="00:51:46.820" style="s2">the other day I mentioned poetry and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.750" end="00:51:49.190" style="s2">John kind of jumped and said no because</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.820" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">of the way people think of a poet today</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.190" end="00:51:57.350" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s this contempt for poetry</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:59.600" style="s2">right and then maybe this event that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.350" end="00:52:02.570" style="s2">happening right now when people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.600" end="00:52:04.160" style="s2">stuck in their houses etc etc maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.570" end="00:52:07.490" style="s2">will start to see a little bit like the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.160" end="00:52:11.060" style="s2">value of that of the poetic poetry are</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.490" end="00:52:12.410" style="s2">oh I agree I think that crisis it does</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.060" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">two things and they play off against</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.410" end="00:52:15.890" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:17.840" style="s2">I mean it creates Dom aside it because</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.890" end="00:52:19.610" style="s2">people connection it brings on</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.840" end="00:52:21.470" style="s2">loneliness it puts them into this weird</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.610" end="00:52:25.370" style="s2">and threatening you know almost demonic</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.470" end="00:52:26.750" style="s2">you know world view and so in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.370" end="00:52:29.720" style="s2">and we&#39;re already seeing this it</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.750" end="00:52:30.950" style="s2">exacerbates the meaning crisis I predict</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.720" end="00:52:33.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to see a mental health</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.950" end="00:52:36.260" style="s2">crisis shortly on the heels of this that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.980" end="00:52:40.640" style="s2">is going to also be Titanic and cause a</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.260" end="00:52:43.640" style="s2">suffering and death but Pressley because</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.640" end="00:52:45.710" style="s2">of that people are right also turning to</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.710" end="00:53:42.430" style="s2">then Harbor of losses argument is part</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.930" end="00:53:45.170" style="s2">of what drives that fragmentation is a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.430" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">normativity of autonomy reason is</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.170" end="00:53:50.510" style="s2">autonomous and therefore it cannot and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:53.270" style="s2">should not be integrated or reduced it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.510" end="00:53:57.710" style="s2">in a sense even in commensurable from</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.270" end="00:53:59.750" style="s2">right from morality which is then also</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.710" end="00:54:01.720" style="s2">autonomous the right it is a tournament</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.750" end="00:54:06.250" style="s2">and that&#39;s autonomous from taste</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.720" end="00:54:10.490" style="s2">so the normativity of autonomy right arm</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.250" end="00:54:14.599" style="s2">is for grounding and that is if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.490" end="00:54:19.790" style="s2">allow me don&#39;t know that&#39;s an autonomy I</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.599" end="00:54:22.339" style="s2">mean maybe Heidegger and my colleague my</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.790" end="00:54:24.430" style="s2">Johannes Nina Hauser that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:54:26.930" end="00:54:34.130" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s ultimately a Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.980" end="00:54:41.000" style="s2">normativity yeah no I I am ultimately an</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.130" end="00:54:43.970" style="s2">isolated right thing and itself and and</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.000" end="00:54:46.670" style="s2">and mine or and the only normativity</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.970" end="00:54:47.750" style="s2">upon me is my is my autonomy and all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.670" end="00:54:49.460" style="s2">these do you see what I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.750" end="00:54:53.420" style="s2">out there&#39;s a normativity of autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.460" end="00:54:55.940" style="s2">now Tillich in his worth tried to break</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.420" end="00:54:58.099" style="s2">out of that he tried to say there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.940" end="00:55:00.290" style="s2">three possible kinds of normativity</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.099" end="00:55:01.110" style="s2">there&#39;s of course the normativity of</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.290" end="00:55:03.660" style="s2">autonomy and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.110" end="00:55:06.570" style="s2">is pervasive in the cognitive grammar of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.660" end="00:55:11.610" style="s2">modernity and then he said but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.570" end="00:55:13.680" style="s2">also of course the normativity I called</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.610" end="00:55:16.020" style="s2">it heteronomy in which somebody is</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.680" end="00:55:18.030" style="s2">imposing on us and this is a this is an</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.020" end="00:55:19.770" style="s2">authoritarian of one form of another and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.030" end="00:55:21.870" style="s2">he was he was brilliant enough to see</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.770" end="00:55:25.620" style="s2">how the Nazis were playing those two off</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.870" end="00:55:27.660" style="s2">against each other when they I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.620" end="00:55:29.940" style="s2">want to bring up the Nazis very key it</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.660" end="00:55:32.100" style="s2">this this analysis affording it came in</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.940" end="00:55:32.940" style="s2">sight and then he proposed you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.100" end="00:55:36.480" style="s2">where I&#39;m going with this</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.940" end="00:55:39.390" style="s2">he posts he those two he said what we</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.480" end="00:55:42.780" style="s2">really need because the first emphasizes</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.390" end="00:55:46.350" style="s2">subjectivity right autonomy the second</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.780" end="00:55:49.110" style="s2">that localizes everything in objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.350" end="00:55:51.870" style="s2">right but he said there&#39;s a third which</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.110" end="00:55:54.870" style="s2">is the enemy and this is being god</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.870" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">governed right and and this brings us</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.870" end="00:55:58.740" style="s2">back again to the well functioning</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:56:01.770" style="s2">religion the idea is there are a certain</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.740" end="00:56:03.960" style="s2">form because when people feel called by</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.770" end="00:56:06.420" style="s2">God they don&#39;t feel that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.960" end="00:56:07.650" style="s2">demonically possessed but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.420" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re acting autonomously</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.650" end="00:56:13.260" style="s2">they feel it&#39;s if they feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:14.910" style="s2">simultaneously that they are moving</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.260" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">they&#39;re being moved by something beyond</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.910" end="00:56:18.420" style="s2">themselves but they&#39;re also being moved</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:21.680" style="s2">by something that is helping them to</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.420" end="00:56:26.100" style="s2">realize themselves in an important way</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.680" end="00:56:29.640" style="s2">and so I think part I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.100" end="00:56:31.410" style="s2">deep reason by and do why you brought</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.640" end="00:56:34.620" style="s2">this up and I think it&#39;s even a deep</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.410" end="00:56:37.800" style="s2">fear since you suck why you circle back</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.620" end="00:56:40.230" style="s2">up well function religion like if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.800" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">going to break out of the fragmentation</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.230" end="00:56:47.520" style="s2">we have to challenge the normativity</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:50.910" style="s2">that drives the fragmentation which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.520" end="00:56:54.810" style="s2">the absolute value radiation of autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.910" end="00:56:58.170" style="s2">as the final way in which all moment Eva</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.810" end="00:56:59.730" style="s2">T is generated no that&#39;s not to give in</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.170" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">to hitter on ax me and say Oh what we</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.730" end="00:57:03.150" style="s2">need is the strong man and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:05.070" style="s2">authoritarian structure and Tillich was</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.150" end="00:57:06.900" style="s2">really playing with the idea that what</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.070" end="00:57:10.410" style="s2">Christianity was trying to offer people</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.900" end="00:57:12.330" style="s2">was the animus um normativity and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.410" end="00:57:14.310" style="s2">would break us out and we help to</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.330" end="00:57:17.190" style="s2">reunite us as an entire person</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.310" end="00:57:20.190" style="s2">well that&#39;s very abstract so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.190" end="00:57:23.100" style="s2">exactly what Zack was talking about when</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.190" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">when you talk about the unique self</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.100" end="00:57:28.680" style="s2">Symphony I have it written down here in</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:32.850" style="s2">a mystical body of Christ it&#39;s breaking</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.680" end="00:57:36.390" style="s2">out modern idea of self right our modern</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.850" end="00:57:38.070" style="s2">idea of self into something else you</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.390" end="00:57:42.450" style="s2">call that sovereign self I&#39;m not quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.070" end="00:57:44.880" style="s2">sure I understand what I want to refine</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.450" end="00:57:47.940" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what the back was that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.880" end="00:57:49.530" style="s2">exactly Zacks yes concept and he also</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.940" end="00:57:52.470" style="s2">you&#39;re also said that&#39;s the mystical</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.530" end="00:57:55.770" style="s2">body of Christ right yes yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.470" end="00:57:57.300" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.770" end="00:57:59.100" style="s2">conventional way in but yes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.300" end="00:58:01.050" style="s2">eventually is in one consistent the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.100" end="00:58:02.340" style="s2">mystical body of Christ and it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.050" end="00:58:03.720" style="s2">interesting here is that we can go back</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.340" end="00:58:06.600" style="s2">to the developmental theory because that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.720" end="00:58:10.590" style="s2">stack you just ran from heteronomous to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.600" end="00:58:12.780" style="s2">autonomous - what was it Theo the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.590" end="00:58:16.310" style="s2">Ottomans beyond the anima stright which</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.780" end="00:58:20.190" style="s2">you can also think of it like theosis</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.310" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">only yeah and so that that stacks very</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.190" end="00:58:24.930" style="s2">closely to the pre conventional</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:26.850" style="s2">conventional post conventional way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.930" end="00:58:29.790" style="s2">thinking about moral development which</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.850" end="00:58:32.250" style="s2">is of course inspired by count through</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.790" end="00:58:34.920" style="s2">Kohlberg and picked up by Hamas as part</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.250" end="00:58:36.390" style="s2">of our bosses moral and political theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.920" end="00:58:38.070" style="s2">and when you look at how our mosques</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.390" end="00:58:41.990" style="s2">fear of democracy he&#39;s actually trying</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.070" end="00:58:44.250" style="s2">to overcome the autonomously bastes</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.990" end="00:58:47.640" style="s2">rationality of the subject of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.250" end="00:58:51.150" style="s2">and get in its place not a Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.640" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">based notion of post conventionality but</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.150" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">a post conventionality nonetheless and</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:59:00.600" style="s2">so you end up having a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:06.120" style="s2">about moral development we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.600" end="00:59:09.330" style="s2">higher reaches you get a a transcending</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.120" end="00:59:12.920" style="s2">of the modern autonomous kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.330" end="00:59:15.630" style="s2">subject and a relinquishing into</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.920" end="00:59:17.010" style="s2">community and also into transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.630" end="00:59:20.310" style="s2">people that realized Kolchak had a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.010" end="00:59:24.180" style="s2">famous comer had a famous 7th level like</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.310" end="00:59:25.150" style="s2">he had a 6 6 stage model for his whole</p>

<p begin="00:59:25.150" end="00:59:31.570" style="s2">but he ended up in a essay writing about</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.570" end="00:59:37.690" style="s2">exemplars were like Spinoza and Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.510" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">and teal er de chardin and Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.690" end="00:59:43.900" style="s2">Aurelius and people who got all the way</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:45.970" style="s2">up to the post conventional autonomy</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.900" end="00:59:49.540" style="s2">that one would expect and then also gave</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.970" end="00:59:51.400" style="s2">over the self and kind of Abraham has</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.540" end="00:59:54.010" style="s2">those self-transcending kind of giving</p>

<p begin="00:59:54.010" end="01:00:01.120" style="s2">and and so that yeah that&#39;s a different</p>

<p begin="01:06:40.810" end="01:06:46.030" style="s2">it right it doesn&#39;t belong to us we</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.450" end="01:06:48.070" style="s2">belong to it it takes on a life of its</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.030" end="01:06:52.690" style="s2">own and here&#39;s the thing and not only it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.070" end="01:06:55.150" style="s2">not only right it is not only connected</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.690" end="01:06:57.550" style="s2">to us it&#39;s also connected to the way</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.150" end="01:07:00.070" style="s2">intelligibility and even reality are</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.550" end="01:07:02.260" style="s2">unfolding and that that&#39;s ultimately I</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.070" end="01:07:06.040" style="s2">think why we belong to it rather than if</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.260" end="01:07:09.850" style="s2">belonging to us and so part of what I</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.040" end="01:07:17.620" style="s2">think the sage artists can do is in is</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.850" end="01:07:21.100" style="s2">invoke do logos and invoke that as you</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.620" end="01:07:23.410" style="s2">know the thing the the sort of trans</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.100" end="01:07:25.300" style="s2">systemic thing that allows us to bridge</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.410" end="01:07:28.510" style="s2">between the normativity an important</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.300" end="01:07:30.550" style="s2">length and I think the so I want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.510" end="01:07:33.550" style="s2">throw in that one of the things that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.550" end="01:07:37.030" style="s2">supported the autonomy and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.550" end="01:07:38.110" style="s2">subjectivity you know model and and then</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.030" end="01:07:39.790" style="s2">and then we have this thing called</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.110" end="01:07:41.830" style="s2">authenticity which isn&#39;t part of your</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.790" end="01:07:45.240" style="s2">sense it just basically means sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.830" end="01:07:49.270" style="s2">celebrating your autonomy right um but</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.240" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">one of one of the one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.270" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get at right is this idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:08:11.160" style="s2">that in the dialog and in the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:11.160" style="s2">we have access to right a way like</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.530" end="01:08:16.030" style="s2">when you swing you read when you read</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.880" end="01:08:18.500" style="s2">the dialogues it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.030" end="01:08:20.800" style="s2">argumentation that&#39;s in competition ways</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.500" end="01:08:23.690" style="s2">of life are being brought into</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.800" end="01:08:26.420" style="s2">competition but not just in an arbitrary</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.690" end="01:08:27.620" style="s2">fashion that they&#39;re being regulated but</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.420" end="01:08:30.950" style="s2">is that&#39;s the right word there being</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.620" end="01:08:32.810" style="s2">regulated by the logos and everybody has</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.950" end="01:08:34.820" style="s2">to be willing to follow the logos which</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.810" end="01:08:38.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just drifting subjectively</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.820" end="01:08:41.540" style="s2">it means you know answering the call</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.540" end="01:08:43.850" style="s2">being responsive to the way it&#39;s taken</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.540" end="01:08:46.850" style="s2">on a life of its own and that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.850" end="01:08:49.220" style="s2">polarity it is it&#39;s not grounded in us</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.850" end="01:08:51.320" style="s2">it&#39;s grounded between us and each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.220" end="01:08:53.480" style="s2">and the end our culture of</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.320" end="01:08:55.820" style="s2">intelligibility and ultimately the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.480" end="01:08:59.150" style="s2">in which that culture is embedded like</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.820" end="01:09:01.490" style="s2">the logos the logos exemplifies the</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.150" end="01:09:05.180" style="s2">normativity of our embeddedness and in</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.490" end="01:09:07.430" style="s2">accent for us and I think that is a way</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.180" end="01:09:10.670" style="s2">in which linked with sort of post</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.430" end="01:09:13.300" style="s2">conventional thinking it can help us to</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.670" end="01:09:15.200" style="s2">get the kind of Fionna --mess</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.300" end="01:09:21.410" style="s2">normativity that I&#39;m trying to talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.200" end="01:09:23.810" style="s2">about the the you know well we talked</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.410" end="01:09:25.670" style="s2">about this and Zack Zack as you use it</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.810" end="01:09:29.540" style="s2">there&#39;s something sacred or perhaps even</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.670" end="01:09:30.950" style="s2">divine about the logos that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.540" end="01:09:33.980" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get it to take the</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.980" end="01:09:38.150" style="s2">till it was 20 towards did that make</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.870" end="01:09:39.680" style="s2">sense I was struggling there did no I</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.150" end="01:09:40.850" style="s2">mean it was it&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.680" end="01:09:42.320" style="s2">international essentially if I&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.850" end="01:09:44.870" style="s2">us that this artists we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.320" end="01:09:46.250" style="s2">about this like Gertie and RDS who</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.870" end="01:09:47.780" style="s2">integrates the value spheres what</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.250" end="01:09:49.010" style="s2">they&#39;re creating there were there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.780" end="01:09:50.870" style="s2">like they&#39;re they&#39;re inviting us</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.010" end="01:09:53.320" style="s2">actually to something into something</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.870" end="01:09:56.450" style="s2">other virtual some kind of ritual of</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.320" end="01:09:59.000" style="s2">interaction and communication where the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.450" end="01:10:02.060" style="s2">logos is revealed between us right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.000" end="01:10:04.310" style="s2">the artist needs to create power</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.060" end="01:10:05.480" style="s2">reflected yeah perform it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.310" end="01:10:07.220" style="s2">performed that&#39;s why theater is so</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.480" end="01:10:09.650" style="s2">interesting and a figure that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.220" end="01:10:12.500" style="s2">break down that fourth wall and engage</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.650" end="01:10:14.750" style="s2">the audience you know and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.500" end="01:10:16.400" style="s2">always hints in postmodern art that</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.750" end="01:10:19.220" style="s2">there was something trying to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.400" end="01:10:21.290" style="s2">that would actually embrace the audience</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.220" end="01:10:22.920" style="s2">and blur the line between the art and</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.290" end="01:10:25.530" style="s2">non-art</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.920" end="01:10:29.130" style="s2">though in essentially Reese Accra lies</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.530" end="01:10:31.500" style="s2">all of life by casting the veil of art</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.130" end="01:10:32.969" style="s2">across all things and so that notion</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.500" end="01:10:35.460" style="s2">that the artists were looking for</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.969" end="01:10:38.460" style="s2">someone who invites us into a new ritual</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.460" end="01:10:42.510" style="s2">and way of being worth through it we</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.460" end="01:10:45.090" style="s2">can&#39;t help but be swept into the logo</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.510" end="01:10:48.150" style="s2">essentially and that were going full</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.090" end="01:10:51.270" style="s2">circle into the logos mysticism right of</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.150" end="01:10:54.179" style="s2">the the Western tradition rooted in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.270" end="01:10:57.060" style="s2">Neoplatonic stuff and yet a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.179" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to there&#39;s a way to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.060" end="01:11:05.760" style="s2">a human civilization so I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.000" end="01:11:08.910" style="s2">Thainess here in particular he he almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.760" end="01:11:10.590" style="s2">built a city yes big anomalously yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.910" end="01:11:12.150" style="s2">exactly he must build a city and so he</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.590" end="01:11:14.130" style="s2">was in this kind of civilizational</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.150" end="01:11:17.429" style="s2">design mindset from a deeply meta</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.130" end="01:11:19.739" style="s2">philosophical the Platonic view and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.429" end="01:11:22.980" style="s2">my sense is that yeah in this such a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.739" end="01:11:25.080" style="s2">society there would be some kind of and</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.980" end="01:11:27.540" style="s2">again when you think properly</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.080" end="01:11:29.219" style="s2">functioning religion it&#39;s not just like</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.540" end="01:11:31.290" style="s2">the books and stuff right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.219" end="01:11:32.790" style="s2">there&#39;s a building and we all get there</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.290" end="01:11:35.310" style="s2">and we&#39;re in it together and we do</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.790" end="01:11:37.800" style="s2">something and what that something is is</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.310" end="01:11:39.810" style="s2">a ritual that would be tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.800" end="01:11:41.699" style="s2">beautiful and that would bend the</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.810" end="01:11:44.489" style="s2">conception of it would be as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.699" end="01:11:46.260" style="s2">describing John it would be not us all</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.489" end="01:11:49.140" style="s2">looking at one thing like some medieval</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.260" end="01:11:51.510" style="s2">ritual but in fact this moving between</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.140" end="01:11:54.540" style="s2">us of the Holy Spirit and of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.510" end="01:11:56.190" style="s2">dialogue goes yeah where the evidence is</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.540" end="01:11:57.750" style="s2">clear just by that were fact we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.190" end="01:12:00.090" style="s2">together looking one other&#39;s eyes and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.750" end="01:12:01.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what can happen sometimes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.090" end="01:12:02.969" style="s2">why a a works and that&#39;s why circling</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.800" end="01:12:05.910" style="s2">works at a bunch of other things work</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.969" end="01:12:07.590" style="s2">because you just it descends it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.910" end="01:12:10.949" style="s2">you&#39;re looking between the eyes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.590" end="01:12:15.320" style="s2">a self-evident value in the experience</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.949" end="01:12:17.699" style="s2">of their personhood and co-relating and</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.320" end="01:12:19.530" style="s2">it&#39;s funny it&#39;s like they always say</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.699" end="01:12:21.060" style="s2">you&#39;re selling water by the well or</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.530" end="01:12:22.500" style="s2">selling water by the river or something</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.060" end="01:12:24.230" style="s2">like that like this is one of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.500" end="01:12:27.410" style="s2">sayings you know and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.230" end="01:12:30.080" style="s2">that it&#39;s right there yeah and I likes</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.410" end="01:12:31.730" style="s2">the idea that the logos is building</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.080" end="01:12:35.660" style="s2">something like you said building a city</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.730" end="01:12:38.180" style="s2">or a Patronus is building a city that</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.660" end="01:12:40.610" style="s2">strikes me as that&#39;s the thing that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.180" end="01:12:44.840" style="s2">building the city of God is the logos or</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.610" end="01:12:48.110" style="s2">you know if we got in yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.840" end="01:12:50.210" style="s2">Craig turns there&#39;s two myths total</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.110" end="01:12:51.410" style="s2">identification crisis identified with</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.210" end="01:12:52.840" style="s2">the body of the church but Christ is</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.410" end="01:12:55.640" style="s2">also identified with the logos of God</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.840" end="01:12:57.950" style="s2">right and it&#39;s because I said because he</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.640" end="01:12:58.850" style="s2">medias between them and he creates ways</p>

<p begin="01:14:06.230" end="01:14:09.739" style="s2">yeah like I came into the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.090" end="01:14:11.540" style="s2">with a survey that it was going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.739" end="01:14:14.120" style="s2">good conversation I had no idea exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.540" end="01:14:15.739" style="s2">how it was gonna go but I knew given the</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.120" end="01:14:18.200" style="s2">nature of reality in my experience with</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.739" end="01:14:20.270" style="s2">all you guys that there was a sense that</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.200" end="01:14:23.780" style="s2">it was going to work I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.270" end="01:14:26.180" style="s2">exactly how this is like a micro example</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.780" end="01:14:27.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not like a deep faith but</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.180" end="01:14:29.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense that reality holds</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.830" end="01:14:31.520" style="s2">together and so similarly when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.900" end="01:14:34.510" style="s2">with people in one of these situations</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.520" end="01:14:36.940" style="s2">were the logos emergence</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.510" end="01:14:38.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean by faith reality</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.940" end="01:14:42.490" style="s2">holding together or something reality</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.830" end="01:14:44.200" style="s2">holds together that there&#39;s a and that</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.490" end="01:14:47.220" style="s2">we&#39;re intimate with reality that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.200" end="01:14:50.650" style="s2">not absent from our perception and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.220" end="01:14:52.570" style="s2">the faith read the reality of other</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.650" end="01:14:54.940" style="s2">people for example is what it emerges</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.570" end="01:14:58.270" style="s2">when you&#39;re gonna dialog us that if we</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.940" end="01:15:00.040" style="s2">trust the conversation and trust reason</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.270" end="01:15:02.260" style="s2">in our better lights and the care we</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.040" end="01:15:06.010" style="s2">have for one another that we&#39;ll find the</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.260" end="01:15:07.600" style="s2">solution and so it&#39;s a faith in humanity</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.010" end="01:15:10.750" style="s2">needs you&#39;re certain which then and then</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.600" end="01:15:12.550" style="s2">I can extend different notes that</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.750" end="01:15:14.380" style="s2">everything&#39;s gonna work out and be fine</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.550" end="01:15:17.170" style="s2">different for the faith that one won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.380" end="01:15:19.720" style="s2">go to heaven and it requires time too it</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.170" end="01:15:22.840" style="s2">requires an unfolding of time it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.720" end="01:15:24.580" style="s2">just be rushed or constructed right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.840" end="01:15:28.240" style="s2">covering becoming back to Kairos yeah</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.580" end="01:15:29.710" style="s2">yeah I wanted to say how much Zach said</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.240" end="01:15:30.910" style="s2">I think he hears again what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.710" end="01:15:33.310" style="s2">serving we&#39;re pulling again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.910" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">pulling apart two notions of faith right</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.310" end="01:15:38.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a one that was grounded in sort</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:39.880" style="s2">of you know the emergence of</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.380" end="01:15:42.460" style="s2">subjectivity which is the assertion</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.880" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">might be a willful assertion against</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.460" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">evidence which has become a primitive</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.730" style="s2">model whereas kind of faith that Zack is</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:50.380" style="s2">talking about and I&#39;m talking about tune</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.730" end="01:15:52.390" style="s2">especially some of the conversations I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.380" end="01:15:55.360" style="s2">having with Jordan Hall is this sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.390" end="01:15:56.440" style="s2">you know of continuity of contact and</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.360" end="01:15:58.300" style="s2">you&#39;re not trying to come to closure</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.440" end="01:16:00.040" style="s2">what you&#39;re trying to do is always</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.300" end="01:16:02.830" style="s2">educate right relationship right</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.040" end="01:16:05.080" style="s2">relationship isn&#39;t a gold state it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.830" end="01:16:07.240" style="s2">like Keeks does great work on this he</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.080" end="01:16:09.640" style="s2">says don&#39;t confuse goals with ideals and</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.240" end="01:16:11.740" style="s2">I and we even misused the word ideal he</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.640" end="01:16:13.780" style="s2">said he complained you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.740" end="01:16:15.550" style="s2">bull state I&#39;m hungry and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.780" end="01:16:17.980" style="s2">to be hungry so I can get to a state</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.550" end="01:16:23.170" style="s2">that realizes and then I can rest there</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.980" end="01:16:25.840" style="s2">right there is ideals are not states of</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.170" end="01:16:29.890" style="s2">completion and finality in which you</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.840" end="01:16:34.570" style="s2">rest satisfied my ideals are constant</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.890" end="01:16:36.400" style="s2">right well they&#39;re there they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.570" end="01:16:38.680" style="s2">they&#39;re there constraint on the manner</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.400" end="01:16:40.210" style="s2">of how you do it but honesty isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.680" end="01:16:41.740" style="s2">place I&#39;m trying to get to I can now say</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.210" end="01:16:44.350" style="s2">okay I&#39;m done with honesty I don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.740" end="01:16:46.810" style="s2">honesty I&#39;m finished it all right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.350" end="01:16:48.280" style="s2">complete honesty isn&#39;t instead it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.810" end="01:16:50.890" style="s2">ideal it&#39;s a whole it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.280" end="01:16:52.600" style="s2">a of being in right relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.890" end="01:16:55.030" style="s2">yourself and other people in an ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.600" end="01:16:58.090" style="s2">fashion yeah so there&#39;s any completeness</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.030" end="01:16:59.920" style="s2">- right it&#39;s never completed right you</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.090" end="01:17:02.200" style="s2">know like sorry and this just comes to</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.920" end="01:17:04.510" style="s2">my mind like Moses never gets to the the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.200" end="01:17:06.550" style="s2">promised land and John the Baptist has</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.510" end="01:17:09.910" style="s2">to die before you know it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.550" end="01:17:11.860" style="s2">all sort of like we&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.910" end="01:17:14.770" style="s2">on faith because it will never realize</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.860" end="01:17:17.260" style="s2">that final construction or that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.770" end="01:17:19.420" style="s2">not perfection right right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.260" end="01:17:22.540" style="s2">and but ultimately we&#39;re we&#39;re which</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.420" end="01:17:25.300" style="s2">find the the faith is always affording</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.540" end="01:17:28.240" style="s2">the emergence precisely because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.300" end="01:17:30.220" style="s2">only in the logos of emergence that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.240" end="01:17:31.390" style="s2">move into post conventionality that we</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.220" end="01:17:34.300" style="s2">can be postformal</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.390" end="01:17:37.240" style="s2">that we can find the resources to</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.300" end="01:17:40.510" style="s2">respond to Kairos it&#39;s also that that</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.240" end="01:17:43.510" style="s2">the you can&#39;t write you can&#39;t make it a</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.510" end="01:17:45.070" style="s2">goal okay you know 20 minutes in logos</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.510" end="01:17:46.600" style="s2">is going to appear in the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.070" end="01:17:48.700" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna happen</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.600" end="01:17:52.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not gonna happen in fact taking</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.700" end="01:17:55.330" style="s2">that stance will kill it right will kill</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.600" end="01:17:57.400" style="s2">it completely well it won&#39;t chill out it</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.330" end="01:17:59.710" style="s2">won&#39;t show up sorry Zach you wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.400" end="01:18:01.720" style="s2">say something no I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.710" end="01:18:03.220" style="s2">vibing on it and I&#39;m thinking with the</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.720" end="01:18:05.340" style="s2">ideal notion and I&#39;m thinking of Tillich</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.220" end="01:18:08.200" style="s2">too in the his notion of idolatry right</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.340" end="01:18:09.580" style="s2">just yeah you invest something with</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.200" end="01:18:12.760" style="s2">infinite Worth that&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.580" end="01:18:14.680" style="s2">infinite and the proper ideal would be</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.760" end="01:18:16.150" style="s2">infinite that you precisely couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.680" end="01:18:18.010" style="s2">achieve it in this life and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.150" end="01:18:19.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve adopted it as your ideal on some</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.010" end="01:18:22.240" style="s2">of the most compelling religious ideals</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.960" end="01:18:24.340" style="s2">have that quality like Buddhahood for</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.240" end="01:18:26.230" style="s2">example like media which contains a</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.340" end="01:18:28.300" style="s2">whole bunch of qualities that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.230" end="01:18:31.540" style="s2">unlikely to achieve in this lifetime but</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.300" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">wish you were strong right again even</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.540" end="01:18:35.230" style="s2">the love of wisdom for luck finally oh</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:36.670" style="s2">so Vanya you are always in love with</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.230" end="01:18:38.890" style="s2">wisdom because you would never be a god</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.670" end="01:18:41.710" style="s2">you would never be perfectly wise right</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.890" end="01:18:44.230" style="s2">yeah exactly answer that that it is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.710" end="01:18:46.510" style="s2">infinitely pursuable like asymptotically</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.230" end="01:18:51.070" style="s2">throughout life basically it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.510" end="01:18:54.250" style="s2">notion of the of the ideal which is you</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.070" end="01:18:57.430" style="s2">know very different from other ways of</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.250" end="01:18:59.539" style="s2">having motivation and so the question of</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.430" end="01:19:02.750" style="s2">how the post conventional identity</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.539" end="01:19:05.150" style="s2">his ideal driven wear has many forms of</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.750" end="01:19:09.199" style="s2">conventional identity or goal driven is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.150" end="01:19:10.190" style="s2">an important statement and as we know</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.199" end="01:19:11.840" style="s2">for most of the happiness research</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.190" end="01:19:14.809" style="s2">actually when you meet your goal watch</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.840" end="01:19:18.500" style="s2">out because that&#39;s when the depression</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.809" end="01:19:20.989" style="s2">sets then often people winning gold</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.500" end="01:19:22.280" style="s2">medals and and Super Bowls and then get</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.989" end="01:19:25.579" style="s2">suicidal afterwards because they</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.280" end="01:19:30.199" style="s2">actually did it whereas the ideal is</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.579" end="01:19:35.539" style="s2">actually infinitely renewable like</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.199" end="01:19:37.429" style="s2">resource of identity construction you</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.539" end="01:19:40.699" style="s2">know right it if it in finite game it</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.429" end="01:19:42.679" style="s2">right yeah courses you know that follows</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.699" end="01:19:45.800" style="s2">up on his previous book the religious</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.679" end="01:19:47.599" style="s2">case against belief and you know playing</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.800" end="01:19:51.679" style="s2">a finite game versus playing an infinite</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.599" end="01:19:56.150" style="s2">game and I think playing in a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.679" end="01:19:58.789" style="s2">serious play game like playing a musical</p>
