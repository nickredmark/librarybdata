<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">fun to see where it goes</p>

<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:01:01.039" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.000" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">a non-dualist and an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.320" style="s2">now i wonder what the hell is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">non-dualist</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.320" end="00:01:07.600" style="s2">in my life and i survived to live to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.159" style="s2">talk</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.600" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">to see the other day so i suspect that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.159" end="00:01:13.439" style="s2">not it</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">uh and i&#39;m also definitely a non-dualist</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.439" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">in the cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">sense and i suspect that&#39;s not it either</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:20.960" style="s2">uh in in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:23.200" style="s2">lingo what&#39;s an on duelist oh well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.960" end="00:01:26.240" style="s2">getting we&#39;re going pretty deep early</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">so nondualist refers to a number of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.240" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">eastern traditions such as</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:31.759" style="s2">zen buddhism and advice vendatta that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">suggests</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.759" end="00:01:38.400" style="s2">essentially that there is one reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">and we are that one reality so</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.400" end="00:01:42.079" style="s2">so we have begun in the right place all</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">right that&#39;s a good play i guess it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.079" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">good place to be still sounds a little</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.840" style="s2">mystical to me but we&#39;ll dig into it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:50.880" style="s2">little bit a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.840" end="00:01:53.200" style="s2">uh andrew and this is from his website i</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.880" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">ask and seek to answer the most basic</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.200" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">questions of human existence with others</p>

<p begin="00:02:24.640" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">capitalist but</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">yeah well yeah he did but he just told</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">him to</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">nunnery or whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">i hope you don&#39;t end up like him right</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">well it sounds like an interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:44.239" style="s2">life choice to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">worldly philosopher yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.239" end="00:02:49.200" style="s2">precisely what philosophy used to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">and so you&#39;re right to mention socrates</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.200" end="00:02:53.599" style="s2">there are other figures we know of in</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">philosophical tradition all of whom</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.599" end="00:02:56.239" style="s2">thought that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">the most fundamental questions needed to</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.239" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">be asked with</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">other people with whom one was living in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:03.200" style="s2">order to help them</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.800" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">clarify their basic understandings of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.200" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">what a good life is or</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:10.159" style="s2">what reality is or why we&#39;re here so</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">indeed yeah so it&#39;s only i saw a tweet</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.159" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">you had</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.959" end="00:03:14.959" style="s2">some months back about your mis your</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:16.840" style="s2">misgivings about</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">i think it was analytic philosophy in</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.840" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">particular and i have similar misgivings</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:22.319" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that a current</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.319" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">understanding of philosophy as it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:28.480" style="s2">institutionalized is a very accurate</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">conception of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.480" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">the philosophical life was and really</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:34.480" style="s2">ought to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">yeah in fact i you know i quote i</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.480" end="00:03:37.519" style="s2">paraphrased wittgenstein original early</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">wittgenstein</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.519" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">and i basically say uh modern philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">is a long journey to nowhere right</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">yeah i mean i&#39;m sure i&#39;m sure there&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:48.080" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">i&#39;m sure there are some exceptions to</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.080" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">that rule but generally speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">um both continental and analytic</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:04:00.480" style="s2">that is those undertaken in europe</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.040" end="00:04:03.519" style="s2">and in anglo-america</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.480" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">seem to be involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.519" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">kinds of discourses that don&#39;t often</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">appeal to ordinary persons who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">really grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">meaning questions of meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:15.479" style="s2">and value</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">that&#39;s the the great trouble with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.479" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">institutionalization of philosophy as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:21.519" style="s2">comes about in the 18th and 19th</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:24.080" style="s2">centuries in germany</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.519" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">and afterward the united states so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.080" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">suffice to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:29.040" style="s2">what i&#39;m up to is a fairly obvious thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">to do to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.040" end="00:04:32.479" style="s2">it we need to ask those questions and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">need to answer them</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.479" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">particularly at this moment in time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">philosophy has just been one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.600" style="s2">deepest</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">activities involved in those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.600" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">inquiries</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.680" style="s2">yep and even when i uh find it goes</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">nowhere nonetheless find it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.680" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">in the last few weeks i&#39;ve been digging</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">into heidegger oh for instance yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">uh yeah and uh you know heidegger is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.960" style="s2">little different because he also</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">uh talks about having to ground it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.960" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">everyday</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:01.280" style="s2">life and all but he goes off to the wild</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">blue yonder and all kinds of crazy ass</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.280" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2"> but nonetheless it&#39;s stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">stimulating to think about and so i do</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">encourage people to read modern</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:10.000" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">even at the end of the day you believe</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.000" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">it&#39;s uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">fireworks and jerking off mesa uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:16.639" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:19.039" style="s2">because it will make you think a little</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.639" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">bit and that&#39;s not a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.039" end="00:05:24.639" style="s2">no they&#39;re they&#39;re i&#39;m enjoying this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">conversation already</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.639" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">but um and there are philosophers who</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">able to help you do more than jerk off</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:35.199" style="s2">so there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.400" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">people like pierre doe who died in 2010</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.199" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">and he did argue very convincingly</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:40.960" style="s2">things that ancient greek philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.960" style="s2">involved with</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.960" end="00:05:45.039" style="s2">the questions of the good life there are</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.960" end="00:05:46.160" style="s2">others like him as well even jm cooper</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:48.160" style="s2">wrote a wonderful book called the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.160" end="00:05:50.720" style="s2">pursuits of wisdom where he discusses</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.160" end="00:05:52.960" style="s2">epicureanism and stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.720" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">and platonism and so on in ways that i</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.960" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">think would be very</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">helpful for people living today yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:05:59.400" style="s2">certainly there&#39;s been this very</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.400" end="00:06:04.240" style="s2">neo-stoicism that&#39;s uh arisen of late</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">i&#39;d happen to know a couple of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.240" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">figures in that field doesn&#39;t appeal to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">me in the slightest but</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">uh uh you know i can see why uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">people would find it helpful and uh it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:17.039" style="s2">seems to be a good thing not a bad thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">just a matter of taste that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.039" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">appeal to my particular personality</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">i&#39;m much more of an epicurean than i am</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">a stoicist i would say</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">i like the good life right uh you know i</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.639" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">feel like uh you know sort of being</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">quiet and modest or whatever i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">get out there and knock it around and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">do little this and that and uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:44.400" style="s2">have good time with my friends and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">uh you know and think deeply right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.400" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">uh so yeah i would call it stylistically</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">uh a more of an epicurean than a than a</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">stoic</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:54.240" style="s2">uh though uh you know philosophically i</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:56.479" style="s2">can find</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.240" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">useful things in both traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.479" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">again those who listen to the show know</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.080" style="s2">my one watch word which i apply to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:05.440" style="s2">everything the lens</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:08.400" style="s2">is is it useful right i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:10.160" style="s2">anything a priori i tend to be skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.400" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">of ideologies and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.160" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">uh certainly revealed religions but i</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">can use the lend is it useful on almost</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">yeah well if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">philosophy as the loving pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">wisdom or loving pursuit of living a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">wise life then</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">i would argue that it couldn&#39;t be any</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">more useful exactly it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">we forgot the more basic or</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">all-encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">use of the word usefulness i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">that&#39;s a good point</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">well let&#39;s dive into the focus of this</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">current episode which is the medium</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:44.960" style="s2">article you wrote the uninvited</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">confession</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:49.440" style="s2">the new confessional and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">start off with a brief quote</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.440" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">uh over the years and most especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">during the coronavirus i&#39;ve noticed an</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">unsettling trend people i barely know or</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:07:59.360" style="s2">do not know it all will send me letters</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">written in a mode of a confession</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.360" end="00:08:03.599" style="s2">completely out of the blue the writer</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">will not ask after me or mine nor at</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.599" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:07.840" style="s2">he or she in any way include me and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:09.120" style="s2">time was used to be termed a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.840" end="00:08:11.919" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.120" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">instead the writer spills spilling guts</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.919" end="00:08:16.639" style="s2">onto the page will speak</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:17.919" style="s2">at me uh you know and then you go on to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.639" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">talk about how this</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.919" end="00:08:21.919" style="s2">uh is uh in your view very much related</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.919" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">uh i guess you might call it the uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">psychotherapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:30.319" style="s2">culture uh what do you what do you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">to say about that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.319" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a big it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">a very important and big</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:37.839" style="s2">question i i want to say something first</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:41.360" style="s2">by way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.839" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">by by way background so um</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.360" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">in 2017 uh i began to notice</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:49.440" style="s2">that people were talking at great length</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.600" style="s2">about work</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.440" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">and i think you&#39;ve read a couple of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.600" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">pieces about the nature of work today</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.120" style="s2">and so i i did have a kind of gestalt</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">shift or</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.120" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">a moment where things clicked and i</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:02.240" style="s2">began to realize that joseph peeper who</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:03.839" style="s2">was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.240" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">german philosopher writing in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.839" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">century was on to something when he</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">spoke about</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">the nature of total work and the ways in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.240" style="s2">which human beings become</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">workers so i would call that the homo</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.240" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">economicus conception</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">now more recently i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:25.360" style="s2">homo that is how it was possible</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">also for human beings to come to think</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.360" end="00:09:29.120" style="s2">of themselves in deeply psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">terms</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.120" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">so that&#39;s more or less the backdrop to</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">this particular piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">i mean there are a number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">sociologists writing in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">many of whom have begun to point to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">topic i&#39;m discussing today so philip</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">reef wrote a book in 1965 or so called</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">the triumph of therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">and began to point to the fact that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">lot of people i noticed were starting to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">become interested in</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:59.200" style="s2">feeling good that was the good life you</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:10:00.880" style="s2">might say was the life of feeling good</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.200" end="00:10:03.920" style="s2">but more recently i think what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.880" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">quite astonishing about</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.920" end="00:10:07.440" style="s2">homo psychologicos is that we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">a ramping up</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.440" end="00:10:15.360" style="s2">of this interior psychological</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">dispensation or dimension in life</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.360" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">and so i&#39;ll just give you one particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:23.680" style="s2">understanding so there&#39;s something i</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">call secular spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.680" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">that refers to going north of what ken</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">wilber calls the flatland</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">of our current culture but it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">south</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">of transcendence so in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">no-man&#39;s land</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">you begin to notice people talking at</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">great length about their interior states</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:44.880" style="s2">about certain sets of experiences they</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">have about certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.880" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">growth experiences and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">so i&#39;m beginning to pick up on the ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">in which there is no such idea as a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a very little sense of a common</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">good or publicness</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s a great turn toward interior</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:08.000" style="s2">that are then going to be discussed</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">at a considerable length on instagram</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.000" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">via twitter and for me via email</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">yeah i certainly resonate with you</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">talking about there i grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">working</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">working class area where uh nobody went</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">to therapy</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:23.680" style="s2">right unless they were by court order or</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">you know a case of a real tragedy i</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.680" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">remember a mother whose young child</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">died in a swimming accident drowned</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">right i think she went to therapy</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">but therapy was not a thing right and i</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:33.839" style="s2">went to college in massachusetts and</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">cambridge</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.839" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">and then i i also then moved back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:39.360" style="s2">cambridge later and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">started two companies and i came to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.360" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">realize there was this huge industry of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">what i came to call</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">recreational therapy uh and uh what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:48.880" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:50.079" style="s2">right what are all these people doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.880" end="00:11:52.800" style="s2">and i will</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">say to this day it has kind of astounded</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.800" end="00:11:55.760" style="s2">me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not not something i&#39;ve ever really</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.760" end="00:12:01.200" style="s2">uh you know got involved with uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.560" end="00:12:02.880" style="s2">it just struck struck me as an oddity of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.200" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">the modern world but as you point out</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.880" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">the discourse of uh what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">the depth psychologists in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">permeates our culture especially our</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.399" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">certainly our literary fiction a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:17.600" style="s2">our movies a lot of our sitcoms etc</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">uh it really is uh you know quite a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.600" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">fundamental part of the memetic</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">in fact i had a really interesting</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:28.320" style="s2">scientists on the show a couple of weeks</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.320" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">it was nick chater whose book the mind</p>

<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">of depth psychology and the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.160" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">there really is some true</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">depth uh to our personalities and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">you know in</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">rather what we&#39;re doing is reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">combination of perception and memory and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">confabulation confabulating on the fly</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:57.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">it seems seems relatively convincing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.360" end="00:13:01.839" style="s2">certainly uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:05.760" style="s2">uh we know that uh freud and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.839" end="00:13:07.120" style="s2">you know his uh heirs and assigns like</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.760" end="00:13:09.200" style="s2">young etc</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.120" end="00:13:11.120" style="s2">uh aren&#39;t really scientists uh i would</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.200" end="00:13:12.399" style="s2">call them closer to litterists you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.120" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">literary people</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.399" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">you know they write some write some</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">things that we resonate with right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">kind of strike us as yes that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.279" style="s2">what being a human is like in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">but when it actually puts it a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.279" end="00:13:26.079" style="s2">scientific test not so much</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">so anyway yeah that&#39;s my reaction to</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.079" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">this uh psychotherapeutic culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:35.040" style="s2">and uh uh yeah it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:36.320" style="s2">it is a really big part of the current</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.040" end="00:13:38.079" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.320" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">yeah so maybe i can provide a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.079" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">way of contextualizing why i actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:44.399" style="s2">care about it now</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:46.399" style="s2">i think two things tend to be lost or</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.399" end="00:13:49.120" style="s2">foreclosed at this moment in time</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.399" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">one is a deep conception of the vita</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.120" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">vita contemplativa that is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">contemplative life</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">and this was the life of contemplation</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">was extraordinarily important in ancient</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">greece going all the way through the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">end of the early modern period in europe</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">it was really holding sway</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">so the life of contemplating ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">goods or ultimate things</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">was of fundamental importance and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">not even remotely</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">part of the current landscape that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">see today but i think it&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:24.800" style="s2">part of what it is to be human so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">the first one i see that has been gone</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.800" end="00:14:28.560" style="s2">by the wayside largely so</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">the second one though is was really</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.560" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">pointed out by a number of sociologists</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">throughout the course of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:35.120" style="s2">century and they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:36.399" style="s2">they were trying to draw our attention</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.120" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.399" end="00:14:39.440" style="s2">notions of the common good to use</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.440" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">to mystic language were dissolving</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">and so if we ask ourselves what has</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.959" style="s2">happened instead to</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">to fill this void the void of the lack</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.959" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">of contemplation and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:55.600" style="s2">lack of genuine public spiritedness a</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">genuine sense of the common good</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.600" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">i would suggest this very strange notion</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">of interiority</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">the long</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.240" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">micro inspection of certain interior</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">that will then be put in the form of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:16.240" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">and shared as if they were open secrets</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.240" end="00:15:20.240" style="s2">they&#39;re open secrets on instagram but</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.519" style="s2">then they become slightly more secretive</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.240" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">when it&#39;s actually in the confessional</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.519" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">mode in a one-on-one sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">so i can probably try to ground what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">saying in a very specific example</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:32.000" style="s2">that i only allude to in that particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.000" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">a couple months ago i was introduced to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:38.079" style="s2">a man with whom i might</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">philosophize and i just said let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">call the man john</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:42.399" style="s2">and so i said let&#39;s just have a chat</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">john and this is what i typically do</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.399" end="00:15:45.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">have an ordinary conversation without</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:49.199" style="s2">any kind of expectations</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">just to get a feel for him and for him</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.199" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">to get a feel for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">it was very striking about this</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">this this i guess monologue really was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">that was precisely that but he was</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">monologuing</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">he he began really by telling me that he</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">had all these things going on and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:08.000" style="s2">felt as if he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">i felt as though i was the therapist</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.000" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">right i was put</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">in the position of the therapist and he</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.839" style="s2">was the one who was</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">the client or an alazand</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.839" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">and he was telling me three topics and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">above all he was</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">suggesting that what really mattered to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">him is that he didn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:27.120" style="s2">understood or recognized and i could i</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">got the sense that this was a very well</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.120" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">grooved story</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.959" style="s2">he told it over and over again over many</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">years i&#39;d say the man was probably based</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.959" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">on the tone of his voice only maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.040" style="s2">his mid 50s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:40.079" style="s2">early 60s and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.040" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">extraordinarily uncanny to me</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.079" end="00:16:44.639" style="s2">and so when i asked him uh what what</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:46.399" style="s2">would you like to know about me</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.639" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">since this is a ostensibly a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.399" end="00:16:50.000" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:52.320" style="s2">he said well the only thing i&#39;d really</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.000" end="00:16:53.920" style="s2">like to know is whether or not you heard</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.320" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">what i had to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.920" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">so that&#39;s what um therapy would call</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:00.639" style="s2">mirroring so i mirrored it back to him</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">given and that&#39;s what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.639" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">that particular tet attempt</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">but not without feeling a great sense of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:08.000" style="s2">disease about the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:09.120" style="s2">so it was a kind of click a moment when</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.000" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">things clicked</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.120" end="00:17:13.439" style="s2">i saw this person was not alone i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.360" end="00:17:15.120" style="s2">conversations like this before</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.439" end="00:17:17.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve had exchanges like this before in</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.120" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">the past and i&#39;ve wanted to see whether</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.280" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:24.720" style="s2">more to seeing these as particular signs</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:26.319" style="s2">of the state of culture today at least</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.720" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">among those who are let&#39;s say elites</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.319" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">living in the east coast the united</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">states but i think also in other</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">places like san francisco and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">yeah i think uh i think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">interesting insight actually and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:42.240" style="s2">uh you know i would say uh definitely</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:44.320" style="s2">uh that you know people as you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.240" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at these what they think</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.320" end="00:17:50.880" style="s2">are depths right they&#39;re dwelling on</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:52.799" style="s2">uh neuro neurological phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.880" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">which you can there certainly are</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.799" end="00:17:56.240" style="s2">interesting uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:57.600" style="s2">uh neurological phenomena and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.240" end="00:18:01.039" style="s2">mistaking them for</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.600" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">something uh well they&#39;re real to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.039" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">that they&#39;re not real is not true</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:06.640" style="s2">but the claim that they have deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">metaphysical significance right</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.640" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">and and you know this is what uh people</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">like john vervicky</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">talk about the meaning crisis when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.880" style="s2">know nietzsche and the enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:19.679" style="s2">overthrew the traditional gods</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.880" end="00:18:20.559" style="s2">uh rather than uh just dealing with that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.679" end="00:18:22.720" style="s2">and moving on</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">an awful lot of people continue to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.720" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">searching for surrogates and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">various shallow forms of spirituality as</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:33.120" style="s2">people call it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:33.679" style="s2">uh you know seem to be uh filling that</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.120" end="00:18:36.799" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.679" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">and the psychotherapeutic uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.799" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">hobby uh seems similar</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">yeah it i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.200" style="s2">but let&#39;s let&#39;s even investigate what</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:50.080" style="s2">what seems to be missing here</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.200" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">so those who have gotten very much</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.080" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">in this hobby are missing a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:56.799" style="s2">what it is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">to be involved in a good human life so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.799" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re not cultivating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">virtues that aristotle would associate</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">with friendship or what he called philia</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">that is caring for another person for</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">his or her own sake</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">that&#39;s an extraordinarily important</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:14.400" style="s2">feature of a good life i would say</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">but nor are they involved in let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.400" end="00:19:18.480" style="s2">volunteer activities</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">or what christians would call karitas</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">which is a forms of charity</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.320" style="s2">uh ways of engaging other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">less off than we are that&#39;s another one</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.320" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">a part of the american tradition at</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.679" style="s2">least during the 19th century surely</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">and and most important for me since i am</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">a zen buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">they&#39;re not as well as a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:41.360" style="s2">that kind of loop that they&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:43.200" style="s2">in is not enabling them to go</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.360" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">beyond the circle of their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.200" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">so i azam buddhist doesn&#39;t care too much</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">about the content</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">of mentation that is whatever comes to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:54.960" style="s2">mind is whatever comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">but the suggestion is that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.960" end="00:19:59.600" style="s2">actually are forms of life</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:02.080" style="s2">or ways of being that are beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.600" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">contents of your thoughts and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.080" end="00:20:08.480" style="s2">and if you particularly devote your life</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">to looking at the contents of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.480" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">and feelings over and over again then</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">you&#39;re really missing</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:15.919" style="s2">um what we say you&#39;re missing the forest</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">for the trees</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.919" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">yeah i like that a lot uh the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">thing i liked a lot in your essay</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">is that you connected that perspective</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">to narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.760" style="s2">and and you know there&#39;s been been quite</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">some time that</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.760" end="00:20:32.000" style="s2">people have been pointing out that we</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">are developing a culture of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.000" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">at a exceptionally high level and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">you know this this phenomenon that</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about strikes me as</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:42.080" style="s2">uh an almost pure form of narcissism you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:44.799" style="s2">know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.080" end="00:20:45.600" style="s2">you know my my little internal thingies</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.799" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.600" end="00:20:50.559" style="s2">uh you know are more important than you</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:53.039" style="s2">know my relationships with my family or</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.559" end="00:20:55.520" style="s2">my friends or my community or</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.039" end="00:20:57.679" style="s2">or doing good works or uh one that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.520" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">notice has fallen off tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.679" end="00:21:03.760" style="s2">uh is conviviality the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">you know really having uh deep</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.760" end="00:21:10.559" style="s2">live personal entertainment with</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:12.799" style="s2">friends rather than you know looking you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.559" end="00:21:16.400" style="s2">know going out to some canned concert</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.799" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">or uh or what have you so yeah i would</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.400" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">i would love to hear your your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:25.039" style="s2">on how uh the culture of narcissism</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">is uh interacting with these phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.039" end="00:21:30.320" style="s2">right um i think it would be helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">put in context the the therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.320" end="00:21:33.280" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m still in the early stages of my</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.280" end="00:21:38.640" style="s2">investigation so this is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">free willing here but let&#39;s consider the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.640" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">what let&#39;s say carl pelenia writes in</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:46.080" style="s2">his book the great transformation</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">as it pertains to the movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.080" end="00:21:49.280" style="s2">over the course of capitalism from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">countryside to the city</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">so we can&#39;t we can&#39;t deny that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:56.159" style="s2">urbanization has been a remarkable force</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:57.679" style="s2">at this moment in time as mega cities</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.159" end="00:21:59.600" style="s2">have been created</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.679" end="00:22:00.960" style="s2">and as young people continue to flock to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.600" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">mega cities for</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.960" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">the purposes of career development and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">making their way in the world and such</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s at least one strand in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">argument so you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.840" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">deracinated individuals moving from</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">small town wisconsin where i grew up to</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">new york city</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">and it happens also in denmark where</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve spoken with people over the years</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:23.679" style="s2">as it does in england as people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">moving to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.679" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">london i mean the fact that you have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:31.200" style="s2">self-possessive individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">on his or her own in the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.200" end="00:22:34.799" style="s2">alienated</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">modern landscape is already suggestive</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.799" end="00:22:40.000" style="s2">of someone who has broken ties to family</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:42.400" style="s2">and to local communities</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.000" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">as part of the bargain for trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.400" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">make his or her way in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s one strand that can help us</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">narcissism could have arisen but then i</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.640" style="s2">think we also have</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.720" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">are those who are only useful to you</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">other cases you just have</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:32.159" style="s2">so you start to notice the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">narcissism could arose it&#39;s i&#39;m telling</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.159" end="00:24:36.799" style="s2">something like right now a subtraction</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">story take away the sorts of of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.799" end="00:24:39.279" style="s2">fundamental connections we have with</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.279" end="00:24:43.360" style="s2">and see what you&#39;re left with well</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">you&#39;re left with someone who more and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.360" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">more is involved</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">in beginning to in a fairly neurotic way</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">look at or examine the contents of his</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:54.559" style="s2">or her own consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">and then i would argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.559" end="00:24:59.679" style="s2">workplace has also begun to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.880" style="s2">reveal a lot of these marks as well so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.679" end="00:25:02.559" style="s2">it&#39;s only in recent years that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.880" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">heard talk about vulnerabilities</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.559" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">being shared and and facilitation</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:10.799" style="s2">workshops being undertaken at various</p>

<p begin="00:25:10.799" end="00:25:16.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s also being encouraged for one to</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.919" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">be engaged in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.320" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">looping around inquiry into one&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:22.240" style="s2">states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s not surprising then and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.240" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">think i have all the strands</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">of the story woven together yet that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">begin to see more and more narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:32.159" style="s2">people emerging</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">in this context yeah indeed and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.159" end="00:25:35.840" style="s2">i&#39;m involved with something called the</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">game b movement which is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.840" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">build a more</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">authentic uh way of being and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">things that we&#39;ve talked about and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">think we put the date about 1925</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">is that the amount of personal</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:50.640" style="s2">investment we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:51.600" style="s2">we have in family and face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.640" end="00:25:54.240" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.600" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">has declined since 1925 more or less</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.240" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">continuously</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">and what&#39;s taken its place has been the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:00.320" style="s2">market and government</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:02.320" style="s2">and you know both of those are uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.320" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">essentially uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.320" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">abstract cold interfaces while the</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">family and the face-to-face community</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.120" style="s2">are warm and complex and very high</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.120" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s just a very different way</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">to live</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">and uh part of our prescription of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:22.000" style="s2">way forward is we call proto-b&#39;s which</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:24.480" style="s2">is to develop</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.000" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">communities where we that take good care</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.480" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">of families because</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">families are the basis of everything</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:32.880" style="s2">when we let our families go to hell</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:34.960" style="s2">uh starting in the uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.880" end="00:26:35.919" style="s2">world war ii but really accelerating in</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.960" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">the uh</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.919" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">late 60s and early 70s you know people</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">now become fractionated and no longer</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">connected in a matrix</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">of you know biological and emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">obligation</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.760" style="s2">and you know the way forward seems to us</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">to be to rebuild</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.760" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">communities such that the families at</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:54.960" style="s2">the base and then the face-to-face</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.679" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.960" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">supports and helps the family create the</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">who help make an even better community</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">support the family and</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s really what uh what comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">next should be about not even more</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">fractionation and more alienation of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:17.200" style="s2">uh you know radically displaced</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:18.399" style="s2">individual i agree</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.200" end="00:27:20.880" style="s2">it&#39;s funny is that what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.399" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">describing in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.880" end="00:27:28.320" style="s2">tracks what al-stair mcintyre calls</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">revolutionary aristotelianism which is</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">which might strike some of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:33.679" style="s2">listeners is a bit amusing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">because he&#39;s really just referring to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.679" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">more or less what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:39.440" style="s2">face-to-face community centered on the</p>

<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:50.799" style="s2">it&#39;s just a small scale community you</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">can find it in certain eco villages or</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.799" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">in certain tension communities at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">in principle not in practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s one of the reasons i</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">live in very remote virginia</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:01.919" style="s2">uh you know the nearest grocery store is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">an hour&#39;s drive over three mountain</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.919" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">ranges</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">but we have an intact community here</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:09.520" style="s2">real people who can really rely upon</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.600" style="s2">uh you know and you can get really get</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.520" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">to know over a period of years</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.600" end="00:28:15.200" style="s2">and you know i you know i frankly can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:18.399" style="s2">can&#39;t even imagine</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">being that uh nomad that i used to be</p>

<p begin="00:31:40.480" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">just is nuts from my perspective and yet</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.880" end="00:31:46.399" style="s2">the world seems to think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">fine and dandy i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.399" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">distinguish i&#39;m sympathetic to what you</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">say i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">distinguish between a subjective</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">if you so i&#39;ll give you one example</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.200" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">a number of people will get asked via a</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">pew poll</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.279" end="00:32:16.399" style="s2">and it depends on the poll and some will</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.000" style="s2">say no one let&#39;s say yes but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.399" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">by my lights this is a really poor</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.000" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">question on the whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">because i&#39;m more or less skeptical of of</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">that arises at the end of the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.240" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">century and really pick some steam</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">throughout the course of the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.360" end="00:32:32.720" style="s2">i provide this as one example just to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:35.039" style="s2">illustrate the limitations</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.720" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">of polling when you have people the same</p>

<p begin="00:32:39.679" end="00:32:46.240" style="s2">i would suggest that sure people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">let&#39;s say subjectively content with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.240" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">status quo</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:55.039" style="s2">only in so far as in a fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">they know no other right i mean the key</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:59.679" style="s2">to living today</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.159" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">is in fact the the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.679" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">options in terms of a marketplace to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:06.159" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">that&#39;s true but the lack of genuine</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">as it pertains to how to live in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">a broader sense so we&#39;ve basically</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.480" style="s2">agreed</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.760" end="00:33:17.519" style="s2">that the modern liberal state is</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">i&#39;m skeptical of the entire model as i</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">think you are when it comes to game view</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">so polling is simply not going to do</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:46.000" style="s2">much i think</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">when it comes to actually interrogating</p>

<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">the kind that i tend to have daily such</p>

<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">they would play the role of the answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">and i would play the role of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:26.079" style="s2">i think it wouldn&#39;t be hard to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.839" end="00:36:29.359" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.079" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">more more basic at play here</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.359" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">that&#39;s something we haven&#39;t touched upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">yet and that would be something like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:36.079" style="s2">following i actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">am feeling dis-ease in the buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.079" end="00:36:42.240" style="s2">sense some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:44.880" style="s2">life being rather off or disconcerting</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.240" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">or not quite what it&#39;s supposed to be or</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.880" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">as i like to i like the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:50.640" style="s2">gloss the pali term dukkha meaning uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">things aren&#39;t spot on</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.640" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">really so that&#39;s what i think the person</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">would would say as much now the person</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t confess as much the person</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">would actually be involved in speaking</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.560" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">the truth i think the other</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">important point that person would make</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">is effectively this i&#39;m i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:08.079" style="s2">quite lonely</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:10.000" style="s2">existentially so if you could begin from</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.079" end="00:37:12.480" style="s2">that starting point namely</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.000" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">i&#39;m actually discontent notwithstanding</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.480" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">the ways in which i proclaim in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">that i am content and i&#39;m actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">lonely or lonesome notwithstanding the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:28.400" style="s2">i appear for all intents and purposes</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:29.280" style="s2">among my cohort to be gregarious</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.400" end="00:37:31.839" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">then you can begin to get some purchase</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.839" end="00:37:33.920" style="s2">on how that person might be different</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.920" end="00:37:38.079" style="s2">how collective life might be different</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:39.599" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s that&#39;s correct i</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.079" end="00:37:43.760" style="s2">mean certainly we know from</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">even from tracking polls that uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.760" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">you know loneliness is perceived</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">loneliness is definitely on the upswing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.560" style="s2">and the number of actual deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">friendships that people have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.560" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">surprising number of people now have</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">zero which is to my mind uh staggering</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">disastrous right uh people being a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">friend that you could have a truly deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">conversation about something of great</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">right i like the old saying you know a</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">friend will help you move</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:12.720" style="s2">a good friend will help you move a body</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.720" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">so so how many good friends do you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">i got about 10</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">right i think i&#39;m damn lucky to have</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">that many right</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">uh but there are people who have zero</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">that would have to be a very strange way</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.160" style="s2">to live</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">and then another another you know form</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.160" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">of what you&#39;re talking about that does</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:30.560" style="s2">come through from the polling is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">famous question are we on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">is the country on the right track or the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:36.320" style="s2">wrong track</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:38.560" style="s2">i just pulled it up uh the consensus on</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.320" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">real clear politics and this has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.560" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">uh consistent for years it&#39;s about 65</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">percent of people believe the country is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:46.480" style="s2">on the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:48.240" style="s2">track and and that&#39;s you know kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.480" end="00:38:48.800" style="s2">reification a lot of these things</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.240" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.800" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">deep down inside people know this ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">the right way to live this is not the</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s interesting it would</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">be actually i don&#39;t really get the data</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">uh do a calculation</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">uh of therapists per capita by county or</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">something probably the labor department</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">statistics might actually have</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">at least some rough and crude things and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">see what that shows sure</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:48.160" style="s2">i bet that would be interesting and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">correlate it with things like</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.160" end="00:40:52.240" style="s2">uh population density number of people</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:55.440" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.240" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">uh still working the land uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.440" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">etc uh i&#39;m gonna do that just for fun</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">i i mean yeah yeah i mean i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:06.160" style="s2">you have the poet wendell berry</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">living in rural kentucky uh going once</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.160" end="00:41:10.480" style="s2">weekly</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">to a therapist nearby so</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.480" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t think so yeah wendell berry</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:15.920" style="s2">i mean he&#39;s an amazing example</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">he actually was the commencement speaker</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.920" end="00:41:19.440" style="s2">when my wife</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">graduated from college at a small</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.440" end="00:41:22.640" style="s2">liberal arts college in kentucky and we</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">got the chance to chat with him</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.640" end="00:41:26.400" style="s2">afterwards quite a</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">quite a fine human being that was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.400" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">zillion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:34.720" style="s2">yeah yeah he&#39;s lovely so i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting so what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.720" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">god damn it you know the pro the game b</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:41.839" style="s2">answer is to literally start building on</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">the ground communities that exemplify</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.839" end="00:41:46.000" style="s2">uh some of these ideas but of course at</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">least in the short run they don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.000" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">scale if we did a great job maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">build a hundred of them in the next</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:54.160" style="s2">10 years and that would be home for</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">maybe 15 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.160" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">that of course is like spitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:00.640" style="s2">ocean</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">what ideas do you have to you know help</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.640" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">people live more authentic</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">uh more grounded more real uh just</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:10.640" style="s2">better lives the good life how can we do</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">that at scale</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.640" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i i don&#39;t have great</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">proposals here but i have a starting</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">so this starting point would be a joke</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:21.839" style="s2">it would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:23.440" style="s2">never let a good crisis go to waste so i</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.839" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">think you&#39;d need to begin with a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.440" end="00:42:26.720" style="s2">kind of collective crisis</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.359" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">you find in a number of different</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">traditions that and i found in my own</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">time of philosophizing with individuals</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:38.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:38.880" style="s2">at a point at which a current way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.400" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.880" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">no longer makes sense and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:45.440" style="s2">understood very intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">very invisibly then you have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.440" end="00:42:50.079" style="s2">beginning of a new possibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:51.599" style="s2">so if you could begin to imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.079" end="00:42:53.599" style="s2">number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.599" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">have been living according to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.599" end="00:42:56.839" style="s2">dictates of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">certain narcissistic narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.839" end="00:43:01.599" style="s2">tendencies and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">more and more of them aren&#39;t just living</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.599" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">through coed</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">but something dare i say</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">more existentially potent than covid</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">then you have the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">possibility of what i call a collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:18.560" style="s2">existential opening i think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">first step you really can&#39;t pull people</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.560" end="00:43:21.599" style="s2">out of systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">as they are and expect that they will be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.599" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">ready because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:26.480" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually ripe for it you</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:28.319" style="s2">don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.480" end="00:43:30.319" style="s2">for example have someone come and sit at</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">a sashim which is a zen buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">intensive meditation retreat for seven</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">days it&#39;s a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:37.520" style="s2">you only begin with someone who has been</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">as buddhist would say</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.520" end="00:43:40.880" style="s2">open to the great matter of life and</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.880" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">so this is the first part you&#39;re there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.720" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">you know you the the the joke might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">no scale without collective existential</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:50.400" style="s2">opening</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">so yeah well we certainly we have that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.400" end="00:43:56.079" style="s2">in the game b world what we say</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">is that that we need ears to hear</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.079" end="00:44:01.440" style="s2">and our hypothesis is the current</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">accelerated metacrisis of 2020 have at</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.440" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">least</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">increased the number of year years to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">here by a factor of 10x</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.240" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">as opposed to uh january 1st and uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:13.359" style="s2">you know we do intend to take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">of that and i i think that&#39;s uh that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.359" end="00:44:16.160" style="s2">good insight</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:17.520" style="s2">yeah so the second point i would make is</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.160" end="00:44:19.839" style="s2">that they&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.520" end="00:44:20.720" style="s2">in keeping with what you were just</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.839" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.720" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">is there&#39;s a is that there&#39;s a kairos or</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">timing issue</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve noticed that people only tend to</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">open up</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">at a particular moment and the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">aperture</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">so to speak is only open so long before</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:39.520" style="s2">they tend to return to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">the ways that they had been living so</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.520" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that you need to have as</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">jesus said</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:46.480" style="s2">ears to hear you also need for people to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.480" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">encountered right at the point at which</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">things don&#39;t make sense to them socrates</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.040" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">calls it opera</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">right the sense of confusion sense of</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">being turned about</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:01.680" style="s2">if you can get those right that you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">have the beginning of a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.680" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">movement or a genuine shift in</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">yeah i think i think that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">you know one you know just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:13.200" style="s2">about this out loud as you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:15.520" style="s2">yeah uh uh one that strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">as where the rubber meets the road for</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.520" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">is the uh amazingly</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.839" style="s2">chaotic state of public school education</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.720" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.839" end="00:45:28.880" style="s2">i mean this is kind of like business</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">travel</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.880" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">it strikes me that business travel will</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">never return anything like</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:36.720" style="s2">it used to be i mean the the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:38.480" style="s2">to do it a different way people realize</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.720" end="00:45:40.000" style="s2">do i really need to spend uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.480" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">you know three thousand dollars to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.000" end="00:45:42.240" style="s2">out to california for two days for one</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:45.280" style="s2">meeting</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.240" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">hell though right uh and i think this</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.280" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">crisis of public school education is</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">making clear to people</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">uh that the whole idea of the current</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">public school education is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">fairly much a nightmare of uh large</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">proportions</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">and uh opening around a better way</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">to raise your children including you</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">know organic education built right into</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">the way of life</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">may be an opening to millions of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:13.760" style="s2">right now who really are</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:15.680" style="s2">in crisis and and even the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.760" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">don&#39;t yet realize they&#39;re in crisis are</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.680" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">gonna realize it in a year when they</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">realize that most of their kids didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">learn jack in the last 12 months</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:25.040" style="s2">at least not uh uh you know not what</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">they thought they were supposed to learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.040" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a good point of leverage i&#39;ve as</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">you&#39;ve already gathered i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:31.359" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.839" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">our notions of work because i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.359" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s another very</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:40.160" style="s2">low-hanging fruit so kovid certainly has</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">brought mass unemployment to millions of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.160" end="00:46:42.640" style="s2">americans</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">now a number of them are receiving</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.640" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">unemployment benefits right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:48.319" style="s2">and a number of them will be funneled</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:50.160" style="s2">back into the system</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.160" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">moreover a number of people are</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">learning new neologisms such as work</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">from home or working remotely</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:46:59.760" style="s2">for a while that&#39;s their attention is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">going to be sequestered they&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.760" end="00:47:02.319" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have to live in the bay</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">area they can live in denver</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.319" end="00:47:05.920" style="s2">or they can live somewhere around the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">country so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.920" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">they&#39;re starting to inquire but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:13.119" style="s2">inquiry hasn&#39;t gone</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">very deep yet so if it were possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.119" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">actually to show that the ways we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:18.079" style="s2">of working</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:19.200" style="s2">are fundamentally untenable i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.079" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">argue</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.200" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">then we also have another leverage point</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">because our gainful employment system</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">is already hooked up to our public comp</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:34.800" style="s2">or our public education system</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">right as it is as it&#39;s linked up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.800" end="00:47:37.680" style="s2">other systems too so you really just</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.680" end="00:47:42.720" style="s2">put pressure on one system so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">through a level of thoughtfulness you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.720" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">can begin to show people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">these are concatenated</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re linked to each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:52.079" style="s2">right so a number of parents for example</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">i hear from are</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.079" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">are annoyed by the fact that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">tired of having johnny or susie at home</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.400" end="00:48:00.319" style="s2">because they&#39;re it&#39;s a dual income</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:02.000" style="s2">household and so then now they need to</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.319" end="00:48:03.839" style="s2">do babysitting and as you well know</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.000" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">public schooling apart from other things</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.839" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">is a is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">of having babysitting for eight hours a</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:11.119" style="s2">day or so</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:12.079" style="s2">so they&#39;re starting to feel the pinch</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.119" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">but they haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.079" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">analyzed yet the fact that it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">gainful employment system</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">of which they have been willing</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.680" style="s2">participants that&#39;s allowing them to</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">actually not acknowledge the extent to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.680" end="00:48:26.480" style="s2">which they&#39;re feeling the pinch</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">yep and and i think the other key part</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.480" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">which take the next step from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">is most people can&#39;t synthesize the</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">but they have but if they see one they</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:38.079" style="s2">can recognize it right</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:39.599" style="s2">uh you know for instance in our game b</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.079" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">proto-b concept</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.599" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">uh the idea of babysitting is actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:45.440" style="s2">fully organic right it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.440" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">uh and one of the areas that we i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">been researching in particular</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:52.960" style="s2">uh for ideas for proto-b&#39;s are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.760" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">israeli kibbutz</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.960" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">right in the israeli kibbutz there there</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:59.280" style="s2">was no arrangement you had to make for</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:00.400" style="s2">daycare it was built into the social</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.280" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">operating system</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.400" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">that there were a group of folks whose</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">job it was to take care of kids while</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">their parents did other things whether</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">arts or make love or what have you</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.040" style="s2">and there was no hassle it didn&#39;t cost</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:14.319" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.040" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">and it was just part of the social</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:17.359" style="s2">operating system now there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">parts of how the kibbutz operated that i</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.359" end="00:49:19.599" style="s2">would disagree with but i thought that</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.599" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">uh something that would very much</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.839" end="00:49:25.359" style="s2">resonate particularly with young</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">millennial parents today</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.359" end="00:49:28.880" style="s2">uh is that uh you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:32.640" style="s2">nightmarish</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.880" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">difficulty of having your kids</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.640" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">watched over by the whole community</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:39.520" style="s2">basically which</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.760" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">no longer exists would be a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.520" end="00:49:43.760" style="s2">liberating phenomena for the person</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">themselves and would be amazingly good</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.760" end="00:49:49.040" style="s2">for the children as well and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:50.880" style="s2">if we could build a social operating</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.040" end="00:49:52.319" style="s2">system even at a small scale and be able</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.880" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">to show people come visit</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.319" end="00:49:57.200" style="s2">see how the kids are just there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">essentially supervised by all the adults</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.200" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.680" style="s2">uh and uh there are a few professionals</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:02.880" style="s2">who make sure things don&#39;t spin out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.680" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.880" end="00:50:07.520" style="s2">but you don&#39;t have to uh you know spend</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">uh 30 percent of your income on</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.520" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">uh on on child care that&#39;s nuts right</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">and and then which then allows you not</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">to have to have such an intense</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">pursuit of the almighty dollar and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">know but i think showing is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">uh real</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">important yes and on</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">on the other end of of life</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:29.839" style="s2">the hope would be that we begin to</p>

<p begin="00:54:57.200" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">not a bad idea the reason i brought the</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">topic up</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">in keeping with how to raise children is</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">that in the philosophical tradition</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">these have all been questions of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:11.760" style="s2">good life and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">i i just look around for the areas in</p>

<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:17.760" style="s2">where we are not yet</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.760" end="00:55:23.760" style="s2">of not yet being open to examining them</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.720" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">it turns out that we are held fast</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.760" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">by our delusions and by our</p>

<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">so this is why it&#39;s it&#39;s so remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.839" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">to me that people will</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">raise children so that they can become</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">you know that suicide is a mortal sin</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">and so we&#39;re also polluted with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">that kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:26.240" style="s2">well i mean i think what&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">you&#39;re probably a card-carrying</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.240" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">secularist but</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">what can be said about about secularism</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:32.640" style="s2">is that it actually imports</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">a lot of the assumptions from</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.640" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">christianity without actually owning up</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">to those assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:40.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s certainly possible they have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:41.839" style="s2">number of secular people who can&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.079" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">go of the grandparents but they have no</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.839" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">idea why they can&#39;t let go</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">of their grandparents yeah i think but</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">you know there&#39;s obviously our whole</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:52.240" style="s2">tradition is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">uh infiltrated by the uh by two</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.240" end="00:56:56.559" style="s2">threat as they say jerusalem and athens</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:57:00.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.559" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">plato and uh uh judeo-christianity</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.559" end="00:57:04.480" style="s2">and both of them have are foundational</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">to who we are and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.480" end="00:57:07.440" style="s2">both of them have some good points and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">both of them have some bad points if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.440" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">ever want to read a nightmare read</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:13.680" style="s2">plato&#39;s republic right</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">uh personally i love socrates but uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.680" end="00:57:18.319" style="s2">in that one not so much right or</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:20.559" style="s2">essentially he&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.319" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">describing something not too far from uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.559" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">the chinese</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:25.680" style="s2">panopticon as uh as the way to run a</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:29.520" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.680" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">yeah by contrast</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.520" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">their socrates of what are referred to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">as release or credit dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:38.640" style="s2">i find in my own idealization to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">someone who</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.640" end="00:57:42.240" style="s2">is really neat and appropriate for our</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:44.559" style="s2">time and i think john viveki is</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.240" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">interested in socrates as well</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.559" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">i mean to say that here is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">is open to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">enquiring with someone whether that</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:55.280" style="s2">person be a statesman</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:57.280" style="s2">or a craftsman about fundamental matters</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.280" end="00:57:59.760" style="s2">of existence</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.280" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">without claiming that he knows what</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.760" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">wisdom is or</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:04.240" style="s2">the way he knows what knowledge is he</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">knows what piety is or he knows what</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.240" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2">virtue is or or what have you they go on</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:13.599" style="s2">possibly with the view to converging on</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:15.520" style="s2">mutual understanding but often with</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.599" end="00:58:16.720" style="s2">with a view to actually come into their</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.520" end="00:58:20.799" style="s2">state of confusion</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.720" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">together i i so if socrates were alive</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.799" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">today he&#39;d be continually pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">we are fusculatory when it comes to our</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:31.839" style="s2">own sorts of confusions we</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">keep masking our basic confusions from</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.839" end="00:58:34.799" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:36.480" style="s2">so that would be another way of coming</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.799" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">back to the point you&#39;re asking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.480" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">how how to change things</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:41.599" style="s2">so this is a third point that is you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">start to</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.599" end="00:58:47.599" style="s2">help people to unmask</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:50.799" style="s2">the ways in which they are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.599" end="00:58:52.880" style="s2">fundamental forms of misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.799" end="00:58:54.480" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s uh that&#39;s bang on</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.880" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">well i&#39;m going to end it right there i</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.480" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">think we&#39;ve gone a little over our</p>

<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:01.920" style="s2">but this conversation was so</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.440" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">interesting and rich i think it was</p>
