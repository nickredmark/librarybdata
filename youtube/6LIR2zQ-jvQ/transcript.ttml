<p begin="00:00:13.010" end="00:00:15.010" style="s2">You</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.230" end="00:00:23.180" style="s2">Well, I&#39;m pleased today to be talking to Ben Shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.780" end="00:00:31.099" style="s2">Ben I think really doesn&#39;t need an introduction at least not to most of you who will be there watching or listening to this given</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.100" end="00:00:34.610" style="s2">That he&#39;s now one of the most recognized individuals on the american political</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.400" end="00:00:37.999" style="s2">journalism scene in any case</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:44.359" style="s2">Ben&#39;s an American Lawyer writer journalist and political commentator. He&#39;s written 10 books</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.420" end="00:00:50.960" style="s2">The latest of which is the right side of history a reason and moral purpose made the West great</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.239" end="00:00:56.539" style="s2">Which has become a number one New York Times bestseller. I think it&#39;s at number four right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.540" end="00:00:57.480" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.480" end="00:01:02.809" style="s2">think Ben just mentioned to me that he sold about a hundred and fifty thousand copies since it was released and that was only a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.809" end="00:01:09.829" style="s2">Couple of weeks ago so that&#39;s going very well. He became the youngest nationally syndicated column in the u.s. At age 17</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.830" end="00:01:15.499" style="s2">he&#39;s also one of the most recognized current commentators on the new media YouTube and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:21.979" style="s2">Podcasts serves as editor in chief for The Daily wire which he founded and is the host of the Ben Shapiro show</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:24.379" style="s2">which runs daily on podcast and radio</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.080" end="00:01:31.549" style="s2">He&#39;s managed to transform himself into a one-man media empire and it&#39;s quite the accomplishment done</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.760" end="00:01:35.269" style="s2">He&#39;s also an extraordinarily interesting person</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.270" end="00:01:42.530" style="s2">I think to fall Omaha to watch in his interactions with people publicly because he&#39;s an unbelievably sharp debater and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.170" end="00:01:49.369" style="s2">Fastest verbally fastest people that I&#39;ve ever met. So it&#39;s good. We&#39;re gonna talk about his book today</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.369" end="00:01:56.449" style="s2">That&#39;s the right side of history. How reason and moral purpose made the West great and I can tell you right there</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.450" end="00:02:00.769" style="s2">there&#39;s four reasons for social justice types to be irritated just if the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:02.759" style="s2">Just at there</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.759" end="00:02:08.148" style="s2">What would you call it the daring of the title? So let&#39;s talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:10.940" style="s2">Tell me about your book</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.329" end="00:02:16.939" style="s2">The reason that I wrote the book is because in 2016, I kind of looked around and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.519" end="00:02:20.629" style="s2">For the record I didn&#39;t vote for either of the presidential candidates in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.630" end="00:02:25.100" style="s2">Neither of them met my minimum standard to be President based on the evidence and I looked at</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.560" end="00:02:32.149" style="s2">The sort of attitude that had changed in America used to be that we&#39;d have elections and they were really fraught people were angry</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.319" end="00:02:37.929" style="s2">Other people were upset each other but the rage seemed almost out of control in the last election cycle in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.930" end="00:02:42.700" style="s2">I was personally receiving enormous number of death threats for my positions on</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.670" end="00:02:46.959" style="s2">Politics I was receiving enormous amount of hatred from the the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.150" end="00:02:51.250" style="s2">I know that there are some of the media like the economists who have falsely labeled me outright</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.250" end="00:02:56.559" style="s2">Which is hilarious to me since I&#39;ve been their most outspoken critic for several years at this point and that year in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.560" end="00:02:58.899" style="s2">I was their number one target according to the anti-defamation league</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.739" end="00:03:08.018" style="s2">One of those tricky enough to be part of the alt-right and also their enemy, right? No we Jews man</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.540" end="00:03:13.219" style="s2">Various</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.219" end="00:03:14.689" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.689" end="00:03:19.179" style="s2">In any case. Yeah, I was receiving all sorts of blowback for that at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.180" end="00:03:25.540" style="s2">I was going on college campuses and being protested to the extent that I was requiring hundreds of police officers to accompany me on</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.939" end="00:03:28.659" style="s2">At certain college campuses and I started to think</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.819" end="00:03:32.768" style="s2">There is something deeply wrong here and it&#39;s not just that we are disagreeing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.769" end="00:03:39.129" style="s2">it&#39;s that there&#39;s a certain level of hatred and tribalism that&#39;s building up in American politics that I hadn&#39;t really seen before there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.129" end="00:03:40.459" style="s2">feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.459" end="00:03:45.908" style="s2">Even back as late as 2009 that America was moving in the right direction. You post Obama&#39;s election</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.909" end="00:03:51.219" style="s2">There was a feeling like, okay. Well, we have the same fundamental principles. We&#39;re trying to perfect those principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.220" end="00:03:56.049" style="s2">We may disagree over the ramifications of those principles. Some of us may want more government involved in health care</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.049" end="00:03:59.258" style="s2">So must want less some of us may want more regulations in markets</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.259" end="00:04:02.919" style="s2">Some of us may want less or redistribution ism or non or non redistribution ISM</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.919" end="00:04:08.019" style="s2">But the the fundamental principles things like free speech things like the inherent value of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.419" end="00:04:10.749" style="s2">Things like the idea that I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:12.979" style="s2">Generally respect your right to your own labor</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.979" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">these these were all things that we sort of agreed on and then we were trying to broaden that out to encompass further groups and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.340" end="00:04:25.000" style="s2">As time moved on it seemed like we were moving away from a lot of those fundamental assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.000" end="00:04:28.929" style="s2">He started to see rises in the opioid epidemic in suicide rates</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">He started to see a general level of unhappiness crop up that was reflected in the political tribalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:37.209" style="s2">I was feeling but wasn&#39;t reflected more general as more generally in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.699" end="00:04:38.900" style="s2">actual lowered life</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.900" end="00:04:45.219" style="s2">Expectancy in the United States for the first time in decades and I started to think there&#39;s an actual deeper problem wrong here</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.350" end="00:04:50.959" style="s2">Than just we disagree on politics. There&#39;s something deeply wrong here. We don&#39;t trust our institutions anymore by poll data</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:58.010" style="s2">Most of us don&#39;t know or trust all of our neighbors all of this stuff speaks to a dissolution of the social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.230" end="00:05:05.209" style="s2">So why is that happening? What&#39;s and this is nearly unjustifiable. I mean if you look at us just from a material prosperity level</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:08.959" style="s2">It&#39;s unjustifiable. If you look at us from a political freedom level it&#39;s unjustifiable</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:14.360" style="s2">We are the freest most prosperous people in the history of the world and yet we&#39;re totally pissed off at each other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.360" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">and we&#39;re filling that that hole with anger and with social mobbing on online and with woke scolding and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.410" end="00:05:23.900" style="s2">And where&#39;s all this coming from?</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.900" end="00:05:26.330" style="s2">and that led me to to write the book which</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.700" end="00:05:28.140" style="s2">essentially argues that</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.140" end="00:05:32.479" style="s2">We&#39;ve forgotten the foundations of our civilization the principles we used to holding calm and have deep roots</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.480" end="00:05:36.619" style="s2">and when we forget those roots we tend to move away from the principles themselves, and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.780" end="00:05:40.640" style="s2">Manifested in what I think is the great debate over Western civilization right now one side</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.640" end="00:05:47.689" style="s2">Which says Western civilization was rooted in good eternal immutable truths that were not always perfectly realized and that over time</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.690" end="00:05:51.950" style="s2">We have we have moved toward greater realization of and that&#39;s why the West is great</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.950" end="00:05:55.700" style="s2">That&#39;s why the West has provided material prosperity to the vast majority of the globe</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.700" end="00:05:59.119" style="s2">It&#39;s why 80 percent of people have been raised from abject poverty since 1980</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:05.149" style="s2">It&#39;s why you&#39;ve seen this this massive increase in the number of people who are living in decent conditions</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.150" end="00:06:10.970" style="s2">It&#39;s also why you see a rise in democracy a rise in political liberalism. Small small-l kind of classical liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.400" end="00:06:15.260" style="s2">all of this is the results of the West and so we ought to thank the West and we got to look back to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.260" end="00:06:22.099" style="s2">roots and see what is there worth preserving and then there&#39;s a that seems I would say to be a viewpoint that would have broadly</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.350" end="00:06:24.030" style="s2">characterized both</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.030" end="00:06:28.460" style="s2">Conservatives and classic liberals as far as I&#39;m concerned no research. That&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.490" end="00:06:28.830" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.830" end="00:06:34.549" style="s2">then there&#39;s the second point of view and the second point of view has cropped up and become very prominent in the West in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.550" end="00:06:35.130" style="s2">last</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.130" end="00:06:36.060" style="s2">couple of decades</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.060" end="00:06:43.940" style="s2">Particularly since the 1960s and that perspective is that Western civilization is really just a mask for hierarchy that basically there&#39;s a bunch of power</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.100" end="00:06:47.299" style="s2">Hierarchies and subjugate sub and not natural hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.330" end="00:06:52.399" style="s2">forcible oppressive hierarchies white people against black people rich people against poor people</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.680" end="00:06:58.700" style="s2">the powerful against the non powerful the 1% against the 99% and all of these institutions things like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.950" end="00:07:03.080" style="s2">Things like the things like free speech itself things like free markets</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.080" end="00:07:10.009" style="s2">These are actually just excuses for domination and subjugation. They&#39;re not actual principles. We hold to they&#39;re not important principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.010" end="00:07:10.380" style="s2">in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.380" end="00:07:11.820" style="s2">those principles have to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.820" end="00:07:18.019" style="s2">rooted out so that we can have a better humanity bloom in the wake of all of this now in my perspective this takes for</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.020" end="00:07:19.610" style="s2">granted all of the prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.610" end="00:07:21.830" style="s2">It seems to assume that the natural state of man is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.930" end="00:07:25.670" style="s2">Prosperity and freedom when in fact the natural state of man is misery and short life</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.310" end="00:07:32.899" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s an interesting thing right there that I&#39;ve been thinking about quite a bit. It&#39;s as if the radical left I</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.510" end="00:07:37.580" style="s2">mean there&#39;s denial on the radical left of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.190" end="00:07:45.890" style="s2">Biological differences between men and women right? Everything&#39;s socio-culturally constructed that seems to me to be rooted in an even deeper</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.410" end="00:07:50.540" style="s2">denial of biology and nature in a more fundamental sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.540" end="00:07:55.010" style="s2">I mean the left worships nature as something intrinsically positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.980" end="00:07:58.670" style="s2">you see that reflected in the more radical forms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.890" end="00:08:04.609" style="s2">environmentalism and some of the more toxic anti humanism that goes along with that like the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.890" end="00:08:10.609" style="s2">We&#39;re a cancer on the face of the planet or that the world would be better off if there weren&#39;t human beings on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.950" end="00:08:18.169" style="s2">but what seems to not be part of that which is quite surprising to me is any recognition that although</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.660" end="00:08:21.859" style="s2">Nature is let&#39;s call it at least or inspiring</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.980" end="00:08:29.869" style="s2">Which also includes the positive it&#39;s also now unbelievably deadly force and the the truth of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.870" end="00:08:35.479" style="s2">is that the natural state of human beings is privation and want right from birth and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.120" end="00:08:37.710" style="s2">to blame</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.710" end="00:08:42.229" style="s2">What and what seems to happen so often on the radical left is that that&#39;s ignored entirely</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.229" end="00:08:45.229" style="s2">it&#39;s as if the natural state of human beings is</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:53.150" style="s2">Plenty and delight delight in existence and that all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.450" end="00:09:01.700" style="s2">The terrible things that happen to people in their lives are actually can be laid at the feet of faulty social institutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.880" end="00:09:05.119" style="s2">it&#39;s like three is such a strange position given that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.910" end="00:09:09.559" style="s2">evidence that nature is trying to do us in on a regular basis is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.380" end="00:09:14.329" style="s2">Overwhelming I don&#39;t know if the if the left is so</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.029" end="00:09:17.388" style="s2">positively inclined in a romantic manner</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:25.219" style="s2">towards the idea of nature because that strengthens their position that all of the pathology that</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.560" end="00:09:27.560" style="s2">characterizes the world can be laid at the feet of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.529" end="00:09:30.648" style="s2">institutions and particularly capitalist institutions</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.529" end="00:09:33.919" style="s2">But it still seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.500" end="00:09:39.320" style="s2">It&#39;s a strange phenomenon. Well, it&#39;s it&#39;s strange and it&#39;s and it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.870" end="00:09:44.929" style="s2">Ignorant, but I think there&#39;s something else that that really is going on here. The Marxist of today are</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.480" end="00:09:50.779" style="s2">Arguing many of them are arguing that what they&#39;re really wanting is greater shared material prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.779" end="00:09:54.439" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s actually what&#39;s capturing the minds of people right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:10:00.409" style="s2">I think what&#39;s actually capturing the lines of people was the spiritual promise of Marxism the idea that Marx lays out</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:02.130" style="s2">even in the communist manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.130" end="00:10:09.229" style="s2">When he is talking about the transformation of man in his initial argument is that markets war people that people who have become?</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:15.769" style="s2">Meaner and cruder and ruder and more terrible because of markets because they are self-interested in that the markets emphasize</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.099" style="s2">Self-interest as opposed to altruism and therefore if you got rid of markets</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.100" end="00:10:22.490" style="s2">Then you could exist in greater peace and prosperity and plenty</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:28.219" style="s2">Because human beings themselves would transform so it&#39;s not that the system itself would create greater material prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.440" end="00:10:31.640" style="s2">It&#39;s that in the initial run. It probably would create more privation</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.640" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">It&#39;s that in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:37.339" style="s2">Human beings would be transformed in their souls by all of this and then they would feel greater</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.410" end="00:10:40.760" style="s2">Bonds to the people around them. That was the spiritual promise of Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.760" end="00:10:45.229" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s I at root what a lot of people in the West are resonating</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.510" end="00:10:48.229" style="s2">ok, so that&#39;s that&#39;s a hope for something like</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.839" end="00:10:51.259" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s almost like a religious Redemption. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:58.698" style="s2">It&#39;s a strange thing to you know, I&#39;m preparing for this debate that I&#39;m going to have with Slava g-shock on April 19th</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.699" end="00:11:03.049" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been trying to think it through and one of the things that&#39;s really struck me is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.480" end="00:11:06.709" style="s2">Not only are the solutions that Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.440" end="00:11:09.300" style="s2">Marxism offers</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.300" end="00:11:15.500" style="s2">Error ridden to say the least given the historical evidence and and I just don&#39;t see how anybody can deny that</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.500" end="00:11:23.000" style="s2">Although people certainly do but that the problem that the Marxists originally identified seems to actually to be vanishing</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:25.399" style="s2">I mean as you already pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.220" end="00:11:30.290" style="s2">There&#39;s unparalleled increase in material prosperity among</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.800" end="00:11:36.529" style="s2">Not only among the rich which you could complain about if you were concerned about inequality</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:39.800" style="s2">but among the poorest people in the world like we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.250" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">absolute material privation based on UN standards by 50% between the year 2000 and</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.070" end="00:11:53.540" style="s2">2012 and the cynics say that&#39;s because we set the standard for material privation too low, which is dollar ninety a day</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.540" end="00:11:55.540" style="s2">But if you look at the curves</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.560" end="00:11:57.360" style="s2">that you can generate at</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.360" end="00:12:01.189" style="s2">Levels of three dollars and 80 cents a day or seven dollars and sixty cents a day</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.190" end="00:12:05.450" style="s2">You see exactly the same thing happening and you see rapid increases in</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.970" end="00:12:10.790" style="s2">Economic growth in sub-saharan Africa, like, you know 7% growth rates</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.790" end="00:12:15.050" style="s2">which are more typically characteristic say of China or India and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.870" end="00:12:17.990" style="s2">And that&#39;s manifested in</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.110" end="00:12:20.640" style="s2">unbelievably positive</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.640" end="00:12:23.509" style="s2">statistical evidence such as not suggesting that now the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.420" end="00:12:29.240" style="s2">Child mortality rate in Africa is the same as it was in Europe in 1952</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.250" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">And so the Marxists original complaint was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:35.629" style="s2">the rich were going to get richer and the poor were going to get poorer and</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.850" end="00:12:37.879" style="s2">that that would that could be laid at the feet of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.160" end="00:12:43.730" style="s2">capitalism just like the fact of hierarchy itself could be laid at the feet of capitalism and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.790" end="00:12:47.540" style="s2">It&#39;s clear that capitalism although it does produce</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.910" end="00:12:55.369" style="s2">Hierarchical inequality just like every other system that we know of it also produces wealth and that wealth is actually being very effectively</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.500" end="00:12:57.300" style="s2">distributed to the people</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.300" end="00:13:00.769" style="s2">You know, perhaps not primarily to the people who most need it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.870" end="00:13:07.190" style="s2">But to the people who most need it in ways that are truly mattering and so to me the entire the entire</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.550" end="00:13:15.319" style="s2">Structure of Marxism is is it&#39;s it&#39;s an anachronistic. The problem is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:20.390" style="s2">appropriately formulated and the solution tends to be deadly if</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.180" end="00:13:24.049" style="s2">Counterproductive if not deadly. So it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.140" end="00:13:29.989" style="s2">Maybe here here&#39;s something I&#39;ve been thinking about too. You tell me what you think about this</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.660" end="00:13:32.660" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.910" end="00:13:35.029" style="s2">Some of it still has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.550" end="00:13:39.319" style="s2">Innate human emotional response to inequality, you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.320" end="00:13:45.809" style="s2">When you walk down the street, you see a runed alcoholic schizophrenic who&#39;s obviously suffering in 50 different dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.060" end="00:13:52.710" style="s2">It&#39;s very difficult to feel positive about the state of humanity in the world, and it&#39;s very easy for a reflexive</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:13:59.309" style="s2">Compassion to take over and say well wouldn&#39;t it be something if we could just retool society so that none of that was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">It must be someone&#39;s fault</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:04.260" style="s2">It must be something that we&#39;re not doing right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.260" end="00:14:12.059" style="s2">There&#39;s some truth in that because of course our systems could be better than they are and and it seems to me to be that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.460" end="00:14:14.170" style="s2">unreflective</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.170" end="00:14:22.110" style="s2">Compassion that drives whatever residual attractiveness that Marxism still has apart also from the darker</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.330" end="00:14:29.039" style="s2">possibility which is that it really does appeal to the jealousy that&#39;s characteristic of people in the envy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:35.940" style="s2">Which manifests itself as hatred for hierarchy on the basis that some people are doing better than me</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.370" end="00:14:37.029" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.029" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2">so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:40.080" style="s2">think there&#39;s also there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.390" end="00:14:46.229" style="s2">Failure on the part of advocates of the free-market to point out that free markets are good for what they are good for meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.330" end="00:14:49.889" style="s2">the two things that are important to recognize about free markets 1</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.110" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">Free markets are there to create a generalized level of cheaper goods and better products at cheaper prices more widely available</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:14:59.230" style="s2">That&#39;s what markets do and they do it brilliantly</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.230" end="00:15:03.719" style="s2">Well, that doesn&#39;t mean that that that markets are there to take care of the person who is unable to work</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.720" end="00:15:08.400" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s not something that markets are there to do it&#39;s something I talked about in the book the need for a social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.400" end="00:15:09.750" style="s2">If you want a free market</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.750" end="00:15:12.119" style="s2">You also have to have a social fabric that helps pick people up</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.120" end="00:15:15.929" style="s2">Now people on the Left have said the government should be the air SATs social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.930" end="00:15:20.820" style="s2">the government should pick those people up and in large-scale cases, maybe that needs to be the case, but</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.370" end="00:15:27.570" style="s2">Usually it was religious communities and informal social fabrics that actually filled those gaps beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.580" end="00:15:28.450" style="s2">there is a</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.450" end="00:15:33.270" style="s2">Second problem and that is I hear a lot of populist on both left and right make the statement that we just need to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.400" end="00:15:39.239" style="s2">Make markets work for us and all I can think when I hear that is your funder Lima. You have fundamentally misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.250" end="00:15:45.929" style="s2">What a market is so Marxism is a set of values and then a system of economics crafted atop the set of values</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.930" end="00:15:48.089" style="s2">so the set of values as you said before is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.370" end="00:15:53.010" style="s2">Equality should trump prosperity and equality should from freedom that equality should trump everything</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.010" end="00:15:58.179" style="s2">So if equality Trump said then the only way to make everyone equal is to turn them into in</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.389" end="00:16:03.969" style="s2">Indistinguishable widgets controlled from above until we create an economic system to do that</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.040" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">There are principles that undergird free markets free markets are not a human</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.999" end="00:16:12.339" style="s2">Construction free markets are a recognition that you are an individual human being in control of your own labor</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.529" end="00:16:17.888" style="s2">That&#39;s simple understanding means that you cannot support any other form of a market now</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.889" end="00:16:21.308" style="s2">You can support some form of redistribution ISM at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.309" end="00:16:24.579" style="s2">You can try and urge people to be more moral by giving to their fellow man</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.579" end="00:16:29.229" style="s2">But markets themselves are a recognition of a basic truth that Marxism rejects</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.240" end="00:16:36.729" style="s2">Which is that freedom and individualism ought to trump and indeed need to trump the the need for equality</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.730" end="00:16:39.819" style="s2">So the freedom versus equality battle is very much alive in our time</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.819" end="00:16:42.248" style="s2">And because we have such freedom people tend toward equality</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.249" end="00:16:47.379" style="s2">I think when you have we should talk about a little bit about equality - because there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.779" end="00:16:52.628" style="s2">important but there&#39;s two important modes of equality that are</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.149" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">that that have to be segregated and discussed separately because</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.860" end="00:16:59.860" style="s2">people tend to confuse</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.139" end="00:17:07.448" style="s2">Equality of opportunity with equality of outcome, right? I think that it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to be a free-market champion</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.449" end="00:17:09.519" style="s2">let&#39;s say or at least an appreciator of</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:17.049" style="s2">the utility of free markets and to be strongly in favor of equality of opportunity, which means that you try to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.569" end="00:17:20.048" style="s2">remove from the market system any</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.929" end="00:17:22.789" style="s2">impediments to people</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.789" end="00:17:27.999" style="s2">manifesting those talents that would make them effective and competent players in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:30.470" style="s2">productive market itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.470" end="00:17:37.959" style="s2">Not on the basis of the fact that that&#39;s counterproductive for everyone the individuals but also for everyone who could be benefiting from their talent</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.659" end="00:17:42.009" style="s2">Yeah, that&#39;s absolutely true. And I think that&#39;s inherent in the idea of markets</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.010" end="00:17:47.799" style="s2">It&#39;s why when people use terms like crony capitalism, I always think there&#39;s no such thing. There&#39;s there&#39;s corporate there</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.799" end="00:17:50.528" style="s2">There&#39;s corporate corporate ISM, which is a better description of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.720" end="00:17:56.500" style="s2">crony capitalism is a self refuting proposition capitalism and free markets are based on exactly what you&#39;re talking about because again,</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.500" end="00:17:58.779" style="s2">The fundamental principle is I own my own labor</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.789" end="00:18:04.658" style="s2">Which means that if you impede my ability to alienate that labor you are now interfering with my labor</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.730" end="00:18:11.230" style="s2">So free markets are predicated on an idea of equality and rights and the idea of every human being</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">Made at is why I say there&#39;s a judeo-christian heritage to free markets</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.630" end="00:18:17.170" style="s2">Every human being made in the in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.170" end="00:18:20.980" style="s2">Which I think is the single most important sentence written in the history of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.350" end="00:18:24.999" style="s2">When you abandon the the we tend to think that these things naturally occurred</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.000" end="00:18:30.010" style="s2">This is where you get into the Enlightenment argument. The Enlightenment argument is that you can just reason your way to these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.140" end="00:18:32.230" style="s2">Well, you can reason your way to these things there</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.230" end="00:18:35.529" style="s2">Also a lot of other things you can reason your way to including communism and fascism</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.630" end="00:18:37.960" style="s2">The question is where what are your starting points?</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.960" end="00:18:42.249" style="s2">What are the actual fundamental assumptions that you make about human beings and the nature of the world?</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:46.329" style="s2">That you then apply reason to to arrive at something great</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.330" end="00:18:46.910" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.910" end="00:18:48.380" style="s2">this is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.380" end="00:18:54.550" style="s2">not a fan of the the Enlightenment view that just if we start tabula rasa we can come up with exactly the system that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:18:59.680" style="s2">built today, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s either historically accurate or philosophically accurate because</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.260" end="00:19:03.879" style="s2">We see that human beings reach a wide variety of conclusions based on different premises</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.880" end="00:19:10.300" style="s2">Well, it&#39;s also the case that it assumes that reason in fact in some sense can be complete in</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.090" end="00:19:13.449" style="s2">Its ability to generate its own</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:20.679" style="s2">Comprehensive axioms which can also be justified on rational grounds and it&#39;s not obvious to me that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.680" end="00:19:27.159" style="s2">I think that&#39;s why that founders of the Declaration of Independence were forced to say we find these truths to be self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.920" end="00:19:34.509" style="s2">right, you have to have a starting point and this is something that I do believe that people like Steven Pinker who I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.510" end="00:19:36.510" style="s2">great amount of admiration for</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.590" end="00:19:38.480" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.480" end="00:19:42.909" style="s2">make an error in their over valuation of the Enlightenment and and their</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.640" end="00:19:45.640" style="s2">devaluation of the historical</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.250" end="00:19:50.770" style="s2">What the vast historical epochs that produced the works of imagination?</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.410" end="00:19:58.810" style="s2">that produced the axioms on which the Enlightenment could originally emerge and and you and I seem to agree I think very</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.240" end="00:20:05.049" style="s2">Precisely on especially that phrase that you just used. I mean, I think there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:07.910" style="s2">statements in</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.850" end="00:20:26.199" style="s2">potential and chaos was something approximating a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.600" end="00:20:31.629" style="s2">process that was characterized by truth and courage and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.149" end="00:20:38.169" style="s2">There&#39;s an idea there and which is why I think God continually repeats after he creates day after day</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.359" end="00:20:40.359" style="s2">That the creation was good</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.429" end="00:20:43.929" style="s2">And so the idea is that if you face the potential of the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.970" end="00:20:48.039" style="s2">Which is I think something that human beings do with their consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.039" end="00:20:55.478" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what consciousness is for if you face the world with truth and courage then what you generate out of that field of</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.759" end="00:21:02.079" style="s2">Possibilities is in fact good even though the price the print you may pay a price for the truth in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.330" end="00:21:05.319" style="s2">it&#39;s an act of faith even in some sense, which</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.929" end="00:21:11.798" style="s2">reflects that axiomatic presupposition that there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s going to improve the world more than</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:19.898" style="s2">Forthright confrontation with the structure of reality and an attempt to abide by the truth and then you have that second statement</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.899" end="00:21:25.029" style="s2">Which is a miraculous statement, I believe it&#39;s hard to see it as anything else</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:29.109" style="s2">That both men and women are made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.109" end="00:21:33.879" style="s2">We&#39;ve we&#39;ve already had gone established as the Creator and the Creator who creates in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.369" end="00:21:41.079" style="s2">ethical manner and then that power or ability or virtue or privilege or</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.629" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">responsibility is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:44.599" style="s2">transferred to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.599" end="00:21:52.089" style="s2">human beings and it&#39;s transferred to men and women and I also find out actually quite stunning, you know, because there&#39;s no shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.849" end="00:21:54.200" style="s2">postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.200" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">feminist criticism of the judeo-christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.320" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">Claiming that it&#39;s fundamentally oppressive and patriarchal and yet right at the beginning you have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.659" end="00:22:07.059" style="s2">incredible statement which which seems to fly in the face of its of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.519" end="00:22:12.758" style="s2">Anachronistic nature of the document stating that it&#39;s not just men that are made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.759" end="00:22:15.219" style="s2">it&#39;s men and women and that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.009" end="00:22:21.159" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious to me how that conclusion was reached so long ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:29.858" style="s2">Yep, that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right and it&#39;s also important to note that historically speaking if you look at surrounding documents documents for Mesopotamia typically</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.859" end="00:22:36.459" style="s2">The the actual language that was used the image of God language is actually not unique to the Bible exist in other cultures</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.460" end="00:22:38.919" style="s2">But it was always the king who was made in the image of God, right?</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.919" end="00:22:45.849" style="s2">So the people who are most powerful who are mainly that extension of that to all human beings is a unique moment in in philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.340" end="00:22:52.480" style="s2">History and as you say the idea that God has created an orderly universe and that we have the capacity to act out within that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.480" end="00:22:56.980" style="s2">Universe and to see God from behind so to speak that we can&#39;t necessarily see his face</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.980" end="00:23:01.000" style="s2">but we can see sort of the general outline of what he is intending and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.250" end="00:23:07.750" style="s2">Another verse from Genesis that I think is deeply important is from the Cain and Abel story the verse where God says to Cain Tim</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.750" end="00:23:10.359" style="s2">Shell that you have the ability to do better than this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.240" end="00:23:15.760" style="s2">Stephanie says, you know I why didn&#39;t you accept my sacrifice and God says well 10 your control</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.760" end="00:23:20.020" style="s2">you know go out and do something about it and then of course came rejects that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.210" end="00:23:24.399" style="s2">That story is so deep and I think it really is the story of what&#39;s happening right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.860" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">Exactly you have</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:33.549" style="s2">God&#39;s reaction. The Cain is that I rejected you because you could do better</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:37.749" style="s2">Right, and that&#39;s actually a kind of compliment even though you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.750" end="00:23:42.760" style="s2">If you&#39;re not offering up the proper sacrifices and things aren&#39;t working out for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.760" end="00:23:47.770" style="s2">It might not be the kind of compliment that you want to hear but it is a testament to the potential of the human</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.960" end="00:23:51.159" style="s2">Spirit and so you&#39;re making the case in your book</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:57.789" style="s2">And and this is the this isn&#39;t what would you call an injunction an encouragement to the Enlightenment types?</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.010" end="00:24:00.010" style="s2">to look to their</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.500" end="00:24:07.630" style="s2">Axioms and to think hard about how it could be that the idea of individual democratic freedom. For example</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.630" end="00:24:09.729" style="s2">and all of the wonderful explicit political</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.700" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">ideas that came out of the Enlightenment could have possibly</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.870" end="00:24:16.929" style="s2">emerged and I do agree that</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:25.089" style="s2">you have to have that initial conception of the individual as sovereign and that that sovereignty has to be associated with something akin to</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.549" end="00:24:28.119" style="s2">recognition of divinity at least</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:36.459" style="s2">insofar as what&#39;s regarded as divine is regarded as the highest of all possible values and then it is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.250" end="00:24:43.149" style="s2">Surprising as you pointed out that not only is the idea of the image of God extended to men and women</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.149" end="00:24:45.149" style="s2">But that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.740" end="00:24:48.309" style="s2">Explicitly not the domain of kings</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.230" end="00:24:52.169" style="s2">Who in fact might be more at risk for?</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.260" end="00:24:55.379" style="s2">abandoning their actions as</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:01.350" style="s2">Avatars of God so to speak then those who are in privation, you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.350" end="00:25:06.689" style="s2">You see that consistently in the Old Testament where the Kings are being taken to task</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.030" end="00:25:12.030" style="s2">Constantly by prophets who do appear to speak more in the language of God</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.030" end="00:25:16.530" style="s2">let&#39;s say and then you see it also in the New Testament with thee with the insistence that</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.080" end="00:25:19.080" style="s2">the wealthy and powerful have</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.750" end="00:25:21.220" style="s2">impediments to</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.220" end="00:25:26.040" style="s2">Proper ethical action that those who are less materially fortunate might not face</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.160" end="00:25:30.599" style="s2">Ya and that sematic is is present obviously in the old testement</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.600" end="00:25:36.419" style="s2">There&#39;s actually a passage where it&#39;s talking about the sacrifices. I believe it&#39;s in the Book of Leviticus where it talks about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.240" end="00:25:43.199" style="s2">accidental sin sacrifices and it talks about the common man and says if you shall sin then you bring the sacrifice and then it says</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.510" end="00:25:48.479" style="s2">With regard to the Prince the nasi it says with regards to the Prince. The Hebrew word is cost share</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:49.809" style="s2">It says when you will sit</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.809" end="00:25:52.829" style="s2">so the assumption is that if you have great power the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:57.929" style="s2">chances of your sinning are going to be greater because you are going to conceive of yourself as higher than others and this is going</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.929" end="00:25:59.290" style="s2">to lead you down a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.290" end="00:26:00.190" style="s2">dark path</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.190" end="00:26:06.210" style="s2">The the point with regard to the Enlightenment is that we actually have some counter evidence of the Enlightenment being awesome</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.340" end="00:26:09.030" style="s2">All the way through if it is predicated solely on</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.429" end="00:26:15.149" style="s2">Reason and not on a historic understanding of of these principles and that is the French enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.150" end="00:26:19.259" style="s2">I mean this was one of my key points when it when I was looking at a Pinker&#39;s book enlightenment now</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.260" end="00:26:21.959" style="s2">But you again you and I agree on this. I have great enlightenment for pinker</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.960" end="00:26:25.620" style="s2">I took a class with him when I was at Harvard Law School. He did a joint class with Alan Dershowitz</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.620" end="00:26:27.100" style="s2">I was kind of fun, but</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.100" end="00:26:28.750" style="s2">Pinker goes a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.750" end="00:26:32.699" style="s2">450 page book about the Enlightenment and he never mentions the French Revolution once</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.010" end="00:26:36.809" style="s2">And I thought I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s historically possible to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.820" end="00:26:43.080" style="s2">The Enlightenment was not just David Hume and Adam Smith and the American Founding Fathers the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.080" end="00:26:49.830" style="s2">Also was Russo and Voltaire and Robespierre and it was the and it was the German progressive enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.830" end="00:26:51.830" style="s2">That had a real dark side in</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.120" end="00:26:52.720" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.720" end="00:26:58.199" style="s2">Human reason can lead you to a lot of different very bad places the the metaphor that I like to use with regard to Western</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.270" end="00:27:02.219" style="s2">Civilization is that Western civilization is a suspension bridge and then on one</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.820" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">and it&#39;s over a river of as you would say chaos and on the one end of the bridge the big pole is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.140" end="00:27:14.100" style="s2">These fundamental assumptions you have to make about the nature of the world that I don&#39;t believe could be arrived at other than through some</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.100" end="00:27:18.989" style="s2">Form of divine revelation. This would be the judeo-christian tradition and those principles are things like we have free choice</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.990" end="00:27:25.770" style="s2">That&#39;s an assumption you have to make and is not implicit in scientific materialism the idea that history has a progressive nature you can improve</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.770" end="00:27:29.999" style="s2">The world around you again. That is not a that that is reliant on an assumption</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.440" style="s2">You have to make the idea that human beings are held to a morality that they themselves do not</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.540" end="00:27:38.700" style="s2">Subjectively create out of emotional mean and that is something that you have to make an assumption about</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.770" end="00:27:44.460" style="s2">The thing that the idea of objective truth itself is something you have to make an assumption about and that&#39;s an assumption that I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.460" end="00:27:45.400" style="s2">can be made most</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.400" end="00:27:51.239" style="s2">Specifically by the idea that there is a mind outside of us that creates that objective truth and stands behind an ordered universe</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.460" end="00:27:53.050" style="s2">all of those are some</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.050" end="00:27:56.430" style="s2">Judeo-christian values. I think there&#39;s evidence for much of this, you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.430" end="00:28:00.239" style="s2">One of the things that I&#39;ve been discussing with my audiences is like, you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.330" style="s2">It depends obviously on what you&#39;re willing to take as evidence</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.730" end="00:28:11.370" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t obvious to me at all that you can establish a functional relationship with yourself unless</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:17.519" style="s2">you hold yourself responsible for your actions and you regard yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.250" end="00:28:22.950" style="s2">Free agent in at least in some regards like obviously we&#39;re not omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.740" end="00:28:30.540" style="s2">Omnipresent and omnipotent that&#39;s clearly the case. We&#39;re subject to stringent limitations and there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.540" end="00:28:33.540" style="s2">situations in which our actions</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.150" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">devolve into</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.950" end="00:28:40.109" style="s2">Determinism that&#39;s obvious. Neurophysiological II. It has to be the way the world works</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.110" end="00:28:44.610" style="s2">Is that once you execute a decision there comes to a point where that decision is</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.580" end="00:28:48.419" style="s2">manifested in something approximating a deterministic manner</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.420" end="00:28:50.639" style="s2">I think the evidence for that is overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:57.119" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean that when you&#39;re looking out into the future and you&#39;re contemplating the many paths that you could take that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.940" end="00:29:02.909" style="s2">What you do to make your decisions then is deterministic in a simple in a simple manner</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.910" end="00:29:06.479" style="s2">I think if that was the case, there&#39;d be no need for consciousness at all</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.480" end="00:29:11.130" style="s2">And then I look at how people react to themselves is we hold ourselves responsible</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.400" end="00:29:14.400" style="s2">despite our own</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.530" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">inclination</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:17.849" style="s2">for the sins that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.190" end="00:29:24.029" style="s2">Manifest for the manners in which we wander off the path people wake up at 4:00 in the morning and they berate</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.340" end="00:29:25.950" style="s2">themselves for the actions</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.950" end="00:29:31.619" style="s2">they took that they knew they shouldn&#39;t and the in action that they manifested when they knew they should have acted and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.930" end="00:29:36.119" style="s2">If we were masters in our own house without that central moral compass</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.160" end="00:29:40.739" style="s2">There&#39;d be no reason at all for us to wake up and torture ourselves to death with our moral</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.800" end="00:29:49.529" style="s2">inequity and if you have a friend or a family member and you insist upon treating them as if they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.020" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">deterministic agent with no</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:58.739" style="s2">Effect on the future and no responsibility for their choices. It&#39;s actually impossible to have a relationship with them</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.740" end="00:30:03.270" style="s2">You can&#39;t even have a relationship with a two or three year old if you insist upon</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.060" end="00:30:11.369" style="s2">Infantilizing them in that manner and not attributing to them the choice that enables valid punishment</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:15.780" style="s2">Let&#39;s say on the one hand you&#39;ve done something wrong, and you need to be held accountable for it</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.780" end="00:30:23.700" style="s2">but also valid accomplishment on the other which is that you&#39;ve done something that you didn&#39;t have to do that was voluntary that&#39;s deserving of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.430" end="00:30:26.350" style="s2">approbation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.350" end="00:30:34.110" style="s2">reinforcement and we act that out and then the next level of evidence seems to be that if you found your</p>

<p begin="00:30:36.850" end="00:30:44.670" style="s2">Propositions. Other than that that the sovereignty of the individual and the responsibility of the individual the whole thing goes sideways</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.830" end="00:30:52.649" style="s2">So rapidly that it&#39;s almost indescribable and it doesn&#39;t just go sideways. It goes sideways and down and so like I don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.740" end="00:30:57.390" style="s2">What to make of that as a proof, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.390" end="00:31:01.530" style="s2">It&#39;s a strange sort of proof the proof being that well, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.290" end="00:31:05.369" style="s2">reasonable way for human beings to organize their</p>

<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:19.020" style="s2">And then this is where the main debate happens between me and sam Harris because Sam will</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:23.580" style="s2">Reason himself to those assumptions and away from those assumptions and to those assumptions in a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.580" end="00:31:26.219" style="s2">he&#39;ll use those assumptions in building other assumptions and</p>

<p begin="00:31:30.350" end="00:31:33.100" style="s2">So you can&#39;t really do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.170" end="00:31:35.829" style="s2">This is why I say I&#39;m the one hand you have to have those</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.020" end="00:31:41.410" style="s2">judeo-christian assumptions and those by the way under guard even the very concept of reason because the idea of reason is that you are using</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.410" end="00:31:43.410" style="s2">a willful process of thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:46.990" style="s2">in order to convince someone else</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.450" end="00:31:52.300" style="s2">Predicated on the notion that the other person&#39;s opinion is valuable and that you shouldn&#39;t just Club them over the head and take their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.300" end="00:31:57.310" style="s2">I think that reason it has the value of reason has implicit moral biases and those moral biases</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.310" end="00:32:00.879" style="s2">You can&#39;t reason your way to as I said, it&#39;s an evolutionary biology perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:07.869" style="s2">There&#39;s no reason for reason other than if you think that maybe you can convince unless especially in a world of non mass communication</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.880" end="00:32:12.010" style="s2">What is the reason for reason right in a world that pre-exists mass communication?</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.110" end="00:32:16.540" style="s2">What is the reason that you need reason wouldn&#39;t force be more effective for most of human history</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.540" end="00:32:19.359" style="s2">It was it was significantly more effective than reason</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.640" end="00:32:26.800" style="s2">Certainly, it&#39;s certainly what the radicals on the Left would argue even now I mean and the idea of reason seems to be predicated</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.800" end="00:32:31.389" style="s2">so and that would go along with the idea of free speech which I think is also equally</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.230" end="00:32:41.199" style="s2">Grounded in these underlying axioms is that you know, each of us as sovereign individuals have a valid mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.500" end="00:32:48.790" style="s2">about and there&#39;s something unique about that valid mode of existence and it&#39;s also something that can be communicated and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.160" end="00:32:52.209" style="s2">that part of the reason for rational discussion is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.760" end="00:32:57.310" style="s2">the ability to share that unique and valuable element of</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.950" end="00:33:00.069" style="s2">private experience with someone else is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.310" end="00:33:09.279" style="s2">salutary, but it&#39;s also so you tell it salutary in a manner that allows for the mutual spiritual transformation of both of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.280" end="00:33:11.210" style="s2">people that are involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.210" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">Discussion it seems to me that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.900" end="00:33:18.999" style="s2">If you&#39;re pro reason you&#39;ve already bought that argument exactly</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.000" end="00:33:21.790" style="s2">This is exactly right and so faith and reason to this</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.280" end="00:33:25.719" style="s2">extent are not intention faith undergirds reason because you have to make us</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.880" end="00:33:31.030" style="s2">Fundamental assumptions even to get to reason and this is why I think that one of the things that has happened and it&#39;s really unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.030" end="00:33:37.389" style="s2">I discuss it in the last chapters of the book is that when you take away the assumptions that undergoing reason reason itself?</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.460" end="00:33:42.040" style="s2">Collapses in it&#39;s not that reason the stains appear on top of the structure</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.040" end="00:33:46.390" style="s2">Once the structure Falls reason falls that too and we returned to our sort of tribal</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.150" end="00:33:49.090" style="s2">naturalistic roots that are quite dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.090" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">this is why I say that you need Jerusalem on one end of the bridge the other end of that suspension bridge is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.370" style="s2">Reason meaning that we can&#39;t be theocrats. We can&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.010" end="00:34:00.369" style="s2">fundamentalist religious texts and take them as</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.830" end="00:34:08.529" style="s2">As complete literal is completely literal and then hope to develop as a civilization on the basis of that complete literalism</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.530" end="00:34:13.330" style="s2">So you have to look to which of these Commandments for example in the Torah are directed toward human</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.850" end="00:34:15.850" style="s2">Eternal human nature so I would suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.640" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">Commandments that are directed toward reining in certain appetites are directed toward God&#39;s understanding of human nature that certain</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.480" end="00:34:28.870" style="s2">Injunctions with regards how we behave in the Ten Commandments. These are predicated on a on an understanding of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.870" end="00:34:32.140" style="s2">That is truly profound and worthwhile preserving</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.140" end="00:34:36.190" style="s2">it&#39;s also worth noting that the story of Western civilization is the expansion of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.470" end="00:34:42.880" style="s2">These principles out from the tribal and toward a broader range of humanity. And that&#39;s why the book is not just an argument</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.980" end="00:34:46.330" style="s2">Here&#39;s how I interpret the Bible and here&#39;s why that&#39;s right. It&#39;s an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.880" end="00:34:51.849" style="s2">Historical development was necessary after the Bible. So it is not just that the Bible solves all your problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.040" end="00:34:53.240" style="s2">It&#39;s that God</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.240" end="00:34:59.979" style="s2">Understands even from a religious perspective in Judaism and I think in Christianity too that we are going to apply human reason to these texts</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.980" end="00:35:02.590" style="s2">That&#39;s from a religious perspective from a non religious perspective</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.590" end="00:35:08.350" style="s2">the point I&#39;m making is that you have to take these fundamental assumptions whether you like them or not that are religiously rooted and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.350" end="00:35:10.350" style="s2">apply your reason to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.490" end="00:35:17.560" style="s2">Develop from the fundamental assumptions that we have already stated and that tension is what allows the suspension bridge to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.810" end="00:35:21.789" style="s2">Continue to function that doesn&#39;t mean that it is always equally solid throughout time</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.790" end="00:35:29.620" style="s2">It isn&#39;t because the tension sometimes wavers sometimes reason takes dominance. Sometimes judeo-christian values or Judaic biblical literalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.170" end="00:35:34.599" style="s2">Takes dominance. And if your bottom line is you collapse the reason you end up with theocracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.600" end="00:35:39.279" style="s2">You collapse judeo-christian values you end up with nihilism is sort of the basic argument. Okay, okay</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:44.170" style="s2">so so so, you know, one of the things that that Sam is afraid of and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.170" end="00:35:45.790" style="s2">There&#39;s some validity in this fear</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.790" end="00:35:52.180" style="s2">And I think he tends to apply this more to is to the the state of an Islamic fundamentalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.180" end="00:35:55.059" style="s2">But her same argument can be made with the other religious traditions</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:35:58.370" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.370" end="00:36:04.660" style="s2">Evangelical Christianity for example and maybe Orthodox Judaism who knows that the danger is that we&#39;ll take these</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.720" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">revealed truths which differ and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.810" end="00:36:09.980" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.980" end="00:36:17.290" style="s2">Holding them as absolute revealed truths will make us parochial tribal and the consequence of that will be all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.480" end="00:36:18.890" style="s2">catastrophe and horror</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.890" end="00:36:25.479" style="s2">right and you know one of the things I learned when I was studying the Old Testament, this was very interesting a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.060" end="00:36:30.430" style="s2">Jewish friend of mine or monoid sort of clued me into this because one of the things he told me was that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.160" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">Christians who emphasized the New Testament tend to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.080" end="00:36:42.489" style="s2">Parody the Old Testament God - odd somewhat unfair degree casting him as much more</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.010" end="00:36:45.460" style="s2">Tyrannical in some sense the god of Wrath. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.980" end="00:36:48.520" style="s2">Justice versus mercy. Yep, right exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.680" end="00:36:53.769" style="s2">So I took that seriously and especially when I was reading the Abrahamic stories and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.770" end="00:37:00.370" style="s2">You see you see throughout the earliest writings the idea that in some bizarre sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.340" end="00:37:03.260" style="s2">God can be bargained with</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.260" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:10.450" style="s2">and and and so you see that even in the Cain and Abel story because Cain actually faces God with his complaints and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.580" end="00:37:13.840" style="s2">Says well, you know, here&#39;s how I look at the world and go on</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.110" end="00:37:18.069" style="s2">Excoriates and because he believes that he&#39;s looking at the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.650" end="00:37:24.789" style="s2">improperly and I think for good reason but there is the implication that you could have a conversation with God and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.370" end="00:37:30.249" style="s2">Hypothetically learn something and but then it that transforms even more</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.710" end="00:37:38.289" style="s2">when you see the that the stories that follow so Abraham directly intercedes with God on on</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.870" end="00:37:44.079" style="s2">in in favor of Sodom right right because and and he makes a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.320" end="00:37:51.820" style="s2">What would you say extreme case for redeeming Sodom which seems to have degenerated into quite thee?</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.640" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">They did quite the state of Hell</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.460" end="00:38:01.389" style="s2">Trying to entice God into not being more destructive than necessary if there&#39;s any goodness to be found</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.390" end="00:38:04.989" style="s2">And he actually does that successfully and so that&#39;s very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.990" end="00:38:09.400" style="s2">So even though God is absolute in his judgment in some fundamental sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.950" end="00:38:13.629" style="s2">there is this Kapow Seifer dialogue which seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.150" end="00:38:20.889" style="s2">analogy to the idea that reason and revelation can coexist and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.170" end="00:38:23.620" style="s2">Bolster each other in some sort of upward development</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.720" end="00:38:29.530" style="s2">Well, then this is exactly right and then the idea of natural law which the seeds are there in the Judaic value system</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.650" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">I think natural laws more fully fleshed out in sort of Greek</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.110" end="00:38:35.799" style="s2">teleological sense when when they talk about the idea that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:41.320" style="s2">Aristotle Plato when they talk about the idea that you can look at the world around you and discover the purposes of the world around</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.320" end="00:38:44.199" style="s2">You simply by using reason well in the in the genetic sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.200" end="00:38:50.439" style="s2">There&#39;s the idea that God abides by the moral code that he himself created and you can ask him questions about it</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:56.620" style="s2">In fact, the very name Israel is in in Hebrew Sorrell. Yes, sir. I&#39;ll literally means struggle with God. Yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.810" end="00:39:07.449" style="s2">That there is this and that&#39;s a remarkable that&#39;s a remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.060" end="00:39:13.629" style="s2">Story that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s Jacob. I always get Jacob and Joseph confess</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.660" end="00:39:16.660" style="s2">It&#39;s Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.140" end="00:39:24.340" style="s2">The other side of the river so he hasn&#39;t crossed back to his homeland right he hasn&#39;t returned home after his hero&#39;s journey</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.650" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">He sent his wife and his children and his belongings</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.040" end="00:39:32.499" style="s2">ahead to try to make peace with the brother that he&#39;s seriously betrayed and</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.930" end="00:39:36.190" style="s2">And he&#39;s had his adventures and maybe he&#39;s learned his lessons</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.350" end="00:39:42.370" style="s2">But then he&#39;s on the bank the river and he&#39;s visited by an angel who appears to be gone and he wrestles with him all</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.370" end="00:39:47.859" style="s2">night, and he comes out damaged, right which is an indication that this sort of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:55.269" style="s2">Egyptian idea when Horus encounters Seth and has his eye torn out that there&#39;s some high</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.790" end="00:40:01.060" style="s2">Probability of damage that if you encounter the divine even even in some positive sense</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:08.199" style="s2">but he wrestles with him all night and then defeats God apparently in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.600" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">and is allowed to move forward with his adventure and then is given this new name and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.330" end="00:40:18.189" style="s2">The name really struck me when I started thinking about it because what it does imply</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.190" end="00:40:26.109" style="s2">I think this is such a positive message and I don&#39;t know how to reconcile it precisely with it Jewish claim of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.499" end="00:40:33.279" style="s2">chosen us as a people because my reading of the of that particular text seemed to imply that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.890" end="00:40:41.349" style="s2">The chosen people are precisely those who do in fact wrestle with God and so that they take these ethical questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.539" end="00:40:43.539" style="s2">Seriously, they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.959" end="00:40:50.049" style="s2">Accepting them without question and without thought because there&#39;s no wrestling there</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.390" end="00:40:55.569" style="s2">right, but the real morality comes in the in this struggle between the revelation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.089" end="00:41:00.188" style="s2">And and and and and the freedom for thought and choice</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.189" end="00:41:00.849" style="s2">I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.849" end="00:41:04.869" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s a beautiful idea and one of the things that&#39;s fascinating about that is if you read the rest of the book</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.869" end="00:41:11.379" style="s2">Of Genesis every time in Genesis somebody&#39;s name is changed because there are several name changes right aber Abram it becomes Abraham</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.900" end="00:41:18.849" style="s2">Sir, I becomes Sarah there there are several points at which there are angels who come and basically change the name or God changes somebody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.849" end="00:41:26.078" style="s2">Name that&#39;s their name going forward when Jacob is returned Israel. He is not called Israel consistently from there to the end of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.779" end="00:41:32.109" style="s2">Death he the names are used at different times. So sometimes he&#39;s Israel. And sometimes he&#39;s Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.109" end="00:41:33.890" style="s2">So the idea there is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.890" end="00:41:35.269" style="s2">Sometimes he is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.269" end="00:41:41.109" style="s2">The best version of himself that the version of self who struggles with morality who struggles with God who tries to come up with proper</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.109" end="00:41:46.448" style="s2">Solutions and sometimes he&#39;s still the old Jacob the old Jacob who ran away from Esau and who served seven years</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.819" end="00:41:49.478" style="s2">Unjustly under Laban and all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.479" end="00:41:49.759" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.759" end="00:41:55.238" style="s2">It&#39;s really fascinating one of my favorites home eunuch stories that this has been deeply embedded in Judaea tradition for a long time the idea</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.239" end="00:41:59.228" style="s2">of struggling with God and struggling with the dictates of morality because</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.390" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">Part of Jewish tradition is of course the idea of the oral tradition the idea that we were given a written document on Sinai</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:11.499" style="s2">But then there was an oral tradition that was also passed along to Moses. That was the interpretation of the written tradition</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.869" end="00:42:18.758" style="s2">Which in some ways maybe a backfilled justification, but I think that there&#39;s a fundamental truth to it</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.769" end="00:42:21.938" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s a segment that I quote in the book from the Talmud</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.939" end="00:42:23.209" style="s2">It&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.209" end="00:42:24.469" style="s2">amazing story where</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.469" end="00:42:29.799" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s part of these sort of apocryphal stories what they call the Agha Tata and tell me you to in tome you to parlance</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.900" end="00:42:36.189" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s a story where there&#39;s a rabbi who is in an argument with a bunch of other rabbis about a particular point of Halawa</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.339" end="00:42:39.399" style="s2">Of Jewish law and this rabbi is arguing</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.460" end="00:42:42.189" style="s2">He said the rabbi&#39;s and the other rabbis vote one way and he votes the other way</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.190" end="00:42:47.169" style="s2">So he loses and the rabbi who loses says listen, I know I&#39;m right not only do I know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.170" end="00:42:52.149" style="s2">I&#39;m right if I&#39;m right let the walls of this the walls of this this synagogue</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.700" end="00:42:56.379" style="s2">close in around us so the walls starts to lean in and then the rabbi said</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.380" end="00:43:00.490" style="s2">You know what? That&#39;s not evidence. That doesn&#39;t show that you&#39;re right. It just shows that the walls were closing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.490" end="00:43:04.659" style="s2">He says well, you know if I&#39;m right then let the river outside start to flow backwards</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.660" end="00:43:08.710" style="s2">So the river starts to flow backwards and the rabbi&#39;s insights. It&#39;s still not evidence. We&#39;re not gonna take that</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.710" end="00:43:13.540" style="s2">he says well if I&#39;m right let there be a Bott call that there be the voice of God literally come down from heaven and</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.540" end="00:43:15.110" style="s2">say that I&#39;m right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.110" end="00:43:22.030" style="s2">sure enough a voice from heaven comes down and says that he&#39;s right and the and the other members of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.370" end="00:43:24.820" style="s2">Parliament the other members of the Sanhedrin they say to him</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:30.249" style="s2">You know what none of that counts because God gave us a rule and the rule is that we have a majority rule in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.250" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">Body right here. And so our interpretation is correct, and yours is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:40.239" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t matter what miracles you bring to to show that your side is right and the conclusion of the story is that God says</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.610" end="00:43:42.430" style="s2">One of the Angels asked God about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.430" end="00:43:46.629" style="s2">And God says my children have defeated me and the idea is that God is happy about this</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.630" end="00:43:51.880" style="s2">God wants us to use our reason to take those fundamental principles that he gave us and then develop those across time</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.880" end="00:43:53.880" style="s2">That&#39;s how you get development. I</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.360" end="00:44:03.490" style="s2">Would also interpret this to some degree from a psychological perspective, you know, because and this this might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.450" end="00:44:11.320" style="s2">Far-fetched speculation, but I don&#39;t think that it precisely is. I mean, I do believe that our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.960" end="00:44:13.960" style="s2">structures our cognitive function are</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.510" end="00:44:21.939" style="s2">Embedded in narrative that seems to be a right hemisphere function and that the right hemisphere is the source of intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.130" end="00:44:24.130" style="s2">Revelation now whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.590" end="00:44:30.820" style="s2">Metaphysical implications that have that has I have no idea. I also know that you know many</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:34.479" style="s2">religious experiences seem to be characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.510" end="00:44:41.829" style="s2">Preferential activity in the right hemisphere. So there&#39;s something very strange going on in the right hemisphere and then we have a left hemisphere. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.470" end="00:44:44.649" style="s2">argumentative and parliamentary and logical and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.260" end="00:44:47.230" style="s2">Obviously in order for us to make our way in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.230" end="00:44:53.139" style="s2">We have to have a continual dialogue between the intuitive axioms that are offered to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:55.290" style="s2">spontaneously in our</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.290" end="00:45:01.970" style="s2">imagination by the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere who does a critical analysis and tries to lay that out in some logical and</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.220" end="00:45:05.809" style="s2">And and let&#39;s say logical and algorithmic manner</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.180" end="00:45:13.009" style="s2">but the left can collapse into a kind of unthinking tyranny as a consequence of that and the right without that corrective can</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.560" end="00:45:20.420" style="s2">what would you say stray too far down imaginative paths and no longer be applicable to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.760" end="00:45:22.760" style="s2">fundamental day-to-day problems of the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.070" end="00:45:25.070" style="s2">so we need that balance and</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.260" end="00:45:31.880" style="s2">and it is a strange thing that we have these two hemispheres which implies that we need two ways of looking at the world and</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.980" end="00:45:34.069" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s unreasonable to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.410" end="00:45:42.259" style="s2">Look at the relationship between that and then assess atif or something like the revelation of intuition and the corrective power of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.960" end="00:45:45.139" style="s2">But you can&#39;t dispense with the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:51.080" style="s2">It seems to do something like ground you in the world and to provide you with your fundamental axioms. I</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.020" end="00:45:52.790" style="s2">Think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.790" end="00:45:53.420" style="s2">and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.420" end="00:45:59.239" style="s2">that seems to me how an enormous amount of scientific discovery takes place is you people have a flash of intuition and then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.240" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">Question of them and that&#39;s how you come up with a hypothesis. Right? Well</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.940" end="00:46:05.899" style="s2">They often backfield too, you know like right</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.600" end="00:46:08.600" style="s2">scientific journal</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.240" end="00:46:12.290" style="s2">Outlines how you came to your hypothesis through a</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:15.559" style="s2">process of rational deduction</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.380" end="00:46:22.609" style="s2">Step by step, right, but that isn&#39;t what happens. What happens is you have a hunch of some sort and often</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.610" end="00:46:27.079" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen this especially with intuitive scientists. They have a hunch that actually sounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.720" end="00:46:34.489" style="s2">Irrational when they first put it forward and sometimes it takes them months or even years to backfill that</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.010" end="00:46:41.450" style="s2">Intuition with the rationality that&#39;s necessary to communicate its integrity to other scientists</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.450" end="00:46:47.389" style="s2">And so the the narrative that&#39;s written in the scientific document is actually a kind of well</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:49.759" style="s2">It&#39;s a kind of formal. I wouldn&#39;t call it a deception</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.970" end="00:46:56.329" style="s2">It&#39;s a formalization but it&#39;s also predicated on the assumption that it&#39;s linear rational thinking that leads to these</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.180" end="00:47:02.419" style="s2">Intuitive hypotheses, and sometimes that&#39;s the case, especially if it&#39;s incremental change</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.670" end="00:47:08.029" style="s2">But those major leaps forward are like the introduction of new alternative axioms</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.030" end="00:47:10.969" style="s2">And then they have to be tested by rationality</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.850" end="00:47:16.699" style="s2">Yeah, I think that&#39;s exactly right. I think that&#39;s also the story of history that you have these intuitive leaps</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.700" end="00:47:17.540" style="s2">And yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.540" end="00:47:19.909" style="s2">There&#39;s a history to those intuitive leaps and you do have to have both</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.119" end="00:47:25.429" style="s2">You&#39;d have to understand the history of those intuitive leaps and you also have to understand what an intuitive leap has actually taken place</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.430" end="00:47:27.470" style="s2">I think he make that argument about revelation</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.470" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">I think frankly you can make that argument maybe about the Enlightenment that there&#39;s some intuitive leaps going on</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.929" style="s2">But those intuitive leaps have a history and don&#39;t exist in the absence of the backstory</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.930" end="00:47:43.070" style="s2">so the intuitive leap of the enlightenment at large part at least politically seemed to me to be the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.590" end="00:47:44.820" style="s2">full</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.820" end="00:47:49.129" style="s2">articulation of the idea that the human being made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.770" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">had</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:55.189" style="s2">intrinsic worth that transcended that which was being</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.369" end="00:48:02.149" style="s2">Allowed under the feudal system. You see that first. I would say in the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.030" end="00:48:04.290" style="s2">Renaissance art</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.290" end="00:48:11.389" style="s2">Because what you see is the divine figures for example marry in Christ to take a single example or to take two</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.670" end="00:48:15.950" style="s2">Particular examples start to remove themselves from their iconic</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.500" end="00:48:23.750" style="s2">representation and become genuine individuals and so that&#39;s uh, that&#39;s a bringing down of the divine to earth, but it&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.630" end="00:48:30.740" style="s2">Elevation of the individual right is that these were real people they were like us and at the same time you see this</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.410" end="00:48:33.500" style="s2">spread of the idea that well</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.500" end="00:48:35.959" style="s2">Each individual is sovereign and worthwhile</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.960" end="00:48:41.600" style="s2">And I do think it&#39;s out of that that comes eventually the powerful anti-slavery movies</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.060" end="00:48:44.060" style="s2">movements and the demand for</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.630" end="00:48:47.630" style="s2">Universal suffrage</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.820" end="00:48:49.410" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.410" end="00:48:50.420" style="s2">That&#39;s exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.420" end="00:48:56.300" style="s2">I mean and this is the part where I become rather perturbed when people suggest that the the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.580" end="00:49:01.639" style="s2">Evils of Western civilization are unique while the goods are Universal. This is this is the part of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.640" end="00:49:06.980" style="s2">I&#39;ve never understood from people who are highly critical of Western civilization. They point out correctly that</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:13.340" style="s2">Western civilization has been responsible for an immense amount of evil there. There&#39;s tremendous racism endemic in Western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.350" end="00:49:18.559" style="s2">There&#39;s there&#39;s religious persecution. Obviously, there&#39;s genocide against you know, my extended family</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.560" end="00:49:24.469" style="s2">I mean this sort of stuff was part Western civilization it is but here&#39;s what makes Western civilization different</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.599" end="00:49:28.788" style="s2">All of those things exist in virtually every other culture throughout the vast span of time</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.950" end="00:49:31.909" style="s2">the good stuff is the part that we don&#39;t have a really good explanation for</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.039" end="00:49:36.109" style="s2">The good stuff is the part where we have to say. Okay, what drove all the good stuff to happen? Because</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.180" end="00:49:45.649" style="s2">Unlikely well like one of the things I can&#39;t understand this is a real mystery to meat man, and I can&#39;t explain it except</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.130" end="00:49:49.130" style="s2">And maybe this is an intuitive idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.619" end="00:49:56.358" style="s2">because I haven&#39;t laid it out as well as I might have but one of the things I cannot understand is how any</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.760" end="00:50:03.799" style="s2">Countries escaped absolute corruption because most of the countries in the world are absolutely corrupt. The police are corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.799" end="00:50:08.839" style="s2">The politicians are corrupt. The unions are corrupt. The corporations are corrupt. The currency is corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:14.059" style="s2">The day-to-day interactions between people are corrupt and and in the really corrupt countries</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.059" end="00:50:19.788" style="s2">The interactions between family members are corrupt, you know, so you get situations like well East Germany</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.789" end="00:50:26.869" style="s2">Which is a bit anachronistic now where you know one out of three people were government informers. It&#39;s like and corruption is easy, man</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.180" end="00:50:31.399" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the Hobbesian way of the world</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.650" end="00:50:37.819" style="s2">but then there&#39;s a handful of countries and I would include Japan and South Korea among those that where</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.160" end="00:50:44.270" style="s2">Corruption isn&#39;t the fundamental rule where Trust is the fundamental rule, right?</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.270" end="00:50:47.629" style="s2">I can&#39;t see how that could have manifested itself</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.299" end="00:50:51.349" style="s2">except within the confines of a religious</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.049" end="00:50:54.919" style="s2">belief system that insisted above all on</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.010" end="00:51:02.779" style="s2">The enactment of a higher moral ethic right something outside of politics something outside of self-interest</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.789" end="00:51:05.569" style="s2">It&#39;s a weak argument because I still don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.569" end="00:51:11.149" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see how a country can make that transition from fundamental corruption to honesty</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.150" end="00:51:17.450" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s an absolute miracle as far as I&#39;m concerned and a number of countries have managed that and they are</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.700" end="00:51:22.490" style="s2">Almost all are either West Western countries or highly westernized countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.400" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">yeah, I mean, I I think that&#39;s exactly right and it&#39;s also when you examine different places on earth what you see</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:32.778" style="s2">Is that the social fabric is going to decide the character of the country?</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.779" end="00:51:35.149" style="s2">And this is why when people start saying well</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.150" end="00:51:40.070" style="s2">We should apply nordic solutions in the united states and say well is our culture the same as the Nordic culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.560" end="00:51:44.299" style="s2">Because maybe that solution is not going to work. I mean these sort of one-size-fits-all</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.340" end="00:52:20.840" style="s2">Well, that&#39;s also part of the reason that I made the argument constantly to Harris and other atheists that I&#39;ve talked to that</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:23.780" style="s2">They&#39;re judeo-christian whether they know it or not, right?</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.780" end="00:52:31.369" style="s2">And the reason for that is that all of their embodied actions presuppose the judeo-christian ethic. The only thing that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.420" end="00:52:35.420" style="s2">Religious about them is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.820" end="00:52:37.260" style="s2">articulated</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.260" end="00:52:38.970" style="s2">post-enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.970" end="00:52:45.709" style="s2">Rational representation of the world and I do think you see that in Harris quite frequently because he does believe in evil</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.810" end="00:52:47.430" style="s2">He does really good</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.430" end="00:52:54.230" style="s2">he believes that the proper way of proceeding in the world is to move from evil towards good and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.840" end="00:52:56.490" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.490" end="00:52:57.020" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.020" end="00:53:02.179" style="s2">I&#39;ve had the exactly the same conversation with Sam in and he it was it&#39;s been a bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.460" end="00:53:06.679" style="s2">Conversation even on the notion of objective truth so Sam, it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.680" end="00:53:09.230" style="s2">so you and Sam and I I would say that I&#39;m as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.540" end="00:53:16.340" style="s2">Religious person more closely aligned with Sam&#39;s vision of what objective truth is and you&#39;re sort of American pragmatist Perce</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.590" end="00:53:22.759" style="s2">Version of what objective truth is and with that said, I don&#39;t know where Sam is getting his version, right?</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.760" end="00:53:28.249" style="s2">I&#39;m getting my version from the idea that God created an objective truth that the mind of man can ferret out from time to time</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.430" end="00:53:30.430" style="s2">and Sam&#39;s version is</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.810" end="00:53:37.999" style="s2">What like I just don&#39;t understand how evolutionary biology results in anything remotely approaching the idea that an objective truth is possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.090" end="00:53:45.679" style="s2">I see evolutionarily beneficial stuff happening right that if you if you come up with an idea that makes your species more likely to predominate</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.900" end="00:53:51.379" style="s2">Then you hold by that but that doesn&#39;t make it objectively true. It makes it objectively useful which is a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.380" end="00:53:57.589" style="s2">I also don&#39;t see how it&#39;s a straightforward matter to get from reliance on evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.930" end="00:54:03.559" style="s2">say as your fundamental way of orienting yourself with regards to reality the world and something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.440" end="00:54:10.339" style="s2">The primacy of rationality and the ability to extract out from that rationality something</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.530" end="00:54:15.739" style="s2">Approximating a universal morality. I can&#39;t see most these three things fitting together at all</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.740" end="00:54:21.260" style="s2">This is right. And even even Sam&#39;s moral standard, which is generalized to man flourishing. There&#39;s a lot of play in those joints</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.260" end="00:54:22.849" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve asked him several times</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.849" end="00:54:27.859" style="s2">I was on my Sunday special and I asked him to define human flourishing and I was pointing out to him that the vast majority</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.859" end="00:54:31.279" style="s2">Of human beings disagree on the very nature of what bets firm constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.319" end="00:54:34.819" style="s2">If you if you talk to religious people about what human flourishing constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.819" end="00:54:37.609" style="s2">They&#39;re not going to tell you about all of the nice stuff they have in their house</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.609" end="00:54:40.909" style="s2">They&#39;re gonna tell you about their ability to teach the religious precepts to their kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.910" end="00:54:44.329" style="s2">if you&#39;re talking about human flourishing on an evolutionary level and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:50.150" style="s2">Presumably that would assume us having more kids rather than fewer kids and in developed countries, we have fewer kids rather than more kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.150" end="00:54:56.750" style="s2">So what exactly is the standard for human flourishing other than sort of what sim likes I?</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.440" end="00:55:00.440" style="s2">Think part of the way that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.500" end="00:55:07.459" style="s2">Circumvents that problem is that is by pointing out that it might be possible for us to agree on what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.460" end="00:55:15.829" style="s2">Unnecessary human suffering and to work for the opposite of that like it it makes it kind of right and we agree on cruelty</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.829" end="00:55:17.829" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.630" end="00:55:20.480" style="s2">And that&#39;s why we even agree on that is the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.480" end="00:55:25.520" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure that we agree on that either because it&#39;s not like there&#39;s been any shortage of</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.220" end="00:55:29.209" style="s2">high cruelty warrior cultures in the past</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.210" end="00:55:31.210" style="s2">I mean it was certainly the case with Rome</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.559" end="00:55:37.699" style="s2">Right or or cruelty on behalf of a greater good right. You could easily make the case for cruelty on behalf of human flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.700" end="00:55:41.210" style="s2">I mean Hitler did it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an evil case. That&#39;s the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.460" end="00:55:45.319" style="s2">Okay, that&#39;s the that was the case of communism that you break a few eggs to make an omelet</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.530" end="00:55:50.209" style="s2">That is the higher human flourishing is the root is the interest of the majority. It&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.420" end="00:55:57.649" style="s2">Not rational, I mean one of the things I really liked about the Solzhenitsyn&#39;s book The Gulag Archipelago was that you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.650" end="00:56:03.980" style="s2">He makes this he makes an anti enlightenment case in a very matter because he says well look</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.020" end="00:56:09.020" style="s2">Here&#39;s four or five axioms or six or seven axioms. They&#39;re derived directly from Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.460" end="00:56:17.389" style="s2">If you accept those and then you act rationally as a consequence of your excite those</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.910" end="00:56:24.560" style="s2">axioms and of course the Marxists would claim that those axioms were derived by rational means that all you get is something</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.260" end="00:56:27.260" style="s2">approximating all hell breaking loose and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.540" end="00:56:31.999" style="s2">So what&#39;s to be the case is that there is a necessary set of underlying axioms</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:39.619" style="s2">And I do believe they&#39;re coded properly in the judeo-christian ethic that if you then act upon rationally you get something approximating</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.320" end="00:56:44.689" style="s2">Whatever progress we&#39;ve managed to make and a promise is substantive</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:50.299" style="s2">Yep, totally agree. And this is effectively the case that I&#39;m making in the book</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.300" end="00:56:54.259" style="s2">I think that the big difference we have right now in civilization is the difference that was first articulated</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.600" end="00:56:59.749" style="s2">I think beautifully by GK Chesterton in in his sort of contrast between left and right his</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.300" end="00:57:05.179" style="s2">Analogy and it&#39;s a beautiful metaphor is that you&#39;re walking through a forest and you come across a wall</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.180" end="00:57:08.629" style="s2">It&#39;s just this old archaic wall old stone wall. You don&#39;t know why it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.630" end="00:57:11.930" style="s2">If you&#39;re on the left, your first instinct is I don&#39;t know why this wall is here</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.940" end="00:57:14.480" style="s2">Probably I should tear this wall out because why is the wall here?</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.480" end="00:57:22.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the person on the right the kind of conservative or traditional person the traditionally minded person their first instinct is I</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.500" end="00:57:26.270" style="s2">Don&#39;t know why this wall is here. I&#39;m gonna go try and find out why the wall is here</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.270" end="00:57:29.570" style="s2">And then maybe I&#39;ll think about tearing it out. Mm-hmm. And that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.270" end="00:57:34.520" style="s2">The case I&#39;m making I think with regard to what our civilization there are</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.950" end="00:57:40.280" style="s2">Foundational things in our civilization that maybe it&#39;s possible to remove that particular Jenga block and everything stands</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.280" end="00:57:43.280" style="s2">But I&#39;m not gonna pretend that just because I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.530" end="00:57:48.889" style="s2">the reason for this particular revelatory principle at the revelatory principle isn&#39;t important and</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.990" end="00:57:54.080" style="s2">Undergirding and therefore a reason and put there by people who are just as smart as I was there&#39;s a certain arrogance to two people</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.180" end="00:57:56.899" style="s2">Who are living now that they were much smarter than people who came before?</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.119" end="00:58:00.259" style="s2">No, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re standing on those people&#39;s shoulders so you can see a little bit further</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.260" end="00:58:04.189" style="s2">But the truth is that they were probably seven-foot. You&#39;re probably a 4-footer. Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.190" end="00:58:10.129" style="s2">well, it&#39;s definitely the case that my intellectual attitude changed quite substantially when I decided that I was going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.220" end="00:58:12.330" style="s2">risk</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.330" end="00:58:16.789" style="s2">Taking the religious texts that I was studying with some degree of seriousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.220" end="00:58:22.789" style="s2">Mike and I came to that through Solzhenitsyn and young I would say fundamentally because they made a strong case for</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.579" end="00:58:25.579" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:29.510" style="s2">Let&#39;s say they made a strong case that there were</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.410" end="00:58:32.789" style="s2">Presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.789" end="00:58:36.109" style="s2">Encoded in those narratives in a dreamlike manner</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.690" end="00:58:43.250" style="s2">Same way that Piaget did that we couldn&#39;t do without and that we should be very careful in</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.500" end="00:58:45.500" style="s2">dispensing with them in that a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.869" end="00:58:51.858" style="s2">arrogant rational manner so that you you treat you start by treating the text with a certain amount of reverence and</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.230" end="00:58:54.589" style="s2">You with a certain amount of ignorance, right?</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.589" end="00:58:58.279" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s something here that you don&#39;t understand and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.680" end="00:59:04.220" style="s2">should probably assume that it&#39;s worthwhile because it&#39;s being being kept rather than to leap to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.950" end="00:59:10.369" style="s2">Proposition that you and your ignorance can clearly see why it&#39;s unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.099" end="00:59:17.239" style="s2">Yeah, and and I think that the greatest impact the the saddest part of this. Is that the greatest impact in terms of throwing away</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.150" end="00:59:19.829" style="s2">the the stories of</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.829" end="00:59:24.469" style="s2">our heritage basically is that that impact is generally not going to be felt in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.630" end="00:59:29.359" style="s2">urban centers with people who go to Sam&#39;s lectures or listen to his podcast those people have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.809" end="00:59:37.849" style="s2">worldview that they have shaped by listening to stuff like Sam&#39;s or or Steven Pinker&#39;s or Richard Dawkins and</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.039" end="00:59:42.709" style="s2">That worldview. Well, I think it may not be fully coherent it coheres for them</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.710" end="00:59:46.579" style="s2">but the problem is that you apply that to people whose main draw to</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.799" end="00:59:47.430" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.430" end="00:59:53.930" style="s2">morality is not going to come from listening to these particular sources the people who got their social fabric from churches in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.930" end="00:59:59.029" style="s2">The country in the United States the people who have built a social fabric along with their neighbors because they have a commonly oriented goal</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.029" end="01:00:03.619" style="s2">And then you take that away from them and you offer them go find your own purpose. Good luck with that. Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.349" end="01:00:08.419" style="s2">That&#39;s right. They&#39;re not going to turn into fully fledged</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.359" end="01:00:10.710" style="s2">humanistic</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.710" end="01:00:15.589" style="s2">Positively thinking enlightenment types merely as a consequence of abandoning</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.589" end="01:00:22.399" style="s2">The religious superstitions is exactly the thing that that the Enlightenment types I think are</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.400" end="01:00:24.900" style="s2">naive about</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.900" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">Its now and then to build up is is is sort of the way that I put it to see em</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.820" style="s2">Yes, you can tear apart my religious tradition and you can probably do so in an entertaining way</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.820" end="01:00:37.779" style="s2">I mean you do obviously and then how are you gonna build? What exactly are you building?</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.820" end="01:00:41.289" style="s2">You know and and I can do the same thing to to your worldview</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.290" end="01:00:43.629" style="s2">But then what am I building the question is going to be?</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.600" end="01:00:50.169" style="s2">What are the foundational we&#39;re not we&#39;re not standing. We&#39;re not standing up. We&#39;re not standing on the first floor of the building</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.170" end="01:00:52.070" style="s2">We are standing on the top floor of a building</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.070" end="01:00:55.899" style="s2">you can&#39;t go at the bottom floor with jackhammers and then expected the top story is just gonna</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.670" end="01:01:08.860" style="s2">Well, look, um, I promised that I&#39;d let you be at 1:15, and it&#39;s 1:25</p>

<p begin="01:01:55.070" end="01:01:59.830" style="s2">Developmental precursor. I think that&#39;s an it&#39;s you know, the only thing that&#39;s remarkable to me about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.830" end="01:02:02.889" style="s2">is that the people so many of the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.320" end="01:02:07.899" style="s2">Enlightenment types like Pinker and Hitchens and Harris are also evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.600" end="01:02:09.890" style="s2">biologists and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.890" end="01:02:12.040" style="s2">Jesus they should know better man. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.680" end="01:02:18.460" style="s2">even people like Fran&#39;s de Waal, you know, it&#39;s been studied chimpanzee behavior has shown very clearly the</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.190" end="01:02:24.310" style="s2">Evolutionary origins of a rather profound proto morality. So even you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.070" end="01:02:31.299" style="s2">Looking at this from the perspective of divine revelation, whatever that might be and that&#39;s a great mystery, you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.300" end="01:02:37.029" style="s2">Because I think often divine revelation is the revelation of our true nature to ourselves and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.030" end="01:02:40.009" style="s2">That might be metaphysically mediated god only knows</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.650" end="01:02:43.430" style="s2">But there&#39;s a lengthy developmental history</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.430" end="01:02:46.430" style="s2">preceding the development of anything like</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:53.690" style="s2">Fundamental moral assumptions and the evolutionary biology seems to support that presupposition</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.570" end="01:02:56.570" style="s2">powerfully, and so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.330" end="01:03:03.979" style="s2">contradiction in the Enlightenment viewpoint that I just don&#39;t get it&#39;s like well as far as you&#39;re concerned as an evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.740" end="01:03:07.160" style="s2">Everything has a history. That should be</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.770" end="01:03:14.630" style="s2">Marked off in the hundreds of millions or at least the tens of millions of years and yet this radically important</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.090" end="01:03:19.819" style="s2">Transformation in the manner in which human beings conducted themselves. Well, that was just something that emerged</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.340" end="01:03:25.759" style="s2">Out of nothing, right? It&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so funny because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.310" end="01:03:27.860" style="s2">ex nihilo</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.860" end="01:03:29.860" style="s2">I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.290" end="01:03:33.290" style="s2">Argument it&#39;s like well we were ignorant</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.530" end="01:03:35.880" style="s2">Feudalistic</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.880" end="01:03:38.539" style="s2">Christians squabbling among each other in this</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.180" end="01:03:42.349" style="s2">superstitious morass and all of a sudden out of nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.570" end="01:03:47.900" style="s2">in some sense came this brilliant new way of looking at the world, and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:53.870" style="s2">See how that&#39;s in keeping with that deeper view of history that&#39;s necessary if you&#39;re an evolutionary biologist</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.230" end="01:04:02.090" style="s2">Yeah, I obviously agree totally with that and I find it kind of hilarious. So a lot of the presuppositions that are made are</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.820" end="01:04:07.820" style="s2">fundamentally at odds with a lot of the other presuppositions that are that are that undergird the system of thought when you see</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.820" end="01:04:14.630" style="s2">You know, I was talking to Pinker just recently really like two weeks ago and I broke this topic, you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.630" end="01:04:18.470" style="s2">he did agree, by the way to have a three-way discussion with you and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.710" end="01:04:22.460" style="s2">Yeah, I mean I&#39;d totally be interested in that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.460" end="01:04:23.130" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.130" end="01:04:28.970" style="s2">talk to the CA people and we&#39;re gonna try to set it up because I centigrate I think that would be great and we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.970" end="01:04:32.899" style="s2">We could we could see what you see. We&#39;ll have an all right festival. That&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.970" end="01:04:37.970" style="s2">Is now everybody&#39;s all right if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.430" end="01:04:44.119" style="s2">To Jews to Jews in a self-help in Canadian</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.210" end="01:04:52.789" style="s2">It would be C because one of the things that struck me so interestingly about</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.090" end="01:04:57.140" style="s2">the last time I talked to him was as soon as I broached the argument that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.720" end="01:04:59.720" style="s2">these Enlightenment ideas were</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.420" end="01:05:02.449" style="s2">founded in something that looked like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.300" end="01:05:06.289" style="s2">metaphysical religious narrative, whatever its origins</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.290" end="01:05:13.249" style="s2">All he did was point to all the negative examples of what religious structures have</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.740" end="01:05:19.550" style="s2">Managed and right that seems to be to be such an unfair argument because it&#39;s an avoidance argument again</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.650" end="01:05:21.390" style="s2">Then that&#39;s also stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.390" end="01:05:28.009" style="s2">Non religious structures have created like that&#39;s that&#39;s the the question is not why bad stuff happens in religious society</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.010" end="01:05:30.010" style="s2">The question is why good stuff at all?</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.060" end="01:05:35.749" style="s2">Yes, that is the question is specially given that it&#39;s it&#39;s inappropriate to conflate</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.570" end="01:05:39.499" style="s2">religious structures with tribalism, correct, you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.500" end="01:05:42.830" style="s2">Especially because you can you can look I mean you might want to blame</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.170" end="01:05:49.699" style="s2">Human evil on the proclivity for us to gather together in groups under a religious hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.130" end="01:05:56.989" style="s2">But then you&#39;re stuck with the problem of chimpanzees who do exactly the same thing with the equivalent degree of brutality</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.330" end="01:05:59.330" style="s2">With no religious thinking whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.330" end="01:06:06.199" style="s2">And so I think it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to point out that religious thinking can become a variant of tribalism</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.360" end="01:06:08.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s no more fair to</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.030" end="01:06:10.560" style="s2">blame</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.560" end="01:06:11.820" style="s2">human social</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.820" end="01:06:14.749" style="s2">conflict on religion than it is to blame the existence of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.940" end="01:06:15.690" style="s2">hierarchy on</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.690" end="01:06:20.510" style="s2">Capitalism the greatest tribalism that I&#39;m seeing it in today&#39;s world has not only nothing to do with religion</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.510" end="01:06:27.290" style="s2">But is actively anti religion or the greatest tribalism that I&#39;m seeing right now whether you&#39;re talking about the intersection or left that creates</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.450" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">Hierarchies of value based on your group membership or whether you&#39;re talking about the white supremacists</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:32.060" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.060" end="01:06:39.830" style="s2">which is militantly anti-christian and sees Christianity and Judaism by extension as as a weakness that that</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.680" end="01:06:46.009" style="s2">That&#39;s pure tribalism white supremacy has nothing to do with overarching religious instincts</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.010" end="01:06:48.620" style="s2">In fact, it says that overarching religious instinct is quite bad</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.690" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">one of the great anti tribal forces in human history has been the presence of</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.770" end="01:06:55.160" style="s2">Religion is a point that Robert Putnam makes in Bowling Alone</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.440" end="01:07:00.950" style="s2">he were pretty supposed that diversity was our strength as the as the Nostrum goes and</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.410" end="01:07:07.369" style="s2">He then found that ethnic diversity in a vacuum doesn&#39;t actually create strength it creates</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.280" end="01:07:09.480" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.480" end="01:07:12.109" style="s2">What he said is the only two things you get with pure ethnic diversity</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.180" end="01:07:18.379" style="s2">Are increased protests marches and increased television watching but if you have a common purpose if you have a common purpose a common</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.630" end="01:07:24.650" style="s2">Reason for being together then ethnic diversity and experiential diversity is our strength and it&#39;s really great, right?</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.650" end="01:07:29.389" style="s2">there you go to a church and you see diverse group of people all of whom came from different places and they all care for</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.390" end="01:07:33.470" style="s2">each other and they&#39;re all taking care of each other and they all have different stories to tell and enriching stories to tell</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.599" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">That&#39;s how you build the society</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.849" end="01:07:40.399" style="s2">To play the same axiomatic game exam is predicated on these underlying</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.310" end="01:07:48.679" style="s2">Revelatory truths the most important of which as you pointed out is the notion that human beings are made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.810" end="01:07:52.369" style="s2">which which you know, it&#39;s one of the things because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.050" end="01:07:59.810" style="s2">You know, I tend never to take a religious view if I could take a scientific view I</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.480" end="01:08:07.339" style="s2">Never take a metaphysical view if I could take a reductionist view, you know, it&#39;s a form of Mental Hygiene in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.740" end="01:08:11.449" style="s2">but there are statements there are biblical statements that are so</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.970" end="01:08:16.219" style="s2">Unlikely that it&#39;s very difficult for me to account for them</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.130" end="01:08:22.160" style="s2">reductionistic aliy or even biologically even though I&#39;ve done my best to do so and that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.739" end="01:08:28.279" style="s2">Well the idea that you extract the best out of the chaos of potential with truth</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.529" end="01:08:29.719" style="s2">That&#39;s one man</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.719" end="01:08:37.249" style="s2">Because that is one daring metaphysical statement and that requires a tremendous amount of courage to even attempt and I do believe that it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.799" end="01:08:41.089" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s not the most true thing. That&#39;s ever been written</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.279" end="01:08:48.229" style="s2">But then a close contender would be the one that you identified which is well men and women are made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.560" end="01:08:55.430" style="s2">It&#39;s like who the hell would have thought that up? But as much it&#39;s such a it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so crazily</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.049" end="01:09:00.289" style="s2">Irrational in a sense it flies in the face of</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.630" end="01:09:07.910" style="s2">Everything that you see about human beings are virtually everything that you see about them. They&#39;re hierarchical arrangement their relative weakness their mortality</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.130" end="01:09:10.880" style="s2">They&#39;re flawed nature their sinful nature</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.460" end="01:09:14.120" style="s2">You know their their their their innumerable</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.700" end="01:09:18.919" style="s2">Inadequacies and then to say in spite of all that so long ago</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.500" end="01:09:23.459" style="s2">And at the beginning of this civilizing tradition that well. Yeah, despite all that</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.339" end="01:09:26.290" style="s2">self-evident</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.290" end="01:09:33.240" style="s2">Pathology and radical individual difference in power and ability that each of us has a divine spark</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:35.520" style="s2">It&#39;s like ha</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.490" end="01:09:40.859" style="s2">It isn&#39;t it&#39;s an amazing thought and it&#39;s an inspiring thought and I hope that at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.859" end="01:09:44.039" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s if we&#39;re gonna take away one message from I think this</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.170" end="01:09:48.690" style="s2">Conversation and in general if loons had one message out to the world the idea that you&#39;re made in the image of God</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.690" end="01:09:54.180" style="s2">And so is everybody else if we build on that? I think we can build something. That&#39;s an excellent place to end</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.030" end="01:09:56.910" style="s2">Well, thanks so much. I really appreciate it Orden</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.910" end="01:10:01.439" style="s2">it&#39;s really good to talk to you Ben and get with your book and I hope it has the effect that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.540" end="01:10:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re hoping for I hope that we can that we can make a</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.200" end="01:10:11.279" style="s2">Strong case especially with the Enlightenment types and and even the atheists to some degree. I hope so</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.280" end="01:10:13.320" style="s2">I think that in the end we can all be on the same page</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.390" end="01:10:20.129" style="s2">But I think they&#39;re gonna have to recognize the the value of tradition just as we respect the value of reason great</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.440" end="01:10:24.450" style="s2">Right. Awesome. It&#39;s a sword. Okay, man, II love to see it. I see</p>
