<p begin="00:19:32.560" end="00:19:37.180" style="s2">for basically pasta or for any</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.020" end="00:19:39.760" style="s2">mindfulness practice is the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.180" end="00:19:41.260" style="s2">flow you&#39;re feeling within the in the</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.000" end="00:20:00.280" style="s2">friends silent 10-day a sitting day not</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.360" end="00:20:02.860" style="s2">my first deal recommendations but which</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.280" end="00:20:09.070" style="s2">practice is to use to alternate will</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.860" end="00:20:11.770" style="s2">there be tips in the guidebook so um</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.070" end="00:20:14.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s a good idea to</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.770" end="00:20:18.520" style="s2">have somebody who&#39;s leading a retreat</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.590" end="00:20:20.980" style="s2">who&#39;s had on some personal extensive</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.520" end="00:20:23.650" style="s2">practice with it and then it&#39;s good idea</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.980" end="00:20:26.440" style="s2">to have somebody there that has some</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.650" end="00:20:29.320" style="s2">psychotherapeutic training because</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.440" end="00:20:32.260" style="s2">sometimes in retreat things not for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.320" end="00:20:33.910" style="s2">people and stuff comes out so retreats</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.260" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">are very powerful that&#39;s why people do</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.910" end="00:20:38.620" style="s2">them but like anything powerful it could</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:41.320" style="s2">have unexpected consequences so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.620" end="00:20:48.360" style="s2">it&#39;s a good thing you know you can see</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.320" end="00:20:51.700" style="s2">some pretty dramatic behavior at times</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.360" end="00:20:53.110" style="s2">so it&#39;s good to have that there and also</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.700" end="00:20:55.300" style="s2">be able to answer people&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.110" end="00:21:00.370" style="s2">because they&#39;ll often confront some very</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.300" end="00:21:02.170" style="s2">challenging states I would recommend if</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.370" end="00:21:04.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do it if people are</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.170" end="00:21:06.850" style="s2">unfamiliar I would recommend just</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.060" end="00:21:07.809" style="s2">teaching them the the core four of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.850" end="00:21:13.239" style="s2">base and the base</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.809" end="00:21:16.119" style="s2">possibly know if they&#39;ve done other you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.239" end="00:21:19.269" style="s2">know they&#39;re quite advanced then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.119" end="00:21:21.580" style="s2">might try the alternation but pasta</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.269" end="00:21:23.619" style="s2">practice going into deeper pasta a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.580" end="00:21:25.570" style="s2">matter practice and then oppression of</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.619" end="00:21:27.099" style="s2">practice and then I would recommend if</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.570" end="00:21:29.649" style="s2">you can getting somebody who could lead</p>

<p begin="00:22:56.950" end="00:23:02.759" style="s2">why I said it&#39;s very very important to</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.659" end="00:23:14.830" style="s2">think that the effort there is probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.269" end="00:23:17.169" style="s2">because you&#39;re trying to get you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.830" end="00:23:18.549" style="s2">the deep Metta and the deeper person you</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.670" end="00:23:25.300" style="s2">and as for concept don&#39;t think of</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.559" end="00:23:26.679" style="s2">concepts things I think about movement</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.300" end="00:23:30.150" style="s2">of mind sir</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.679" end="00:23:33.100" style="s2">opening the mind out and then it right</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.150" end="00:23:37.720" style="s2">opening awareness out opening attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.100" end="00:23:39.820" style="s2">out opening your sense of what&#39;s present</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.720" end="00:23:43.260" style="s2">out not anything particular just that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.820" end="00:23:46.510" style="s2">opening and then melting to the core</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.260" end="00:23:49.450" style="s2">opening and then melting to the core so</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.510" end="00:23:53.800" style="s2">don&#39;t try and do concepts try to try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.450" end="00:23:55.990" style="s2">rye the motion of the mind that&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.990" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">try to accept that you&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.320" end="00:24:03.670" style="s2">get the deeper past not and a deep meta</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">until you&#39;ve been practicing this for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.670" end="00:24:07.320" style="s2">very long time hopefully that will help</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.530" end="00:24:12.970" style="s2">another question from strana the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.330" end="00:24:14.679" style="s2">person becomes really hard for me I lose</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.970" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">the breath in my Dottie and as an anchor</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.679" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">I feel like I become cut off from body</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">awareness sensation much of I like this</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:22.809" style="s2">is this normal</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:24.700" style="s2">yes it is normal it&#39;s normal for us when</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.809" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">we lose so you have the orientation</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.700" end="00:24:28.420" style="s2">association area in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:30.550" style="s2">according to Newberg and others this</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.420" end="00:24:32.470" style="s2">tells you where you are and very often</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.550" end="00:24:34.300" style="s2">when we get it to deeper person though</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.470" end="00:24:36.280" style="s2">we lose that now you don&#39;t lose the body</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.300" end="00:24:38.920" style="s2">because the body is actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.280" end="00:24:40.750" style="s2">it&#39;s energetically present I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.920" end="00:24:42.550" style="s2">using word energy I mean metabolic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.750" end="00:24:44.500" style="s2">cognitive information processing energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.550" end="00:24:46.330" style="s2">I don&#39;t mean anything strange or weird</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.500" end="00:24:48.250" style="s2">but it&#39;s so the body is present that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.330" end="00:24:54.010" style="s2">if you try to pick up on the energetic</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.250" end="00:24:55.720" style="s2">aspects so that can often help but it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.010" end="00:24:58.420" style="s2">very challenge for people with their</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.720" end="00:25:00.820" style="s2">sense of you know their body and who and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.420" end="00:25:03.670" style="s2">where they are and I mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.820" end="00:25:05.980" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of you know you&#39;re in your</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.670" end="00:25:08.380" style="s2">embodying your embody ego and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.980" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">nothing wrong with I&#39;m not criticizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.380" end="00:25:12.850" style="s2">insulting but your body evil can drop</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:14.800" style="s2">away mind and body drop away as doujin</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.850" end="00:25:17.530" style="s2">famously said and that it can be a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.800" end="00:25:19.480" style="s2">very disconcerting experience so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.530" end="00:25:21.400" style="s2">know maybe don&#39;t do deep the pasta too</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.480" end="00:25:25.630" style="s2">much maybe just a little bit as always</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.400" end="00:25:30.130" style="s2">you know very probative slowly trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.630" end="00:25:31.750" style="s2">shift slowly slowly slowly and right you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.130" end="00:25:32.710" style="s2">know that you&#39;re losing the sense of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.750" end="00:25:35.080" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.710" end="00:25:37.539" style="s2">more that scent like I said right</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.080" end="00:25:39.429" style="s2">there&#39;s still the the power of</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.539" end="00:25:45.309" style="s2">presencing itself sort of becomes your</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.429" end="00:25:46.990" style="s2">body Herren Agustin said I feel myself</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.309" end="00:25:51.220" style="s2">automatically meditating when falling</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.990" end="00:25:53.580" style="s2">asleep unis tips oh well that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.220" end="00:25:59.020" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.580" end="00:26:02.140" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s a really challenging</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.020" end="00:26:04.929" style="s2">one automatically and then the I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.140" end="00:26:06.610" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a very it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.929" end="00:26:08.049" style="s2">strongly recommended that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.610" end="00:26:10.450" style="s2">meditate before you fall asleep because</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.049" end="00:26:14.610" style="s2">as I said you&#39;ll associate meditation</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.450" end="00:26:18.850" style="s2">was falling asleep are you noticing</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.610" end="00:26:21.700" style="s2">their reverse at all that your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.850" end="00:26:23.289" style="s2">maybe moving towards sleepiness when</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.700" end="00:26:26.980" style="s2">you&#39;re meditating because that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.289" end="00:26:29.320" style="s2">a definite warning sign so I would</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.980" end="00:26:32.590" style="s2">suggest that you maybe prep you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.320" end="00:26:34.570" style="s2">give your your you mind another thing to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.590" end="00:26:36.190" style="s2">do rather than meditated so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.570" end="00:26:39.309" style="s2">that&#39;s very good because it gets you</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.190" end="00:26:41.470" style="s2">more into the frame for REM is to read</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.309" end="00:26:43.960" style="s2">some fiction read some narrative before</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.470" end="00:26:45.909" style="s2">going to sleep and we head to the point</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.960" end="00:26:47.409" style="s2">where you&#39;re really tired then see you</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.909" end="00:26:50.500" style="s2">can just drop away from the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.409" end="00:26:52.659" style="s2">into sleep rather than going into</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.500" end="00:26:56.880" style="s2">meditation hopefully that won&#39;t train</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.659" end="00:26:59.559" style="s2">you to associate sleepiness with reading</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.880" end="00:27:01.480" style="s2">Gabriel reasons done and prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.559" end="00:27:03.669" style="s2">it I find it feels like there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.480" end="00:27:05.799" style="s2">physical movement in my mind possibly my</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.799" end="00:27:09.730" style="s2">this okay I can avoid it but it seems to</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.270" end="00:27:16.750" style="s2">mentioned this when we have images that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.159" end="00:27:18.190" style="s2">are like lenses we&#39;re not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.750" end="00:27:20.260" style="s2">them but we&#39;re looking through it by</p>
