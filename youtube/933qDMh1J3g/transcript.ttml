<p begin="00:00:05.920" end="00:00:08.480" style="s2">at least from my point of view as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.440" end="00:00:11.679" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.480" end="00:00:14.799" style="s2">um i&#39;m thinking about this as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.679" end="00:00:16.640" style="s2">the unfolding meta crisis so the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.799" end="00:00:18.400" style="s2">rolling out of the virus and our</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.640" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">response to the virus is an aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.400" end="00:00:21.520" style="s2">the metacrisis</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:23.359" style="s2">but there&#39;s the second order and third</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.520" end="00:00:24.560" style="s2">order effects many of which are going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.359" end="00:00:26.960" style="s2">be as impactful</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.560" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">and so it&#39;s the whole thing so when i</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.960" end="00:00:30.160" style="s2">think about that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:32.239" style="s2">um and we spoke about this earlier in</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.160" end="00:00:33.680" style="s2">the context of new york city</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.239" end="00:00:35.840" style="s2">that there is effectively at the very</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.680" end="00:00:38.800" style="s2">top is choice between</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.840" end="00:00:39.360" style="s2">do we respond to this by breaking uh</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.800" end="00:00:44.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.360" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">to by balkanizing into us versus them or</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.000" end="00:00:49.360" style="s2">do we respond to this by coming together</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">into we right and in many ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.360" end="00:00:53.680" style="s2">the most important piece um</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:56.800" style="s2">and you talked about the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.680" end="00:00:59.840" style="s2">have a sense that the uk has a</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.800" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">both an instinct and a capability of</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.840" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">of coming back together into a we</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:06.080" style="s2">under times of crisis well and you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:08.000" style="s2">they will yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">i think i&#39;d like to recap that because</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.000" end="00:01:11.920" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about stuff we</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">we discussed we started recording but</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.920" end="00:01:15.600" style="s2">yeah my sense and i&#39;ve always had this</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.439" style="s2">sense is that the uk</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.600" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">there is such a thing as a coherence of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.439" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">the national conversation in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:24.000" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of held it&#39;s held in various</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">places held in the centrality of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.000" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">of the the fact that the media and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.200" style="s2">politicians all went to the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">universities it&#39;s held in the centrality</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.200" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">of london</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">it&#39;s held in the bbc it&#39;s held there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:36.159" style="s2">there&#39;s just a kind of coherence to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:38.320" style="s2">national conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.159" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">um and it&#39;s obviously on a deeper level</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.320" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">held within sort of very british values</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">um which have been sort of tested</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">recently but sort of fair play</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:47.360" style="s2">and all of those kind of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:49.280" style="s2">british values</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">and i do get a sense of coherence that i</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.280" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">don&#39;t get from the american conversation</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">which is really</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:55.920" style="s2">the american talent is like dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.920" end="00:01:59.840" style="s2">and that&#39;s what drives america forward</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s also it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.840" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">centripetal is that central centrifugal</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">one of the two</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">people centripetal force that pulls</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:13.200" style="s2">um so that&#39;s my sense of what a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">america or no i think it&#39;s centrifugal i</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.200" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">think i think you&#39;re right the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">centrifuge pulls things apart yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:19.760" style="s2">centrifuge</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">um so yes and i think we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.760" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">even a starker relief so in the past 48</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">hours</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:30.879" style="s2">serbia kind of the archetype of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">balkanization</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.879" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">the president said europe it turns out</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">europe was just talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">like we cannot get any help from europe</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not sending us support they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">not sending us mass nothing as</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:43.280" style="s2">ventilators</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">europe everybody in europe is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.280" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">pulling back and taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">themselves and letting everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:50.879" style="s2">ride</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:53.519" style="s2">we must rely on our brothers in china</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.879" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">okay so the european experiment so if</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.519" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">you look at like</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">uh the us is a highly heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">country particularly in comparison to</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:02.319" style="s2">any other nation it&#39;s by far the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:04.319" style="s2">heterogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.319" end="00:03:06.159" style="s2">but europe is as itself is also</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.319" end="00:03:09.040" style="s2">heterogeneous as a unit</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.159" end="00:03:10.480" style="s2">and doesn&#39;t really have any tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.040" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">being able to come together into a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.480" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">so one it&#39;s a very reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">expectation that the european experiment</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:20.560" style="s2">is now deeply deeply in trouble because</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:21.599" style="s2">the people are beginning to realize the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.560" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">only way for them to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.599" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">themselves is to take care of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">um with the possible exception that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:28.319" style="s2">might see germany do something extremely</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.319" end="00:03:33.280" style="s2">and ramp up something that can actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">support europe as a whole um</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.280" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">that would be by the way a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">interesting turnabout like the the final</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">like okay it turns out in when</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.760" style="s2">the chips that we go with the hits</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">the fan it&#39;s not world war one it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.760" end="00:03:44.400" style="s2">world war ii</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">the germans are also able to be the guys</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.400" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">who pull things together that&#39;d be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">good a good result</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">um and then okay so that&#39;s europe and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:53.680" style="s2">and this notion of like okay wow serbia</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">really showing us what balkanization</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">really means like what&#39;s the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">a collective conversation and then we</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">have the the american side</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">and the american side we have this uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">frankly it&#39;s very fractal</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">right so i mentioned that new york is</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">just going super critical right the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.599" style="s2">number of cases are</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">are steeply accelerating probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.599" end="00:04:16.160" style="s2">because of detection not because of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">spread but the felt sense of that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.160" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">hitting</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:21.280" style="s2">but my my intuition actually feels</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">confident</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.280" end="00:04:24.400" style="s2">my intuition feels confident because</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s those characteristics of new</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.400" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">york city in particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got a bunch of people who at</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">the end of the day are very practical</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:33.520" style="s2">and very hard-edged i think they like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">get done like the formality of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.520" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">conversation new york is funny</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:38.800" style="s2">you like within 30 seconds if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">talking about something that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.800" end="00:04:42.639" style="s2">worth my time get the out of here</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.639" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">but two they actually have a sense of we</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">right to be a new yorker is a thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">and you can look across the line and see</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:52.240" style="s2">a guy who&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">two generations ago his his his</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.240" end="00:04:54.639" style="s2">ethnicity was</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t speak the language was somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.639" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">completely out and you two generations</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:58.479" style="s2">ago we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:00.479" style="s2">but you&#39;re both new yorkers and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.479" end="00:05:01.440" style="s2">you can help each other and then third</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.479" end="00:05:02.320" style="s2">they have the cultural memory of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.440" end="00:05:04.560" style="s2">september 11th</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.320" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">so they actually have a live sense of oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.560" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">okay we remember what crisis feels like</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:09.759" style="s2">can we remember what it feels like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.919" style="s2">come together as a as a people</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.759" end="00:05:13.680" style="s2">so the ability of new york city to</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.919" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">respond is at least in potential very</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.680" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">high</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">but in many ways for america this is how</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">it goes as you say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">question of do we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">the capacity the willingness and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">capacity to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.520" style="s2">all of the gradient all the difference</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.600" style="s2">that&#39;s embedded in who we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.520" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">and bring that back together into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.600" end="00:05:34.639" style="s2">higher synthesis right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.440" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">this is the state and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.639" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">cycles like this it is a spiral</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:40.000" style="s2">right if you kind of look at our case</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:46.800" style="s2">in 1776 yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">80 years later in 1860 no</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.800" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">80 years later in 1940 yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">80 years later in 2020 question mark</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">right so we&#39;re going to find out and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:01.600" style="s2">i mean we were saying just before as</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.120" style="s2">well that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.600" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">i certainly my sense i think you agree</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.120" end="00:06:05.680" style="s2">is that this is going to play out very</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">differently in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.680" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">because it&#39;s going to test</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">it&#39;s going to basically stress test the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:12.800" style="s2">society it&#39;s going to stress test the</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">culture it&#39;s going to stress test</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">the um the memetic complex that we call</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:19.680" style="s2">national identity it&#39;s like this set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.680" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s going to play out very</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.120" end="00:06:23.520" style="s2">differently in different countries</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">depending on that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.520" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny like you can even say</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s a bit of a uh how would you</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">how would you name it it&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.000" style="s2">i guess the best metaphor i can use is</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">that notion of like a sonar ping</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.000" end="00:06:41.520" style="s2">um because you get this this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">the shape of almost like the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.520" end="00:06:44.960" style="s2">interior of a culture</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">so compare like like we have to be very</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.960" end="00:06:49.759" style="s2">very precise let&#39;s compare</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.880" style="s2">singapore to china so if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.759" end="00:06:52.720" style="s2">china&#39;s response</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.880" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">and by the way i&#39;m not going to run the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.720" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">model of the chinese are actually acting</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">strategic machiavellian man i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">going to run in the model that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.240" style="s2">like they&#39;re acting as they</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">they themselves would like to be best</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.240" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">perceived so in the chinese response you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">have something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:12.639" style="s2">corruption bureaucracy</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:14.720" style="s2">political maneuvering leading to a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.639" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">bungled response where whistleblowers</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.720" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">were shut down</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:20.560" style="s2">and and city leaders who knew stuff were</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">directed not to share things</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:24.240" style="s2">for too long and by the way let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">very careful</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:29.120" style="s2">uh under that model</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.639" style="s2">the world has this because of that right</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.120" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">it got big enough in china that it did</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.639" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">spread globally</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.960" style="s2">but then right once once a pivot point</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">happened the chinese response kicked</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.960" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">the other side which showed up as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:44.160" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">amazingly remarkably harsh level</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">of shutdown like people being like</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:50.479" style="s2">police just going door to door to giant</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">apartment buildings and literally just</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.479" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">welding them shut right no voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">no that in china they just lock</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">your ass into the apartment building and</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">good luck to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:02.080" style="s2">and people on the streets just being</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">grabbed and thrown into cars</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.080" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">like the level of capacity there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">high now</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:09.280" style="s2">net net it seems like it worked right so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:10.000" style="s2">that we can look at the chinese model</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.280" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">and say huh</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.000" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">on the one hand we get a sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:16.560" style="s2">that approach looks like you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">a very uh you know high corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.560" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">high bureaucratic and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">and cover your ass and difference</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">followed by super</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:24.400" style="s2">harsh top down almost ruthless levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.400" end="00:08:27.919" style="s2">of protection from the top and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">results in</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.919" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">um x level of impact</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">look at singapore by contrast</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">you know the singapore right now is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">still the probably the most well-oiled</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">machine on the planet and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:44.320" style="s2">simultaneously reacted almost instantly</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">as soon as there was a real threat</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.320" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">everything shut down it did not shut</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.240" style="s2">down with significant ruthlessness</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">but it did shut down with enormous</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.240" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">completeness</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">and kind of still is like they&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:56.320" style="s2">it they&#39;re probably the best job on the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">planet</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.320" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">uh and there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.240" style="s2">nature of singapore that has that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">they&#39;re still a very hardwired but</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.240" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">somewhat smooth</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">kind of well integrated command and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">control infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:09.120" style="s2">look at korea you look at japan i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">we&#39;re going to go globally so you get</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.120" end="00:09:13.519" style="s2">this very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:15.200" style="s2">perspective on the one hand of getting</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.519" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">like a how is it how did i say this like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.200" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">open kimono insight into the true nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">of how a culture really operates in</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.519" style="s2">response to crisis</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">um and a you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.519" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">for whether we like it or not a uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:32.090" style="s2">a revelation of the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">culture&#39;s current capacity</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.090" end="00:09:37.440" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">and let&#39;s let&#39;s sort of recap the</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.440" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">we you mentioned the meta crisis so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">maybe let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">and we&#39;ve featured you talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">on the channel before but</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">obviously now it just just has a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">ramped up relevance and i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">more people are starting to realize</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">exactly what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">uh was trying to be talked about do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">want to kind of outline where you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">we are in the meta crisis and what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:59.600" style="s2">even mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">in this context of just the people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.600" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">most people are focused on right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">sure um so the the concept is is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.360" style="s2">point out</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:12.240" style="s2">i guess a couple of things i&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.360" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">at the top and work down so at the top</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.240" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">is the recognition that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">we live in a nested set of many</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">different systems that are all part of a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">larger system and are connected in very</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:26.880" style="s2">complex ways</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">and this sort of has always been the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.880" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">case but quite often</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to pay that much attention</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">the um kind of the classic case in point</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">is that we don&#39;t usually think about a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">a viral crisis like a truly health</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">as also being an economic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:51.440" style="s2">a bunch of people getting sick is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">thing that the doctors and the cdc are</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.440" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">supposed to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re kind of worried about whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:56.959" style="s2">or not and how many people get sick and</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:58.399" style="s2">how bad that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.959" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">we think about our own personal health</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.399" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">and the people think we love</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">we don&#39;t imagine that the people at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">federal reserve board should be watching</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:09.600" style="s2">that crisis very closely because those</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t the kind of same kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.600" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">they should be watching interest rates</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:13.040" style="s2">and real estate prices and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.040" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">and yet of course they&#39;re connected and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a transition</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:20.640" style="s2">where the called the subsystem the part</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.000" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.640" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">larger system that kind of takes health</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:26.959" style="s2">very seriously and looks at it very</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:29.680" style="s2">closely</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">it gets overwhelmed and the consequences</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.680" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">the impacts</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:34.720" style="s2">cause just from an economic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.959" style="s2">the externalities of that subsystem</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.720" end="00:11:38.560" style="s2">start throwing externalities out into</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.959" end="00:11:40.640" style="s2">other subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.560" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">which now need to be paid attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.640" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">and if you&#39;re not paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">them you get blindsided</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:46.079" style="s2">you just get whacked in the back of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">head because you weren&#39;t looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.079" end="00:11:50.720" style="s2">you were looking here</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:53.920" style="s2">and that just slammed you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.720" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">so at the meta level the point</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.920" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">is that and this is the the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">hypothesis that about operating under</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">for now for about 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">is that this has been going on for a</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">long time in fact</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">it just hasn&#39;t been acute it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">chronic so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">the 2008 financial crisis in america as</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">financial crisis um</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">had the systemic infection where it</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">spread from the united states to europe</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">and then spread from europe to china and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:22.639" style="s2">then kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:24.320" style="s2">cascaded around we&#39;re like oh all right</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.639" end="00:12:25.920" style="s2">we forgot each</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">country&#39;s economy and each country&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:29.680" style="s2">financial system is connected to all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">rest through a global financial system</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.680" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">we have to be able to think about that</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">as a whole system</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.800" style="s2">which as far as i can tell we very</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.320" style="s2">distinctly fail that and we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.800" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">worse at managing it as a whole system</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.320" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">now than we were in 2008.</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:45.680" style="s2">um but equally</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">uh we see that there&#39;s there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.680" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">spillover effect that the way that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.600" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">responded to</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">in in the states to the 2008 to 2010</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:55.279" style="s2">crisis and the way that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">you in europe they responded to the 2010</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.279" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">to 2015 crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.839" end="00:13:01.519" style="s2">spilled over into the social and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.360" style="s2">political day we got we got the tea</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.519" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">party and eventually we got trump</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.360" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">from that i think it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.200" style="s2">for people to recognize that the causal</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.519" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.200" end="00:13:11.440" style="s2">that leads to trump begins well it</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.519" end="00:13:14.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t begin to has a big push</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.440" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">in the financial system in 2008 and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.320" end="00:13:16.880" style="s2">causal structure that leads to brexit</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">begins</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.880" end="00:13:20.160" style="s2">or at least has a very strong causal</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.160" end="00:13:23.279" style="s2">to the european debt crisis and how that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">was responded to</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.279" end="00:13:27.120" style="s2">the way the banks were bailed out and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">the technocrats</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.120" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">really did push</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">harm to people and protect uh proximal</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">institutions created a big deep sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:40.399" style="s2">don&#39;t trust those guys</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">and that cascaded out so that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.399" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">and um kind of to put a line in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">middle</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:51.360" style="s2">the the theory is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a uh a driver in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">culture a global culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.040" style="s2">at least in the dominant sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:02.240" style="s2">neoliberal globalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.040" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">that has a strong bias in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.240" end="00:14:10.000" style="s2">of optimization for</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">efficiency of a specific set of metrics</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.000" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">so what that does is that that basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">sort of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">deep driver gives you that metric</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">at a high level right so you can get gdp</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">but at the cost of fragility it pulls</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">you you get one metric optimized at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">cost of other metrics</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">other things that matter being down</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">regulated or at least made</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">vulnerable and so you become fragile</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">and you don&#39;t necessarily notice</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">fragility until something</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:46.240" style="s2">heavy or hard or fast hits the system</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">okay so you have to combine these two</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.240" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">one is that we actually have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:50.320" style="s2">bunch of different systems that are</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">actually deeply interconnected but in</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.320" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">ways that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.440" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">oftentimes don&#39;t watch and in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:57.279" style="s2">aren&#39;t even aware of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:58.880" style="s2">and then two we&#39;ve been going through</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.279" end="00:15:02.160" style="s2">the process for seven</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.880" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">decades of trying to optimize these</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.160" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:06.160" style="s2">which makes the systems and the meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.160" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">increasingly fragile okay so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">what i would say is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:16.079" style="s2">experiencing right now was baked in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">was going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.079" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">it was just waiting for the right</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.199" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">event right the right perturbation the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">right magnitude of effect to hit</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:29.600" style="s2">a subsystem with enough speed and</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">or impact that it began the process of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.600" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">creating cascade effects to hit other</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">subsystems and pushing beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.880" end="00:15:39.040" style="s2">fragility levels so that they began to</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.480" style="s2">break and throw externalities into</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.040" end="00:15:42.480" style="s2">still more subsystems right so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.480" end="00:15:44.160" style="s2">cascade failure across</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.480" end="00:15:45.519" style="s2">different literally different modal</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.160" end="00:15:46.880" style="s2">systems so it&#39;s one thing for like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.519" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">finance system the u.s to hit the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.880" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">finance system in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:51.120" style="s2">because at least they&#39;re both financed</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">and we can kind of like think about them</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.120" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit harder when the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:56.240" style="s2">finance system hits the economic system</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:57.519" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.240" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">sometimes we can&#39;t even distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.519" end="00:15:59.759" style="s2">between the two and recognize they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.759" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">but it&#39;s a real deal when the finance</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">system say hits the health system</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.519" end="00:16:07.279" style="s2">and we really have a hard time even</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:09.759" style="s2">thinking about how they relate</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.279" end="00:16:11.440" style="s2">so so all of that is precursors and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.759" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">saying okay right now where we are is we</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.440" end="00:16:15.440" style="s2">are witnessing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">in real time that happening that that</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.440" end="00:16:20.240" style="s2">fragility</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">being revealed in uh very complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.240" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:28.079" style="s2">in sub-systems so let&#39;s be very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:31.199" style="s2">um the number of beds</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.079" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">per capita makes a big difference to how</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.199" end="00:16:35.120" style="s2">your country</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.399" end="00:16:35.440" style="s2">will weather the viral storm one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.120" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">weak</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.440" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">points is what&#39;s called medical system</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">overwhelm and it&#39;s funny how like we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:43.600" style="s2">watch the culture evolve</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.839" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">a month ago that phrase medical system</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.600" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">didn&#39;t really exist more and more people</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:49.759" style="s2">began to look around and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that matters</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.759" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">and then the name spreads we now have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">concept medical sister overwhelmed which</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">is to say</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">the uk just recently sort of published a</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">big paper that talks about this in a big</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">if i&#39;ve got a medical system that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">designed to be able to handle</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">you know 10 icu cases</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">per thousand people per month</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:12.880" style="s2">and i suddenly jumped to 11.</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of like this phase</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.880" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">transition where i&#39;ve got a a pint glass</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">that&#39;s what you guys drink right pints</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:20.799" style="s2">yeah and um you know filling it up with</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">beer</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.799" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a period of time where it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:25.520" style="s2">sort of more and more full</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:27.439" style="s2">no real like whatever it&#39;s all it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.520" end="00:17:29.039" style="s2">kind of the same dynamic it&#39;s half full</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.439" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">it&#39;s three quarters full there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.039" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">variations of full once it actually hits</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:34.240" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">full i go through a phase transition</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.240" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">where it&#39;s spilling beer all over the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">floor</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.160" end="00:17:39.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s a different kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:40.480" style="s2">right now instead of just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.200" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">closing the tap and handing it to</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.480" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">somebody i have to think about oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">how do i scramble do i clean it up</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">you know externalities are spilled into</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.840" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">the into the pub</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">so if i&#39;ve got a medical system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">designed to handle 10 icu beds</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:58.480" style="s2">per thousand people but then i have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">an epidemic that suddenly moves me to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.480" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">11.</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:04.559" style="s2">that eleventh bed isn&#39;t just plus one</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">now i actually have a completely</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.559" end="00:18:07.520" style="s2">different dynamic because i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:08.799" style="s2">the capacity to give them the medical</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.520" end="00:18:10.799" style="s2">care that they need like where are they</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.799" end="00:18:13.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not in an icu bed where are they</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.799" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">are they like thrown into a tent outside</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.280" end="00:18:15.520" style="s2">or they just left</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.039" style="s2">dying on the floor like what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.520" end="00:18:19.280" style="s2">happening there they get to the 12th</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.039" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">the 13th the 14th to 15th and we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.280" end="00:18:22.960" style="s2">this very practically in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:24.240" style="s2">mortality statistics you know in places</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">where the medical system is not</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.240" end="00:18:27.520" style="s2">overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:28.799" style="s2">the mortality statistics tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.520" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">vectoring into</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.799" end="00:18:32.080" style="s2">less than one percent in places where</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">the medical system</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.080" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">is overwhelmed they tend to be vectoring</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:36.480" style="s2">towards greater than five percent that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">a big switch</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.480" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s just a very and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:40.559" style="s2">not necessarily even the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:44.720" style="s2">matters it&#39;s a nice</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.559" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">sort of visceral hard point you see that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.720" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">okay so the the number of beds per</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:52.640" style="s2">thousand people around the world varies</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:55.120" style="s2">quite widely</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.640" end="00:18:56.640" style="s2">i believe korea was somewhere around 10</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.120" end="00:18:59.760" style="s2">or higher</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.640" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">whereas the u.s is is around two well</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.760" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">why is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:03.760" style="s2">well the reason for that is because the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">american medical system has been</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.760" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">optimizing for efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">for a long time and so up until now two</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">has been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">good enough we&#39;ve never run into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">situation where we needed more than two</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">and then holding an extra icu bed when</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t need it</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">has an extra cost basis which decreases</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.600" style="s2">the bottom line so this is like</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">a long-term impact of the financial</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.600" end="00:19:25.520" style="s2">system and by the way also the</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:28.640" style="s2">governance</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.520" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">system conspiring to lead to fragility</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.640" end="00:19:31.919" style="s2">at the level of the medical system</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:33.280" style="s2">which we didn&#39;t really have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.919" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">until we had to deal with it which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.280" end="00:19:36.559" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">so that&#39;s a one piece it&#39;s very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.559" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">in which we&#39;re running into</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.160" end="00:19:42.720" style="s2">well that&#39;s a lot i just said a whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:43.840" style="s2">bunch of words i don&#39;t know how much of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.720" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">it is uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.840" end="00:19:47.039" style="s2">coherent or how much of it lands but</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">maybe uh what&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.039" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">yeah i mean we could use that point to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">expand from there really because</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">i mean that that seems to me to be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:19:59.840" style="s2">most constructive</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">large frame to use which is that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.840" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">got a system that optimizes for</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:07.039" style="s2">for efficiency therefore takes all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">the slack out of the system</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.039" end="00:20:11.520" style="s2">by definition you then don&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">resilience in any of the systems because</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.520" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">any extra capacity would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">would be surplus to requirements</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:20.720" style="s2">therefore inefficient so you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.400" style="s2">you create by definition like fragile</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.720" end="00:20:24.240" style="s2">systems all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.400" end="00:20:25.679" style="s2">yeah and by the way so we&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.240" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">deep do you mind going deep here let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.679" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">go deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:30.960" style="s2">um these are super fundamental concepts</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:32.240" style="s2">this is the kind of stuff that i should</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.960" end="00:20:35.679" style="s2">have been putting in my own channel</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">all right evolution you know we i use</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">evolution like brett often to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:39.679" style="s2">of things in this case it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:44.320" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.679" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">so the sabertooth tiger</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.320" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">is optimized for efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very fragile to changes in its</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:55.039" style="s2">niche</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">it goes extinct so what happens is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">if i have a niche if i have a uh an</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">that stays relatively static</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">for a long enough period of time what</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">ends up happening is that the way to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:11.360" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">is to find a niche and then to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.360" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">for efficiency in that niche right</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">there&#39;s no point in holding things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.280" end="00:21:20.000" style="s2">don&#39;t aren&#39;t valuable because it&#39;s been</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.000" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">that change ain&#39;t going to come and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.440" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">the saber-toothed tiger that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the long teeth and has the</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:31.039" style="s2">shorter teeth is less effective in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.120" end="00:21:32.320" style="s2">context of a particular environment than</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.039" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">the one that has the long teeth</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.320" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">so it keeps selecting for longer and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">longer teeth bigger body mass whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">the characteristics are that make it</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:43.200" style="s2">the peak predator now okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">and so niches that say static for a long</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.200" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">enough period of time and by long enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">what i mean is literally in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">to the evolutionary cycle of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.320" style="s2">so for safer tooth tigers they have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">reproductive rate and a mutation rate so</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">if you have like</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">a million years of the same environment</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">very optimized organisms</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:06.240" style="s2">and in evolutionary theory it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">clear we know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.240" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">very optimized organisms are also very</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">fragile organisms which means that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">a relatively small change in the</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:20.320" style="s2">leads to a catastrophic effect on their</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:21.760" style="s2">genome which is to say extinction and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.320" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">if you&#39;d say like</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.760" end="00:22:26.000" style="s2">for the for the for the hedgehog when</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:28.320" style="s2">the environment changes by</p>

<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:35.280" style="s2">effectiveness because it&#39;s actually a</p>

<p begin="00:22:35.280" end="00:22:38.320" style="s2">whereas the saber-toothed tiger with a</p>

<p begin="00:22:38.320" end="00:22:41.520" style="s2">change in the niche it goes to zero it</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">just completely goes away because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.520" end="00:22:46.159" style="s2">kind of sitting on top this extremely</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">rarefied very particular thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:49.679" style="s2">and of course the actual inverse is true</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:50.400" style="s2">where the environment is changing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.679" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">relatively</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.400" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">commonly you get these creatures that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:55.520" style="s2">are super generalized</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">which is more that&#39;s how humans resulted</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.520" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">right we happened to emerge in an</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:22:59.520" style="s2">environment where</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">we kept going through situations where</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.520" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">the polar the ice ages kept coming and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.039" style="s2">going and coming and going and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:07.760" style="s2">kind of going from a place where we had</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.039" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">lush forests and then suddenly like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.760" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">grasslands with</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">trees in between and then deserts and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">then back in and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.440" style="s2">only those tool kits that were able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">maintain the sort of efficiency of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.440" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">generality were able to survive at all</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">and then each bottleneck kicked that off</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">to the next stage</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">okay and remind my by the way i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:30.720" style="s2">one more major conceptual toolkit that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">needs to be dropped in but i&#39;ll finish</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.720" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">so one of the things that happened in in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:42.000" style="s2">is more or less after world war ii and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:45.760" style="s2">particularly after the fall of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.000" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">of communism we had two dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.760" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">hooked together uh one was an</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.880" end="00:23:53.200" style="s2">entrainment meaning that that what would</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:54.559" style="s2">had otherwise been a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.200" end="00:23:55.279" style="s2">different niches that were behaving</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.559" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">differently</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.279" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">like we talked about earlier france</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.159" style="s2">being france and germany being germany</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:02.000" style="s2">in the uk in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.159" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">suddenly started gluing together into</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.000" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">one meta niche so a company that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">peugeot which perhaps was effective as</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">an organism inside france</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">suddenly was not as effective in an</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">organism called global trade</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:16.480" style="s2">you know daimler benz and toyota were</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.480" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">more competitive and so in the context</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">of the global this new sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">global niche local</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:25.840" style="s2">organisms suddenly started evaporating</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">they just couldn&#39;t compete we started</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.840" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">getting this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">entrainment of one giant beach</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.919" style="s2">and the second thing we had was this</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.960" style="s2">thing called the great moderation</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.919" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">where the intentional</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.960" end="00:24:42.080" style="s2">deliberate and effective use of</p>

<p begin="00:24:42.080" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">was able to maintain a stasis of niche</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:51.200" style="s2">for a long enough time relative to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">reproductive mutations</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:58.640" style="s2">and social organisms that we became</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">fragile</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.640" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">and i mean that not only at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:02.320" style="s2">systems they also mean that at the level</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:11.120" style="s2">for example somewhere in the late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.200" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">we should have actually had a big</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">of socio-technical responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.480" end="00:25:22.400" style="s2">from the 50s era</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">mentality and organizational structure</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.400" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">individuals to a rising wave</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">literally in a different biological</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">and the the wave of digital capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.840" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">and peer-to-peer communication that</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out now</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">should actually have gone through a</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:47.919" style="s2">normal childhood in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">and by the 90s should have that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.919" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">have been handed off</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:53.120" style="s2">in a what&#39;s that called a peaceful</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">alpha and beta as the guy next to you</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.480" end="00:27:00.240" style="s2">and so you got it selected against</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">and everybody became safer chief tigers</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.240" end="00:27:03.279" style="s2">and so that&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">um and let me</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">re say that again to make sure it really</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">lands um</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">that that i actually described two</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:19.200" style="s2">different dynamics that happened</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">one was an artificially constrained</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.200" end="00:27:22.960" style="s2">longer than it could and should have</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:25.360" style="s2">been duration of a niche</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.960" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">like the sabretooth tiger&#39;s niche which</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:29.279" style="s2">generated an</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">enormous amount of selective</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.279" end="00:27:32.320" style="s2">evolution into highly optimized</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.320" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">and by the way optimized for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">artificially constrained niche and</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">it&#39;s very important to say artificially</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">constrained because the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">the forces of change were building up</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">france</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">right france the french language like</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.399" style="s2">this notion of we&#39;re going to use a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">human institution the academy to hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.399" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">the language from evolving</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.240" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">and hold it and hold it and hold it but</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:57.919" style="s2">the forces of change are building up</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">technology is changing culture is</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.919" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">changing the times are changing and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">it ends up happening that environment is</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t elegantly move it actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">just has to shatter</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:07.520" style="s2">and you have kind of a breaking event</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:08.320" style="s2">and then change happens all like</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.520" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">willy-nilly</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.320" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">and then some new state hits and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">kind of what happened right we had a</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">whole bunch of governance institutions</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:18.880" style="s2">that had the capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">the intent to manage the globe hey we</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.880" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">bad things to ever happen again to</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">and they were effectively able to kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.399" style="s2">of hold change from happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.240" style="s2">and they held it and held it and held it</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.399" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">what they did is they pushed change out</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.240" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">from a from a sort of an elegant smooth</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">movement to this</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">building up on the outside of the dam</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:40.159" style="s2">inside the dam</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">we had artificial sameness which caused</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.159" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">saber-toothed tigers to evolve in all of</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:45.440" style="s2">our niches our academic system</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">our medical system our governance system</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.440" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">our scientific academies you know eric</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">weinstein&#39;s been hammering</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">the same why in the world have our</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">journalistic and our academic</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">institutions</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">been increasingly steered by guys who</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">were born in the 1940s and 50s what why</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:02.640" style="s2">isn&#39;t there any fresh blood coming in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.640" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">literally just a human level and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.640" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">why this is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:08.399" style="s2">so what happens is we put ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">situation where when change</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.399" end="00:29:12.000" style="s2">comes it&#39;s going to come hard suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">the damn</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.000" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">bursts like the levees bursting in</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">katrina in new orleans</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">and it bursts into an environment where</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">all the resilience has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:21.360" style="s2">sucked out of the system so it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.480" end="00:29:23.360" style="s2">and breaks and breaks and breaks and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.360" end="00:29:26.320" style="s2">breaks and breaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.360" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">um okay so that was a big conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.320" end="00:29:28.559" style="s2">payload</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:29.919" style="s2">and if anybody landed it i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.559" end="00:29:31.679" style="s2">gonna get a whole lot of orientation</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.919" end="00:29:33.440" style="s2">about why we&#39;re where we are</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.679" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">where we are and what&#39;s likely to</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.440" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">continue to happen and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.720" end="00:29:37.919" style="s2">if this particular event doesn&#39;t break</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.919" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">all the rip stops and tear things apart</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">unless we figure out how to reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">polarity and begin to actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">evolve again and rebuild resilient</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:54.159" style="s2">anti-fragile capacities</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:56.880" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d like to in a moment talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.159" end="00:29:58.240" style="s2">the the stress and the crisis of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.880" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">making sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.240" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">uh and how how kind of the media and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">collective intelligence have shown up</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:06.000" style="s2">but just before we do that i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">recap you said something</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.000" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">i saw a talk you gave a couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">ago where you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">addiction and the similarities between</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">denial that have been showing up i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.960" style="s2">love i&#39;d love to hear that piece for</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:19.440" style="s2">for our audience oh yeah okay well</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.440" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s another conceptual model</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:23.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s important and it&#39;s a big one</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">that fits in here as well</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.360" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">and it really resonated with me because</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.559" style="s2">i&#39;ve been dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:29.919" style="s2">like having a close personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.559" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">of that dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.919" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">of denial of denial of reality and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.960" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">that moment of kind of realization so</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">yeah i&#39;d love to hear it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">all right so so we have like let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:42.640" style="s2">it a baseline cycle and unfortunately i</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t know the name so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.640" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">can find it and put it in a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">subtext i&#39;ve forgotten the name but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:49.279" style="s2">the basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">cycle of you know denial and acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.279" end="00:30:52.799" style="s2">and bargaining and all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:55.440" style="s2">um and this seems to be just a natural</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.799" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a kubler-ross uh stages of grief</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.440" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.640" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">right so there we go uh so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:00.640" style="s2">cooperative stages of grief seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">a part of just</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.640" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">psychology and frankly there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:04.640" style="s2">really good reasons for it it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.279" style="s2">selected for over long periods of time</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.640" end="00:31:08.640" style="s2">and lots of different content</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.279" end="00:31:10.799" style="s2">and think of that as like the natural</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.640" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">thing so no matter what when you run</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.799" end="00:31:12.720" style="s2">into something that&#39;s going to hit you</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.720" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">big shift in change you will go through</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:22.559" style="s2">so don&#39;t fight it swim swim with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">so when you&#39;re feeling um uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.559" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">really depressed by the realization that</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:28.880" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.399" style="s2">are much worse than you thought in some</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.880" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">sense if you can be metacognitively</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.399" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">aware of the fact that you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">right place</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">and just kind of allow yourself to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:36.880" style="s2">process that in the way it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">processed so you can get into the other</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.880" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">side of acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:41.919" style="s2">as smoothly as possible not as quick you</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">can&#39;t make it go faster than you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.919" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">then you&#39;re then you&#39;re doing as well as</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">and i want to put a particular note i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:50.960" style="s2">noticed in myself at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">four of these cycles the last one was</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.960" end="00:31:54.480" style="s2">two days ago at three a.m</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:56.080" style="s2">um so something&#39;s going on right now</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.480" end="00:31:57.600" style="s2">with this the rate of change and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.080" end="00:31:59.519" style="s2">magnitude of change and the quality of</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.600" end="00:32:01.440" style="s2">changes such that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.519" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">acceptance which is to say to begin to</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.440" end="00:32:03.919" style="s2">step into building an adaptive response</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">to what</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.919" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">is actually finds itself yet again</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">overwhelmed by a change of what is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">is big enough in magnitude to require</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:11.360" style="s2">that you actually go through a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:14.159" style="s2">cycle</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.360" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of like an unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.159" end="00:32:17.360" style="s2">powerful part of what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:18.799" style="s2">but then we actually have a different</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.360" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">dynamic and this is the dynamic of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.799" end="00:32:23.600" style="s2">addiction</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:25.519" style="s2">which has to do mostly with denial</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.600" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">so this is a breakdown of our sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.519" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">making and choice making system</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">where reality hits us</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s actually not it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">this is koopa ross system but a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">particular subset of what happens it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.399" style="s2">a reciprocal closing of their reiki as</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:43.519" style="s2">rebecca describes it</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.399" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">so reality hits us um</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.519" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">and we kind of have a choice we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.919" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:52.240" style="s2">deal with the this cycle deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:53.679" style="s2">unpleasantness of this cycle and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.240" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">necessity of actually changing our</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.679" end="00:32:58.559" style="s2">behavior</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:02.240" style="s2">or we can ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.559" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">right and we have that choice and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.240" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">if we happen to have in some sense the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">privilege the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">of being able to ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:11.120" style="s2">not have reality really kick us in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:14.000" style="s2">teeth</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.120" end="00:33:15.840" style="s2">it&#39;s all too easy to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.000" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">and if the magnitude of change</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:19.360" style="s2">that we have to go through in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">context of reality feels</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.360" end="00:33:22.799" style="s2">uncomfortable enough right so we get</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.440" end="00:33:23.519" style="s2">this kind of separation this is why by</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.799" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.519" end="00:33:28.000" style="s2">uh addiction can really really hammer</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.399" style="s2">the wealthy</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.000" end="00:33:31.840" style="s2">because money allows you to buy not</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.399" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">changing</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.840" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">a lot easier you don&#39;t hit rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">as painfully</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.279" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">which is kind of an odd thing like</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">oftentimes people who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">resources</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">get you know it gets really bad because</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">they do hit rock bottom</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">but the amount of sort of what gets</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:51.120" style="s2">pulled with them in duration in life</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:54.159" style="s2">may in fact be shorter cycle we hit rock</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.120" end="00:33:55.760" style="s2">bottom in years as opposed to in decades</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.159" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">but in any event as a culture this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.760" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">particularly the case so in the west</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">the max the massive plenitude we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:03.519" style="s2">able to produce over the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">70 years</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.519" end="00:34:06.880" style="s2">has given us the ability to sort of kick</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">the can down the road</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.880" end="00:34:11.599" style="s2">to go into bullshitting ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.040" style="s2">and avoiding the uncomfortable reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.599" end="00:34:14.720" style="s2">of the necessity of changing</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.040" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">what are in fact rather significant</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.720" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">pieces of our behavior and our</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">infrastructure our</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">institutions and by the way stepping</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">into a lot of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">change requires actually stepping away</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">from certainty into uncertainty and that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">by itself is uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">and of course if you do that if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.280" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2"> yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">reality well sometimes reality just goes</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">away sometimes it actually works out</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">sometimes the thing that you were trying</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:38.879" style="s2">to avoid thinking about actually does go</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">away and you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.879" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">yeah i got away with it which by the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">reinforces the behavior but generally</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:44.639" style="s2">speaking it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:45.520" style="s2">generally speaking reality is reality it</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.639" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really care how much you</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2"> yourself in fact generally</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:48.800" style="s2">speaking if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">push it yourself you do make matters</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.800" end="00:34:52.240" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">so you know the next day reality comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.240" end="00:34:54.879" style="s2">knocking at the door and says hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">time to change</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.879" end="00:34:58.240" style="s2">and something just went wrong again</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">you&#39;re faced with a choice but now</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.240" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of deeper in</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:03.359" style="s2">because the magnitude of your</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">the the delusional story</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.359" end="00:35:07.599" style="s2">that you begin telling yourself and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:09.520" style="s2">the self the self denial</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.599" end="00:35:11.839" style="s2">and uh the narratives that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.520" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">constructed to enable your</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.839" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">um have a bigger control over where you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:18.079" style="s2">are and you have to actually go</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">through the field you have to feel all</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.079" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">the discomfort that you&#39;ve been delaying</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">at once so instead of being discomfort</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.839" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">of one now it&#39;s just comfort of three</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">so you have a choice you go deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">the rabbit hole and yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">even further or do you suck it up and go</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">through the even bigger bag that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">changed you have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:37.920" style="s2">well generally speaking people will</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2">often choose the first path</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.920" end="00:35:40.960" style="s2">and again if you can get away with it if</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:42.480" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.960" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">throw more it&#39;s just used like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.480" end="00:35:48.000" style="s2">the financial system is a very</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">concrete example in 2008 reality hit us</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.000" end="00:35:49.760" style="s2">and said</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">you guys have been really this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.760" end="00:35:53.119" style="s2">up for a long time the global financial</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">system is</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.119" end="00:35:57.839" style="s2">not functional it&#39;s hyper fragile it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">optimized for efficiency it&#39;s making bad</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.839" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">choices bad resource allocation</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">got to change this in a big way big</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">bank&#39;s got to go</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:07.599" style="s2">probably even centralized banks is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:09.280" style="s2">mechanism they&#39;ve gotta go this whole</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.599" end="00:36:11.200" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.280" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">and our global collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.200" end="00:36:13.599" style="s2">governance system said oh that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">really painful</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.599" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">nope you know i&#39;d rather do i&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:19.599" style="s2">take a double shot of heroin and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:20.960" style="s2">amphetamines can we get a big shot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.599" end="00:36:23.040" style="s2">perimeter amphetamines</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.960" end="00:36:25.119" style="s2">well yes we can okay good let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.040" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.119" end="00:36:28.160" style="s2">um and of course over a period of time i</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">was like well that amphetamines wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.160" end="00:36:32.079" style="s2">enough we need a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:33.119" style="s2">which is like uh putting a load of money</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.079" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">quantitative easing</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.119" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">just basically printing money right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">let&#39;s cut interest rates a quarter point</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:40.079" style="s2">well i didn&#39;t work okay let&#39;s cut it</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:41.680" style="s2">half a point that didn&#39;t work let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.079" end="00:36:42.880" style="s2">to zero interest rates well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.680" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">working anymore let&#39;s go to negative</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.880" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">interest rates</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.280" style="s2">that&#39;s that kind of that cycle and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:48.640" style="s2">point of that stage is that each one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:49.760" style="s2">those decision points was a decision</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.640" end="00:36:50.560" style="s2">point where you could decide either to</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.760" end="00:36:53.040" style="s2"> yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.560" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">more or suck it up and actually go</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.040" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">through the change necessary</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:59.119" style="s2">to get to actual sobriety and so at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:37:02.400" style="s2">level of the financial system</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.119" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">like uh the reality had percolated</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.400" end="00:37:05.520" style="s2">through the crisis had kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">enough to an end that by the time that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.520" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">we were sitting around</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">2014 2015 2016 um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:14.640" style="s2">and our capacity for producing</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:18.560" style="s2">stimulants was strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.640" end="00:37:21.920" style="s2">that we went through a a felt sense of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.560" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">another high but it wasn&#39;t a real thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.920" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">right the underlying damage was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">heavy it&#39;s a little bit like you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:29.760" style="s2">imagine that you were running a race</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">and uh you like fell and sprained your</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.760" end="00:37:33.440" style="s2">ankle really badly</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">um but you just decided to wrap it up</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.440" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">with some tape and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">inject yourself with the combination of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:39.680" style="s2">painkillers and stimulants</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:40.960" style="s2">and just went back running on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.680" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">ankle well</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.960" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re under if you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">under the influence of the painkillers</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">and the stimulants and the the wrap</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:49.040" style="s2">is kind of good enough you might</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">actually be running pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.040" end="00:37:52.800" style="s2">but you&#39;re doing damage to the ankle and</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">when the stimulants and pain codes wear</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.800" end="00:37:54.880" style="s2">off</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">you&#39;re now even worse than you were</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.880" end="00:37:57.680" style="s2">before so that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:37:59.760" style="s2">right now in the financial system</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.680" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">the magnitude of what&#39;s being done right</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.760" end="00:38:03.200" style="s2">now in the u.s and this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">cascade globally of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.200" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">is like a whole step up from everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">that happened in the period between 2008</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">and 2012. like it&#39;s like two or three</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:12.240" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:13.599" style="s2">x already we&#39;re only four or five days</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.240" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">um which is to say that we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">continuing to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">the addict is continuing to choose to</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">update the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">delusional story whatever you do don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">pay attention to what&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:31.440" style="s2">and doubling down on the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:33.440" style="s2">the stimulant the thing that allows the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.440" end="00:38:36.079" style="s2">system to continue to operate as if</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.440" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">reality isn&#39;t what it is uh and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.079" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">eventually</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:40.640" style="s2">as every addict knows you hit rock</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">bottom</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.640" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">um and you always have a choice when you</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:44.880" style="s2">hit rock bottom you have a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">clarity</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.880" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">and the moment of clarity you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">finally choose to just take in to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">into complete acceptance</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:52.640" style="s2">and by the way oftentimes the i believe</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">the story is to uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.640" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">submit to a higher power to surrender</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:58.560" style="s2">and begin to say okay i really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:38:59.599" style="s2">know how to deal with this i need to</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.560" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">actually begin learning from the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.599" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">again and realize i got to take my lumps</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">actually have to grow through</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">the change that has to happen to get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:12.320" style="s2">sobriety and ultimately the health</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">um or you can go right back down to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.320" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">denial cycle until ultimately death</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">right and i think that&#39;s again that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:19.760" style="s2">really good conceptual model as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:20.960" style="s2">done we&#39;ve kind of been moving back and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.760" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">forth between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.960" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">individual human biological example and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">the financial example</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">um and by the way if you&#39;d like you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:32.640" style="s2">transpose this to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:34.960" style="s2">political side for example um</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.640" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">but what would it look like for like if</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.960" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">this is denial what would it actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:39.920" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">to to face reality and what would the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.920" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">changes</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">need to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.000" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">i mean okay just adjust the list rather</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:50.640" style="s2">than maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">kind of yeah yeah but this is something</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.640" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been looking at for now</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.760" end="00:39:54.800" style="s2">again about 15 years so it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">not that in some sense it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.800" end="00:40:00.480" style="s2">mysterious i&#39;ve already already</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:40:03.520" style="s2">laid out most of it yeah the first is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">accept you got a problem let&#39;s do aaa</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.520" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">like the aaa guys have cut it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">kind of wired first except you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">problem like stop</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">denying that you&#39;ve got a problem second</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">begin the process of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">awareness and relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:18.319" style="s2">reality of the problem like begin the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">process of actually stepping into</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.319" end="00:40:22.319" style="s2">reality so in this case for example</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.400" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">i would propose it would be quite</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.319" end="00:40:26.079" style="s2">helpful to have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">collective conscious acceptance of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.079" end="00:40:29.200" style="s2">reality of the medic crisis that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.599" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.200" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">that the thing in front of us the acute</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">is a symptom of a much larger chronic</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">crisis that has been ongoing for a long</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">period of time</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">and to to reach a level of acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">the magnitude of change and in some</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">sense at least the qualities of change</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">that need to occur</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:52.319" style="s2">for example if i&#39;m a baby boomer</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">who has been holding on to the reigns of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.319" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">of particular institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.280" style="s2">i think it&#39;s time to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">generational transfer</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.280" end="00:41:06.240" style="s2">is an actual necessity i think it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">to acknowledge that the reality is is</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.240" end="00:41:10.079" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:11.760" style="s2">i don&#39;t really know what to do and</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.079" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.760" end="00:41:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not my job to know what to do there</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">are other people who are younger than me</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.040" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">that have grown up in completely</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">different environments that have better</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">instincts and better learnings about the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">reality that we currently live in</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:25.760" style="s2">it&#39;s their job to know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">now i may actually have a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">connection to why if i&#39;ve lived life</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">well and full and thoroughly that i</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:31.839" style="s2">actually have developed embodied wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">and i can start trying to</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:38.560" style="s2">present why and this notion of we</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:40.079" style="s2">who we might be like the deep tradition</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.560" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">the deep tradition is still carried in</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.079" end="00:41:42.480" style="s2">my body and the way that young people</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">can&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.480" end="00:41:47.280" style="s2">but the specific strategy and response</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:49.440" style="s2">that we ought to be engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.280" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">okay boomer is a archetypal and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.440" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">practical sign of the reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:53.680" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">you&#39;re out of the loop you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:42:01.200" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">just one example i don&#39;t mean to harsh</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.560" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">on that that&#39;s just a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">two if you happen to be in charge of a</p>

<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">the right response is you actually need</p>

<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">that&#39;s just the reality and i understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">this is not an easy thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">it will be challenging but doing it</p>

<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">it&#39;s just a better idea so if we had</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:45.200" style="s2">back in 2008</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:47.040" style="s2">recognized that the too big to fail the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.200" end="00:42:48.720" style="s2">response to too big to fail banks was no</p>

<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:59.839" style="s2">education want to pick another poison</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">the global education system particularly</p>

<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">top to bottom and this is not a matter</p>

<p begin="00:43:18.319" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">now is the time to really think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.520" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">hitting a reboot on the whole thing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">can we rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">pull together an entirely different</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">approach to education and here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:29.839" style="s2">thing again</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re running the education system</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.839" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what the to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:35.440" style="s2">you&#39;ve been focused on trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">out how to maintain the patient for</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.440" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">so long that you maybe have real amazing</p>

<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">but by definition that means you haven&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:47.119" style="s2">working on the way that you think about</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">things and how to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.119" end="00:43:50.560" style="s2">new possibilities but there are other</p>

<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">is hand the keys over to people who are</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.839" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">consequences but there are people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">are both smart and brave and and many of</p>

<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:22.319" style="s2">kind of let&#39;s rewind all the way back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">the beginning of our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.319" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">there were many people in social media</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:27.680" style="s2">who called this thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:29.839" style="s2">their sense making frameworks their</p>

<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:37.040" style="s2">worked they saw what was happening and</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.680" end="00:44:38.720" style="s2">they actually were able to propose</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.040" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">appropriate responses in a time frame</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.720" end="00:44:40.960" style="s2">where it would have been a very easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">thing to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.960" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to sort of lurch from</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:48.839" style="s2">but the powers that be right now have</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">to give them the keys right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a big deal right and this has</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">already happened though this has</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.680" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">happened in the past</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">in uh the period of world war one and</p>

<p begin="00:45:32.800" end="00:45:36.880" style="s2">were then given the keys and they were</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">able to rebuild an entire global system</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.880" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">that got us all the way to where we are</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.520" end="00:52:31.040" style="s2">the psychology is getting in the way</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">because they&#39;re an artificial bottleneck</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.040" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">working on a broadcast model that</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:35.839" style="s2">insists on</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">everything going through their system</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.839" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s just not they&#39;re not capable</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:42.480" style="s2">of of doing it yeah so remember i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:45.359" style="s2">said this like 15 times over the past</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.480" end="00:52:46.240" style="s2">five or six years publicly the blue</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.359" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">church like which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.240" end="00:52:49.440" style="s2">this particular construct of everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">at the edge having to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.440" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">up to the top to a set of decision</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.319" style="s2">makers to evaluate what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">and then make a set of decisions and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.319" end="00:52:56.480" style="s2">then propagate that set of decisions</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:01.440" style="s2">back down</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.480" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s that approach at its best</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.440" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">couldn&#39;t handle the velocity and</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">complexity of what we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">and it is very very far from being at</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:12.960" style="s2">its best</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:15.359" style="s2">so now let&#39;s take that story and let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.960" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">make it very concrete</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.359" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">testing swabs cdc</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">so here&#39;s the deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">we have a testing methodology we have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">test test kits</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:28.559" style="s2">there are in fact a lot of test kits</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:30.319" style="s2">sitting in hospitals all over the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.559" end="00:53:33.680" style="s2">country</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.319" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">the test kit involves a swab</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.680" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">that swab can pick up lots of things by</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:42.000" style="s2">the way including covet</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">it is entirely physically possible for</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.000" end="00:53:47.359" style="s2">the doctor the hospital at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.960" style="s2">to do a test on that swab and verify</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.359" end="00:53:50.880" style="s2">whether or not the patient being tested</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.960" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">has or does not have</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.880" end="00:53:58.720" style="s2">the disease they aren&#39;t doing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">because the regulation requires them</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:02.640" style="s2">to send that swab up to the cdc to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">tested</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.640" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">and then the data comes back from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:09.040" style="s2">cdc</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.400" style="s2">by the way in true american style what</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.040" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">they could do</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.400" end="00:54:14.480" style="s2">is take two swabs so you&#39;ve got two</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">nostrils</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.480" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">send one up to the cdc and test the own</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">the one in their lab and basically tell</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">the cdc to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:27.760" style="s2">minimum minimum compliance to stupid</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:29.920" style="s2">rules is kind of a good idea right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">in any event that&#39;s a good example right</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.920" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">institutional incapacity why is the cdc</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">holding this obligation which can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.839" end="00:54:44.000" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t have the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">handle the flux of input</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.000" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">and the time delay between you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">shipping something out here and coming</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">is a big deal it&#39;s a real problem why</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:53.920" style="s2">well i mean you could sort of go put on</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:54.960" style="s2">your tinfoil hat and start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.920" end="00:54:58.160" style="s2">conspiracies</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.960" end="00:55:00.720" style="s2">and maybe but more likely</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.160" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">a combination of senescent and fragile</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.720" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">institutional structures</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:09.520" style="s2">and the feedback loop of um</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">fear-based responses and the inability</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.520" end="00:55:14.160" style="s2">to move through the uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">the denial and learning cycles that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.160" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">the most likely explanation</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">something you pointed out that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">really interesting that struck me um</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">that the difference in responses between</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">character types and you mentioned kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">of people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">of the political spectrum like</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">republicans who</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">generally you would expect to be very</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">disease phobic they score much highly on</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">um kind of questions of purity and</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">we&#39;re actually responding very</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">differently and we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:46.799" style="s2">really in denial for a lot longer than</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:48.240" style="s2">people on the other side and there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.799" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">all this narrative about what it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.240" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:53.520" style="s2">it&#39;s just a democrat um fear-mongering</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:54.559" style="s2">it&#39;s just attacking trump and then we</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.520" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">had this</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.559" end="00:55:59.359" style="s2">this sort of catastrophic level of kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">of denial followed by panic</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.359" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">um and then a complete change of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">narrative like you had fox news go from</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">this is all kind of made up to this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">not made up and trump is dealing with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:10.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s a war president in the in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">matter of</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.400" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">kind of hours almost what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:16.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">yeah so i was quite confused by that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.319" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">i think you may we even had</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">on it in social media and somebody gave</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:23.520" style="s2">me uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">the insight that i think is right which</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.520" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">is we&#39;re kind of dealing with a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">a bit of a topsy-turvy unraveling of</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">so two things happening simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">one is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">at least in the us and i think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:39.760" style="s2">broadly</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:41.599" style="s2">among political conservatives among the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">people who are in the right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.599" end="00:56:45.280" style="s2">there is a a well-deserved conventional</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:46.640" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.280" end="00:56:49.280" style="s2">that the mainstream media is not our</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:51.200" style="s2">friend so a</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.280" end="00:56:52.799" style="s2">a visceral response an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.200" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">response that if the mainstream media is</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.799" end="00:56:56.720" style="s2">conveying something particularly</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">convincing with a high degree of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.720" end="00:57:00.160" style="s2">that it&#39;s probably wrong it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:02.160" style="s2">false</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.160" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s yet another example of them</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.160" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">trying to kind of whip up</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">um unconscious response for agendas that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:11.839" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">in my best interest as a person from the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.839" end="00:57:14.799" style="s2">which is to mean to say that they had</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">built over a long period of time a</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.799" end="00:57:18.720" style="s2">detection system</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">and they gave them a false negative</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.720" end="00:57:21.440" style="s2">paint you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.520" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">the boy who cried wolf more or less</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.440" end="00:57:24.640" style="s2">cried wolf 100 times</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:27.280" style="s2">i&#39;ve stopped listening to you oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.640" end="00:57:28.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a wolf back in the vibe</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.280" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">the second thing and kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.799" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">middle is if you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:38.160" style="s2">have at a dispositional level a</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">high orientation towards purity</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.160" end="00:57:45.920" style="s2">and towards strong closed clean borders</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:48.720" style="s2">the gap that you have to get over</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:49.920" style="s2">between this isn&#39;t a problem to it is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.720" end="00:57:52.640" style="s2">problem is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.920" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">high if you have to actually go through</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.640" end="00:57:55.599" style="s2">a whole bunch of oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.000" end="00:57:57.359" style="s2"> this is actually a really big</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.599" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">problem because your your disposition</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.359" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">will perceive this as actually being a</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.160" style="s2">much bigger issue</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">so on the one hand you have this denial</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.160" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">vector which is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:08.720" style="s2"> they cry wolf we know these guys</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">are manipulative lives who don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.720" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">the best interest in mind</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.760" end="00:58:13.920" style="s2">i have heuristic of not listening to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:15.839" style="s2">demand oh if i do listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.920" end="00:58:17.599" style="s2">then this is gonna really be scary and</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.839" end="00:58:18.720" style="s2">bad and i actually feel quite powerless</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.599" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">because i don&#39;t have any way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.720" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">responding to the violation of our</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">boundaries and purity at this level</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:27.040" style="s2">so this kind of reinforces a delusionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:29.119" style="s2">denial mindset</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.040" end="00:58:31.040" style="s2">that was perfectly actually and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.119" end="00:58:32.559" style="s2">also when you hit when you hit when you</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.040" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">hit the moment of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">when something hits and usually by the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">way it goes at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:39.040" style="s2">leaders like it&#39;s like when tucker</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">carlson who has a lot of people like</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.040" end="00:58:42.400" style="s2">he&#39;s he doesn&#39;t fit this</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">criteria we trust tucker on the right</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.400" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">trucker&#39;s like oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:46.400" style="s2">if he says something he&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:48.000" style="s2">the kind of guy he&#39;s actually several</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.400" end="00:58:49.520" style="s2">times over the past couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.000" end="00:58:51.040" style="s2">spoken truth to power from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.520" end="00:58:52.319" style="s2">view of the right in a way that feels</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.040" end="00:58:55.599" style="s2">like it&#39;s even more honest</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.319" end="00:58:58.160" style="s2">so when he says no it&#39;s a big deal</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.599" end="00:58:58.880" style="s2">pay attention then suddenly it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.160" end="00:59:00.319" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:58:58.880" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">i can&#39;t go with the boy who cries wolf</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.319" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">he&#39;s not the boy who cries wolf</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:05.920" style="s2">now i got to go through the denial thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">and figure out how to adjust the reality</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.920" end="00:59:07.520" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">but then you kind of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.520" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">construct flips and then you settle into</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:13.040" style="s2">the base</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:14.480" style="s2">which is conservatives respond as a oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.040" end="00:59:15.440" style="s2"> this is a violation of purity and</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.480" end="00:59:17.119" style="s2">integrity and now</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.440" end="00:59:18.960" style="s2">we it&#39;s a crisis like so it moves from</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.119" end="00:59:20.079" style="s2">denial to crisis pretty quickly</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.960" end="00:59:22.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re landing in kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.079" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">natural disposition</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.240" end="00:59:27.440" style="s2">yeah that feels right and the other part</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">is just the motivated reasoning of</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.440" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">like on both on all sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:33.280" style="s2">political spectrum you just see people</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">intuit what the end game would be if</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.280" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">this was true</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:39.119" style="s2">therefore it can&#39;t be true for example</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">the end game being there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.119" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">big hit to the economy and that will</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">harm</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">trump&#39;s re-election chances therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:46.160" style="s2">cannot be true</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.079" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">if you think about it it&#39;s a fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.280" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">psychological mechanism because it means</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:57.599" style="s2">that subconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">we are able to play that out without</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.599" end="01:00:00.160" style="s2">being conscious of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:01.599" style="s2">and then refuse to play it out</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.160" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">consciously because we&#39;ve realized where</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.599" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">it would go if we actually did it</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">yep happens all the time right when you</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:09.520" style="s2">uh you know you you walk somebody</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:11.280" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.520" end="01:00:12.720" style="s2">you know you&#39;re sitting in a city that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">has a you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.720" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">a plant like a chemical plant</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">and you&#39;re talking about the negative</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">impacts of the chemical plants</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:23.839" style="s2">operations on the the local river</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.440" style="s2">you keep it very tactical yeah we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.839" end="01:00:26.880" style="s2">the river and the water supply and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.440" end="01:00:27.839" style="s2">fish and the frogs and the chemicals</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.880" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">that are being output in the river</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.839" end="01:00:30.400" style="s2">having these consequences</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.000" style="s2">and smart people are paying attention</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.400" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">they&#39;re nodding yep yep yep you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.000" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">show you do you see these curves and how</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">that works</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">yep get it and also there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:41.119" style="s2">where suddenly the conclusion is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:42.720" style="s2">i&#39;m going to lose my job and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.119" end="01:00:44.480" style="s2">retcon of the entire</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.720" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">and suddenly things that they had agreed</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.480" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">to explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.000" style="s2">15 minutes before they are now disputing</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:52.079" style="s2">with the absolute level of uh</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.000" end="01:00:53.760" style="s2">with vigor so yeah that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.079" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">that&#39;s a real thing that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.760" end="01:00:56.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a big deal right and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:57.599" style="s2">actually kind of important to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.319" end="01:00:59.040" style="s2">that that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.599" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">and recognize that that whole cycle is</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.040" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">part of the cycle like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">good enough to have done this</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:06.319" style="s2">cognitively you kind of have to absorb</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">the implications in a full body sense if</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.319" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">you have to actually process</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">the whole implication the whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">consequence and you have to do it by the</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:12.240" style="s2">way not just here but all the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:15.440" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.240" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">i just had to have your response</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.440" end="01:01:19.440" style="s2">and not have gotten stuck in any level</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">of denial i go through the whole process</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.440" end="01:01:22.000" style="s2">and not had a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">piece of you say ah i don&#39;t want to deal</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.000" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">with that i&#39;ll go into denial now</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.240" style="s2">really you know integrate the whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:30.880" style="s2">thing then you&#39;re fully in acceptance</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.240" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">then you can go through it yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.880" end="01:01:34.240" style="s2">an interesting story that really fits</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:36.559" style="s2">with this that i heard earlier today</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.240" end="01:01:37.920" style="s2">a friend of mine called dougald hein</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.559" end="01:01:39.680" style="s2">talked about how he had a meeting with</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.920" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">the government during the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.680" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">swine flu crisis in the uk i think it</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:44.559" style="s2">was swine flu or it might have been foot</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:46.079" style="s2">and mouth i can&#39;t i think it might have</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.559" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">been foot and mouth actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.079" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">yeah yeah the meeting with the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">government advisor and outlined</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:54.720" style="s2">what it meant there was a big outbreak</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">in in mexico and he kind of explained</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.720" end="01:01:57.359" style="s2">what it</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">and then midway through the meeting</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.359" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">after about an hour he realized he</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:01.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t arguing what with with someone</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">who was trying to decide what the right</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.920" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">thing was to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:07.680" style="s2">it was what is the most that i can sell</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">to the media</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.680" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">and that that for me feels like a very</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:15.039" style="s2">um a very deep systemic floor and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.240" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">what i&#39;m paying</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.039" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">particular attention to at the moment in</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">the uk like the uk strategy</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:24.880" style="s2">seems almost entirely based on that like</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:26.480" style="s2">if we signal panic now having signaled</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.880" end="01:02:28.640" style="s2">that we&#39;re kind of quite easy and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.480" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about herd immunity if we</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.640" end="01:02:32.559" style="s2">signal panic now</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">it will invalidate like what will the</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.559" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">media think of us and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.480" style="s2">that that to me feels like a very deep</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:40.079" style="s2">if you you outline</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.480" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">china as being the opposite of that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.079" end="01:02:42.880" style="s2">like i don&#39;t give a because public</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">opinion is</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.880" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">is completely irrelevant and russia is</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">the same</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:49.280" style="s2">but that seems to be a deep systemic</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.599" style="s2">flaw with</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.280" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">representative democracy that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.599" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">feel they can level with us</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">uh about reality and therefore there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">kind of untruth built into the system</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s a there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">responsibility on the media there</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:05.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">the media often will overplay things and</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.839" end="01:03:08.559" style="s2">so you get these sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:09.760" style="s2">failure conditions where no one feels</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.559" end="01:03:10.880" style="s2">they can be honest because they&#39;ll freak</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.760" end="01:03:13.039" style="s2">people out</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.880" end="01:03:14.880" style="s2">and then then everyone&#39;s just making</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.039" end="01:03:15.599" style="s2">decisions based on what will be thought</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.880" end="01:03:18.240" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.599" end="01:03:19.280" style="s2">and the rather than the the decisions in</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.240" end="01:03:21.359" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.280" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">it&#39;s like artificiality does that work</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.359" end="01:03:24.880" style="s2">is that sort of you&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:27.920" style="s2">baudrillard&#39;s idea of simulation</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.880" end="01:03:29.119" style="s2">yeah is that the process that he talked</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.920" end="01:03:30.480" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.119" end="01:03:32.240" style="s2">um well he doesn&#39;t talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.480" end="01:03:33.599" style="s2">reverse definitely talk about that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.240" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">yeah and i think that&#39;s right that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.599" end="01:03:35.920" style="s2">very good frame i mean it&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:38.720" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.920" end="01:03:39.839" style="s2">philosophically intense to use as a a a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.720" end="01:03:41.440" style="s2">frame but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.839" end="01:03:43.920" style="s2">so but i think we can actually make it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.440" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">reasonably again concrete</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.920" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">and actually throughout the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:47.599" style="s2">wartime president i think that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:48.880" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.599" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">there&#39;s just a difference between peace</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.880" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">time and wartime</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.079" style="s2">um and one of the problems of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:55.680" style="s2">this with peace time is that this notion</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.079" end="01:03:57.760" style="s2">of simulation</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.680" end="01:03:58.880" style="s2">can work and in many cases actually not</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.760" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">necessarily the worst</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.880" end="01:04:05.760" style="s2">thing to do um there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">an intuition and a practicality of</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.760" end="01:04:10.960" style="s2">managing the crisis</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:11.680" style="s2">how do i keep people from panicking how</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.960" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">do i stay</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">in control it&#39;s funny like as i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:16.640" style="s2">this at the level of like political</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">sociology think about it from the level</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.640" end="01:04:21.119" style="s2">of individual psychology as well</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:22.079" style="s2">how do i stay in control how do i make</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.119" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">sure that</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.079" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">the things that i want to happen happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">the way i want them to happen</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">and of course what happens is like if</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.000" end="01:04:34.720" style="s2">you&#39;re boris johnson or the trump</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">administration or</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">you know the opposite number on the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:39.599" style="s2">other side of the aisle or any you know</p>

<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">look good i&#39;ve got to think about my</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:52.720" style="s2">all these different characteristics of</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to manage</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:57.680" style="s2">and the method that i&#39;m trying to use</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">is this notion of managing other</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.680" end="01:05:01.440" style="s2">people&#39;s perceptions</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:03.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the key managing other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.440" end="01:05:06.480" style="s2">perceptions is the tool</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.200" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">that is selected for in a in a peacetime</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.480" end="01:05:10.480" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:11.440" style="s2">in an environment where um broderiad</p>

<p begin="01:05:11.440" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">level two or level three or level four</p>

<p begin="01:05:17.680" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">that come back to me at the level of</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:24.160" style="s2">society at the level of human</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:25.440" style="s2">humans are significantly more meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.160" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">than the reality that comes back to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.440" end="01:05:29.039" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">nature through reality so it is worth</p>

<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">not outlining completely but just that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:35.680" style="s2">baudrillard level two three and four are</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">just increasing levelers</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.680" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">levels of artificiality in the system or</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:41.520" style="s2">dis</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">or deceit and dishonesty it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.520" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">like almost like</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:48.880" style="s2">distance from nature and an embeddedness</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">of increasingly kind of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.880" end="01:05:51.920" style="s2">dominated by the about</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">by how humans do things so you might</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.920" end="01:05:56.480" style="s2">imagine like um</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:57.520" style="s2">i&#39;m somebody who lives out in the woods</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.480" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">by myself</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.520" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">and my pipe breaks that&#39;s kind of level</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">zero</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">i am hands on directly with reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">physical reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.880" style="s2">and the pipe doesn&#39;t give him what</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:09.520" style="s2">story i tell myself i either fixed it or</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.880" end="01:06:13.599" style="s2">i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.520" end="01:06:17.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s very simple okay layer two</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.599" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">um i i call a plumber</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.599" end="01:06:23.839" style="s2">and so both my capacity for agency</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:25.440" style="s2">of actually solving the problem and in</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.839" end="01:06:26.799" style="s2">some sense my capacity perception</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.440" end="01:06:29.920" style="s2">of knowing whether the problem was</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.799" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">solved adequately is mediated by another</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.920" end="01:06:33.520" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">so narrative enters into it right i have</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.520" end="01:06:36.720" style="s2">to find some social mechanism in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">case money by the way as a variation on</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.720" end="01:06:39.760" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:40.400" style="s2">i have to find some social mechanism of</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.760" end="01:06:43.440" style="s2">getting this</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.400" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">other human to do a thing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.440" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">the simulation level one right narrative</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:48.079" style="s2">actually now becomes more important for</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:51.680" style="s2">my success</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.079" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">than direct relationship with nature</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.680" end="01:06:56.480" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go to level level two um i</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">don&#39;t even know plumber</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.480" end="01:06:59.280" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t even know what to tell the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">plumber i have to call the supervisor</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.280" end="01:07:02.640" style="s2">the super of the building i have yet</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">another person</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.640" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">um and the super by the way i have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:08.960" style="s2">convince the super</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:10.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s a good idea i&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.960" end="01:07:12.559" style="s2">whole sort of back and forth</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.559" end="01:07:14.240" style="s2">set of political dynamics and layers</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.559" end="01:07:15.920" style="s2">where um</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.240" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">the super is busy and the super&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.920" end="01:07:18.559" style="s2">different values and maybe this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:19.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t an issue for the super to deal</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.559" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.039" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:27.920" style="s2">squeaky faucet it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a leak</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.319" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">hey i need the plumber to come fix my i</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.920" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">need somebody to come fix my faucet</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:32.480" style="s2">and i have to go through this political</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">mechanism mechanization we have to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.480" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">performative signaling and political</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">maneuvering i got to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:39.599" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:41.119" style="s2">manage the perceptions of this agent who</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.599" end="01:07:42.559" style="s2">themselves then has to manage the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.119" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">perceptions of an agent so i&#39;m like two</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.559" end="01:07:47.920" style="s2">degrees away from me</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.319" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">okay let&#39;s go to layer three um</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.920" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">now we&#39;re in the in the fact that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">in a layer where</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:56.400" style="s2">storytelling is the medium so like i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:07:58.559" style="s2">journalist</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.400" end="01:07:59.520" style="s2">so what i&#39;m doing is i&#39;m actually the</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.559" end="01:08:02.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not dealing with now</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.520" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">a a problem in physical reality i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.400" end="01:08:05.760" style="s2">dealing with a problem in</p>

<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:23.359" style="s2">probably talking to the super</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">they may be talking to the poor bastard</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">got the politician</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:43.520" style="s2">and the politician is communicating not</p>

<p begin="01:08:43.520" end="01:08:47.040" style="s2">not to plumbers and definitely not to</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:48.719" style="s2">pipes but to the media</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.040" end="01:08:50.480" style="s2">right and of course what happens when</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.719" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">you&#39;re in that level of depth</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.480" end="01:08:53.839" style="s2">the the niche what it means to be</p>

<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:03.440" style="s2">highly salient the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">our sense-making system</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.440" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">human perception thinks is important and</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:09.920" style="s2">true but not necessarily at all</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:11.199" style="s2">relevant right can i tell a good story</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.920" end="01:09:13.520" style="s2">is the story</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.199" end="01:09:15.279" style="s2">compelling you know is it a would it</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.520" end="01:09:16.880" style="s2">sell in hollywood that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.279" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">and it&#39;s perception management 101 so</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.880" end="01:09:19.359" style="s2">i&#39;m actually kind of in real time trying</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:21.199" style="s2">to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.359" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">what&#39;s the movie and when i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.199" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">political operator instead of level four</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">and when the whole culture is now kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">of sitting in level four because we</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t none of us are connected to</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:32.000" style="s2">to the pipe um now we&#39;re in bed we are</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.880" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">level four</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.000" end="01:09:36.080" style="s2">and um sorry we went a long way down</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">that path but</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.080" end="01:09:41.040" style="s2">i wanted to use that as a metaphor but</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:44.400" style="s2">the point is um</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.040" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">wartime peacetime so</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.400" end="01:09:50.960" style="s2">in the peacetime army and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:54.239" style="s2">peacetime civilization the peacetime</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.960" end="01:09:55.760" style="s2">country this movement towards this top</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.239" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">of the stack or deeper into the</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.760" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">beautiful environment</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:01.920" style="s2">is it can be done you can kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:04.080" style="s2">you could be more successful you will be</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.920" end="01:10:07.360" style="s2">more successful in virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.080" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">than being virtuous if i could if other</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.360" end="01:10:10.719" style="s2">people believe i&#39;m a hero</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.040" end="01:10:12.880" style="s2">is much more important than whether i am</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.719" end="01:10:15.840" style="s2">a hero and by the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.880" end="01:10:16.960" style="s2">if i am a hero if i blow the whistle the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.840" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">whistleblower</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">i might just be thrown in jail so</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.679" end="01:10:24.080" style="s2">bizarrely enough</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">actual virtue is oftentimes punished and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.080" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">virtue signaling</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:28.159" style="s2">is oftentimes rewarded and this is what</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:32.239" style="s2">creates corruption</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.159" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">in the choice making system war</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.239" end="01:10:35.679" style="s2">in this metaphor and more practically in</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">many cases is when reality comes</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.679" end="01:10:39.040" style="s2">rushing back to hit you in the face it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">that moment of clarity and level of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.040" end="01:10:44.480" style="s2">simulation</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">um you know the the general who is</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.480" end="01:10:47.360" style="s2">very very good at spinning things to</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:48.800" style="s2">make himself look good but the end of</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.360" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">the day is incompetent</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:52.239" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know if you know the history</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.719" style="s2">of world war ii but manages the battle</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.239" end="01:10:55.920" style="s2">of kasserine pass where the american</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.719" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">the american army for the very first</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.920" end="01:10:58.719" style="s2">time met the german army in north africa</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:02.159" style="s2">and got</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.719" end="01:11:03.360" style="s2"> um well a whole bunch of dead</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.159" end="01:11:06.320" style="s2">people and burned down tanks</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.360" end="01:11:07.679" style="s2">is kind of hard to spin when people care</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.320" end="01:11:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re paying close attention like oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.679" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2"> like no you up dude you must</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.760" end="01:11:13.440" style="s2">be a shitty general</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:15.040" style="s2">and this could actually that that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.440" end="01:11:16.159" style="s2">kind of do that forward projection oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.040" end="01:11:17.440" style="s2"> this could actually end up with</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.159" end="01:11:18.560" style="s2">like the germans winning the war this</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.440" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">would be a bad thing like you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.560" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.880" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t like i don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:22.880" style="s2">consequences of having shitty generals</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.880" end="01:11:26.239" style="s2">i need to stop having shitty generals oh</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:28.320" style="s2">how do i get rid of shitty generals</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.239" end="01:11:29.440" style="s2">and so you begin to relearn the process</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.320" end="01:11:30.719" style="s2">of at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.440" end="01:11:32.400" style="s2">you actually have to know whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.719" end="01:11:32.880" style="s2">the pipe&#39;s going to burst and try to fix</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.400" end="01:11:35.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.880" end="01:11:36.800" style="s2">and so kind of these cycles of at a</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.280" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">meta-systemic level of going through a</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.800" end="01:11:39.600" style="s2">process of kind of going into the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.400" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">simulation</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.600" end="01:11:43.120" style="s2">and separating virtue and virtue</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.800" style="s2">signaling and then coming back from the</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.120" end="01:11:47.040" style="s2">simulation and rapidly learning the</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.800" end="01:11:48.880" style="s2">virtue of signaling is oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.040" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">the best virtue signals are almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.880" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">certainly the least virtuous people</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:53.760" style="s2">because they&#39;ve been optimizing for</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:55.520" style="s2">simulation</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.760" end="01:11:57.280" style="s2">and the most virtuous people oftentimes</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.520" end="01:11:58.640" style="s2">are awkward virtue signalers</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.280" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">they look shitty</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.640" end="01:12:02.320" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually really good and so</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:03.120" style="s2">reorienting your capacity to make that</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.320" end="01:12:04.480" style="s2">discernment</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.120" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">and then making your choice go you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.480" end="01:12:11.040" style="s2">what people who are actually engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:12.880" style="s2">personally damaging heroic activities</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:14.080" style="s2">have to be supported and rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.880" end="01:12:15.199" style="s2">otherwise we&#39;re all going to go down</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.080" end="01:12:17.679" style="s2">with the ship</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.199" end="01:12:19.040" style="s2">that&#39;s that evolution yeah this has been</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.679" end="01:12:21.840" style="s2">a fantastic conversation</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.040" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">i just like to round it off with you</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.840" end="01:12:26.239" style="s2">mentioned war</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:28.320" style="s2">wartime and i i used to be a uh producer</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.239" end="01:12:30.480" style="s2">for channel four news i was in</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.320" end="01:12:33.040" style="s2">uh libya the i mean the most intense</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.480" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">environment that i was in was in misrata</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.040" end="01:12:38.400" style="s2">uh when it was sealed off and we</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">we were there basically the only way in</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.400" end="01:12:41.360" style="s2">was by boat gaddafi&#39;s army was attacking</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">it</p>

<p begin="01:12:44.000" end="01:12:48.560" style="s2">had just been killed so it was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.920" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">very heated they had kind of bombs</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.560" end="01:12:51.920" style="s2">dropping on the city</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:54.080" style="s2">i didn&#39;t i don&#39;t know if i enjoyed it i</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.920" end="01:12:55.360" style="s2">i was in kind of combat zone a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.080" end="01:12:59.040" style="s2">times after that</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.360" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">and i and i have to say the feeling</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.040" end="01:13:02.080" style="s2">the feeling that it that i was feeling</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">in london</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">this last this last week of sort of ram</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.520" end="01:13:08.960" style="s2">ratcheting up of tension and attention</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:10.960" style="s2">and kind of more and more</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.960" end="01:13:12.080" style="s2">increased super awareness of kind of is</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.960" end="01:13:14.480" style="s2">that person coughing</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.080" end="01:13:16.239" style="s2">and like just just this kind of also</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.480" end="01:13:16.800" style="s2">increased awareness of just the tension</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.239" end="01:13:19.360" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.800" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">of everyone around me and then your kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.360" end="01:13:24.159" style="s2">of nervous system starts to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:25.040" style="s2">speed up and you&#39;re uh felt very very</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.159" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.040" end="01:13:28.800" style="s2">like it felt like let&#39;s let&#39;s define war</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">i think i think i think what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.800" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">saying is actually very very right now</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">actually it also it&#39;s this sort of sense</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.360" style="s2">of something coming in through your paws</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:39.120" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.360" end="01:13:40.000" style="s2">right this this sense of like intensity</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.120" end="01:13:41.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.000" end="01:13:43.040" style="s2">that there&#39;s enough what i&#39;m going to do</p>

<p begin="01:13:43.040" end="01:13:45.760" style="s2">an amazing interview with a guy who made</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.880" end="01:13:47.360" style="s2">a film</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.760" end="01:13:48.719" style="s2">he&#39;s an israeli film director he made a</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.360" end="01:13:50.000" style="s2">film about the lebanon war that he</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.719" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">experienced</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.000" end="01:13:54.000" style="s2">and he was a he was a tank gunner in</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:56.080" style="s2">that war and he made a film</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.000" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">where you are stuck inside the tank for</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.080" end="01:13:59.520" style="s2">the whole two hours of the film to try</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:01.679" style="s2">and convey what it</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.520" end="01:14:03.760" style="s2">felt like and he talked beautifully and</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.679" end="01:14:06.159" style="s2">lyrically about</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.760" end="01:14:07.760" style="s2">how war gets into every pore of your</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.159" end="01:14:09.440" style="s2">body and how it just</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.760" end="01:14:11.360" style="s2">becomes this all-encompassing thing i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.440" end="01:14:12.880" style="s2">put a link in the show notes to this</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.360" end="01:14:14.640" style="s2">interview because it&#39;s amazing he talked</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.880" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">about it beautifully sorry you you go</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.640" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">oh great yeah so so what i want to do is</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:19.120" style="s2">i want to say okay let&#39;s use that but</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:21.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.120" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">let&#39;s use it use it rightly and we do we</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.600" end="01:14:26.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want to overly map</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.840" end="01:14:30.159" style="s2">war so things like tanks</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.960" end="01:14:33.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s kind of a good example</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.159" end="01:14:35.600" style="s2">uh world war ii vietnam uh libya these</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.679" end="01:14:40.000" style="s2">are good examples of war but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.600" end="01:14:43.040" style="s2">the whole of war war is when</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.000" end="01:14:43.760" style="s2">choices are being made in very high</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:47.199" style="s2">levels of</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.760" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">uncertainty where the consequences will</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.199" end="01:14:50.640" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:54.159" style="s2">very real and oftentimes very</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.640" end="01:14:56.320" style="s2">rapid that&#39;s war that&#39;s what war is</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.159" end="01:14:58.560" style="s2">where is that situation and</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.320" end="01:15:00.480" style="s2">so in some sense we&#39;re fighting we find</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.560" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">ourselves in a wartime posture often</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.480" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like the exact inverse of addiction</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:07.520" style="s2">the exact inverse of denial</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:08.640" style="s2">like your choices matter right now like</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.520" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.640" end="01:15:13.199" style="s2">buy food two or three weeks ago</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.840" end="01:15:15.199" style="s2">you&#39;re showing up at grocery stores</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.199" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">going what just happened</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.199" end="01:15:19.199" style="s2">and so your choice back then was</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.840" end="01:15:21.280" style="s2">uncertain</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.199" end="01:15:22.960" style="s2">should i be buying food too now why that</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.280" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">makes no sense it&#39;s no good ideas you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.960" end="01:15:26.080" style="s2">uncertain</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:27.520" style="s2">and it matters now you may actually find</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.080" end="01:15:28.560" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have enough food</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.520" end="01:15:31.520" style="s2">which you might be feeling a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.560" end="01:15:32.719" style="s2">concerned about right now and rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.520" end="01:15:35.280" style="s2">two weeks you found out whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.719" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">your choice was a good one that&#39;s war</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.280" end="01:15:39.840" style="s2">and in our environment as the magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:42.480" style="s2">of that goes up right so</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.840" end="01:15:43.679" style="s2">not having enough you know ho hos is not</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.480" end="01:15:45.440" style="s2">that much of a problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.679" end="01:15:46.800" style="s2">and being shot at is a big problem and</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.440" end="01:15:48.000" style="s2">being shot at by malevolent actors who</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.800" end="01:15:49.120" style="s2">are good at what they do is even bigger</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.000" end="01:15:51.760" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.120" end="01:15:52.880" style="s2">um but we&#39;re facing a situation where</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.760" end="01:15:56.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.880" end="01:15:58.640" style="s2">the uncertainty is growing</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.000" end="01:15:59.920" style="s2">the magnitude of the consequences is</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.640" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">growing</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.920" end="01:16:04.719" style="s2">and the speed of the choices is</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:06.400" style="s2">accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.719" end="01:16:08.320" style="s2">that&#39;s why people are having a visceral</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.400" end="01:16:09.840" style="s2">sense of oh wait particularly anybody</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.320" end="01:16:11.679" style="s2">who&#39;s actually been in combat</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.840" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">yeah okay this feels like that because</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.679" end="01:16:15.360" style="s2">it is that it&#39;s just happening in a way</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:17.520" style="s2">that we&#39;re not familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.360" end="01:16:18.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not being nobody&#39;s gonna drop a</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.520" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">nuke</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.480" end="01:16:22.320" style="s2">on manhattan but the net net</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:24.560" style="s2">consequences of the entire systemic</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.320" end="01:16:25.600" style="s2">uh envelope unfolding may be very</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.560" end="01:16:27.120" style="s2">similar and</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.600" end="01:16:28.640" style="s2">at the edge like at the edge of what</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.120" end="01:16:30.320" style="s2">could happen here there may be a</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.640" end="01:16:31.679" style="s2">situation where for example</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.320" end="01:16:34.960" style="s2">you know the streets of rome right now</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.679" end="01:16:38.159" style="s2">are more or less empty</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.960" end="01:16:39.760" style="s2">the collapse of rome back in uh i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.159" end="01:16:40.800" style="s2">800 or so</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.760" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">do you know that story like this is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.800" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">actually the kind of thing that people</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:45.679" style="s2">really need to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:47.040" style="s2">sorry this is way too there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.679" end="01:16:50.080" style="s2">going on here i hope this isn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.040" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">overload i hate overwhelming people but</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.080" end="01:16:55.199" style="s2">so in like 500 a.d something like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.040" end="01:16:55.679" style="s2">maybe 400 400 a.d the population of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.199" end="01:16:58.080" style="s2">city of</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.679" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">rome ancient rome was 1.2 million people</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.080" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">more or less</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:04.000" style="s2">300 years later without the use of</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:04.400" style="s2">nuclear weapons right it&#39;s just the use</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.000" end="01:17:06.480" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.400" end="01:17:08.159" style="s2">systemic collapse across a wide variety</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.480" end="01:17:10.480" style="s2">of different uh fronts</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.159" end="01:17:12.880" style="s2">the population had gone down to like ten</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.480" end="01:17:14.640" style="s2">thousand people</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.880" end="01:17:16.960" style="s2">three years of magnitude from 1.2</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.640" end="01:17:18.880" style="s2">million to 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.960" end="01:17:21.679" style="s2">over what is effectively a very short</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.880" end="01:17:25.199" style="s2">period of time and then it stayed there</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.679" end="01:17:28.840" style="s2">until 1939.</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.199" end="01:17:31.199" style="s2">that&#39;s what systemic collapse looks like</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.840" end="01:17:31.760" style="s2">now i&#39;m not saying that necessarily that</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.199" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">will happen</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.760" end="01:17:35.440" style="s2">here but the point is if if you realize</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">that topologically</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.440" end="01:17:39.840" style="s2">this idea of uncertainty</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:45.600" style="s2">velocity and magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.480" end="01:17:47.280" style="s2">by magnitude i mean the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.600" end="01:17:48.960" style="s2">reality really happens the choices</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.280" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">really have consequences</p>
