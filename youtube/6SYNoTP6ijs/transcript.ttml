<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:09.059" style="s2">that still works for the light because</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.410" end="00:00:13.200" style="s2">were feels to me okay and one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.059" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">in the I was absolutely delighted to see</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.200" end="00:00:19.680" style="s2">that extinction rebellion when they had</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">their first major action and London and</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.680" end="00:00:24.869" style="s2">they were putting out the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:28.230" style="s2">extinction rebellion which I think are</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.869" end="00:00:30.359" style="s2">all very sound principles they they also</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.230" end="00:00:31.710" style="s2">chose one which which is very close to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.359" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">my heart having written a book called</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.710" end="00:00:36.120" style="s2">designing regenerative cultures that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:39.719" style="s2">called we need a regenerative culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.120" end="00:00:41.309" style="s2">and then it even said the way described</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.719" end="00:00:43.320" style="s2">what a regenerative culture is a culture</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.309" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">that is healthy resilient and adaptable</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.320" end="00:00:49.410" style="s2">is a direct quote out of my book but the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:51.180" style="s2">difference what they did in quoting from</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.410" end="00:00:53.940" style="s2">the book which I&#39;m happy about about</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.180" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">that I did is they dropped the s they</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.940" end="00:00:59.460" style="s2">dropped the plural of regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:01:01.289" style="s2">cultures and said we need a regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.460" end="00:01:04.589" style="s2">culture and then they started</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.289" end="00:01:07.770" style="s2">communicating with all the networks that</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.589" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">are popping up around the world in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.770" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">way but really in each one of those</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:16.259" style="s2">places that regenerative culture will</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:18.689" style="s2">look slightly different so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.259" end="00:01:20.750" style="s2">really important to keep the plural</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.689" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">otherwise we have a form of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.750" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">colonialization again we&#39;re a mainly UK</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">led initiative that spreads around the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">globe is putting one particular form of</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">regenerative culture and they also sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">of collapsed it in two important things</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.390" style="s2">the the culture care of within the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:41.340" style="s2">movement how do we support it other each</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.390" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">other how to support a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.340" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">communication that is this so people</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:47.759" style="s2">don&#39;t burn out and they&#39;re people and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">that there&#39;s less conflict all of this</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.759" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">is key to building a movement but</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">regenerative cultures is so much more</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">regenerative cultures is actually did</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:59.399" style="s2">positive answer of saying we need an</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">extinction rebellion and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.399" end="00:02:02.719" style="s2">now need to join the regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:06.869" style="s2">build regenerative cultures everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.719" end="00:02:12.370" style="s2">so so it&#39;s so for me to open up the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.869" end="00:02:14.440" style="s2">conversation around what like</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.370" end="00:02:16.269" style="s2">from talking just about regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.440" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">culture with reading with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.269" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">internal focus of how do we build the XR</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:27.220" style="s2">movement and the climate response</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:29.650" style="s2">movement to going we need to take this</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.220" end="00:02:31.959" style="s2">energy and transform it into being the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.650" end="00:02:34.540" style="s2">regeneration rising and do our deep</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.959" end="00:02:38.170" style="s2">adaptation work in place which will have</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.540" end="00:02:41.799" style="s2">the dual function of preparing us to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.170" end="00:02:45.519" style="s2">able to withstand collapse in economic</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.799" end="00:02:48.819" style="s2">social and ecological systems that we</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.519" end="00:02:50.709" style="s2">are in better because we&#39;ve built local</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.819" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">resilience and we built the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.709" end="00:02:55.870" style="s2">collaborate and we built like we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.940" style="s2">the positive deep adaptation but at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.870" end="00:03:00.610" style="s2">same time these actions could actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.940" end="00:03:02.920" style="s2">if done well at a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.610" end="00:03:06.519" style="s2">everywhere with diverse regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.920" end="00:03:09.430" style="s2">cultures in place doing it proudly</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.519" end="00:03:10.569" style="s2">expressing a difference to how somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.430" end="00:03:12.489" style="s2">else do that does it somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.569" end="00:03:14.709" style="s2">because it&#39;s that place talking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.489" end="00:03:16.989" style="s2">being expressed then we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.709" end="00:03:19.000" style="s2">building a system that might take us</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.989" end="00:03:21.450" style="s2">through the eye of the needle and build</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.000" end="00:03:24.700" style="s2">the world that takes us away from</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.450" end="00:03:27.100" style="s2">extinction and creates collaborative</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.700" end="00:03:30.700" style="s2">abundance and creates that evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.100" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">leap where humanity moves from being</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.700" end="00:03:35.799" style="s2">exploitative and degenerative to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">becoming a healing and regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.799" end="00:03:42.780" style="s2">influence on the ecosystems the bio</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">regions we we live in and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.780" end="00:03:48.099" style="s2">through doing this by scaling out doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">it community by community by a region by</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.099" end="00:03:54.190" style="s2">by origin in the diversity of cultures</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:56.650" style="s2">plura that&#39;s how we heal ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.190" end="00:03:59.049" style="s2">we heal the planet rather than creating</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.650" end="00:04:01.239" style="s2">this is the answer and now we need to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.049" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">put it out to our networks all over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.239" end="00:04:04.799" style="s2">globe that would be a really big mistake</p>
