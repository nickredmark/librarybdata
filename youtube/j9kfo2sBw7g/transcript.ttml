<p begin="00:01:08.640" end="00:01:12.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.200" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">international relations going back about</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.400" end="00:01:17.280" style="s2">a decade ago to when i</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:20.640" style="s2">left the university system</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.280" end="00:01:22.240" style="s2">um and i was interested in this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.640" end="00:01:24.960" style="s2">metamodernism since then</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.240" end="00:01:26.799" style="s2">because i was very prone to meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.960" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">perspectives through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:30.079" style="s2">meta theory that i was working on and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.079" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">the sort of cultural turn we&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:35.759" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.960" style="s2">my own experiences with psychedelics and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:38.799" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.960" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">and just a lifelong passion for</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:42.399" style="s2">philosophy so</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">there&#39;s all those intersections and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">kind of see myself as</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.079" style="s2">art sociologist part artist because i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">made a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.079" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">made a film about abstraction about</p>

<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">which is a satire in which i encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">john to watch</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">to understand the whole breadth of my</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">and i&#39;ve written a lot sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">non-fiction about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">abstraction as a philosophy as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">as a critique of society um</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">as a critique of capital in fact um</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">and i you know have crossed paths with</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.200" end="00:02:20.720" style="s2">john in</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">several spaces we were both in the side</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.720" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">view together</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">and he had come into hanzi frank&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">mailing list before that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:33.200" style="s2">and of course i&#39;ve seen some of his</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">other content and i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.200" end="00:02:37.440" style="s2">different circles</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:40.800" style="s2">are different adjacent spaces overlap</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.440" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">like one is you know has a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.800" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">relationship with people like jordan</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.239" style="s2">hall but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:47.120" style="s2">john himself isn&#39;t too involved with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.239" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.120" end="00:02:51.120" style="s2">discourse which i&#39;ve criticized and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.120" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve you know participated in so</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:59.760" style="s2">um yeah we&#39;re all neighbors in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:01.519" style="s2">sense and i i reached out to john to</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.760" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">kind of pursue some more concrete</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.519" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">engagement and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">lightly start to challenge him and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:12.560" style="s2">uh you know i requested him to help me</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">too to sort of unpack a lot of my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.560" end="00:03:16.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">i do a lot more writing than speaking</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">with a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">have a a dialogue with people</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">is uh is a practice to explore that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:30.959" style="s2">so that that&#39;s what brought me here too</p>

<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:58.239" style="s2">but uh so so no it&#39;s interesting what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.159" end="00:04:00.080" style="s2">what what you just seemed to say was</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.239" end="00:04:01.840" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.080" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re critic you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.840" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">with john uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">sort of coming across from a more</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:10.319" style="s2">critical perspective are there</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.360" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">areas of what areas of john&#39;s work do</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.319" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">you are you critical of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">um there like to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:21.199" style="s2">very very little in the specific content</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">of his work</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.199" end="00:04:27.759" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s partly that i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">share with him kind of a meta critique</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.759" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">in these conversation spaces right so</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">john has</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:37.600" style="s2">done a lot of that with game b people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:40.639" style="s2">with the rebel wisdom community</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.600" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">and those communities have excluded me</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.639" end="00:04:44.320" style="s2">and i think they are they&#39;re far from</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:46.240" style="s2">perfect right</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.320" end="00:04:47.680" style="s2">they&#39;re they need critical perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">and even if they say that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.680" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">entertain them uh you know quite often</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:55.600" style="s2">talking out of the side of their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">and if i did have a critique of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.600" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">verveiki&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">it would you know it would take me a</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">while to formulate obviously i&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:04.479" style="s2">consume all his 50 videos and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">be versed in the literature that he is</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.479" end="00:05:09.440" style="s2">and just be very serious about it</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">but my general critique that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.440" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">you know i agreed to i agreed with john</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:17.680" style="s2">not to have those conversations on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">record</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.680" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">but i&#39;m critical of a lot of people for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:24.320" style="s2">politics for political reasons and for</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">political discourse so</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to elicit and manifest</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">more mature conversations about politics</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:32.960" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">some of these adjacent spaces like game</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.960" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">b like integral like the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">um the emerge network which i&#39;m a part</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.240" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">they eschew taking strong political</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">uh for one reason or another and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.600" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a very tricky thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">but i&#39;m trying to uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:56.400" style="s2">foster those conversations so those are</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:56.800" style="s2">some deeper conversations that i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.400" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.800" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">have with john the second conversation</p>

<p begin="00:06:04.639" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">closed on</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:09.919" style="s2">in our first conversation which was</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.919" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">you know we both have an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">that topic</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">so that&#39;s that was our jumping off point</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:21.120" style="s2">in the second interview which we</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.960" style="s2">recorded which hasn&#39;t been posted yet</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.960" end="00:06:30.560" style="s2">grain</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:33.759" style="s2">and you&#39;re attracted to radical politics</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.560" end="00:06:35.600" style="s2">what kind of radical politics do are you</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.759" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.600" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">sure i mean it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">it&#39;s very becoming more normalized and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">these days because if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">movements of socialism for example</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:53.120" style="s2">especially in the united states has been</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">very marginalized throughout its history</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.120" end="00:06:56.400" style="s2">like europe despite what it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">through has been able to have more</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.400" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">mature conversations about socialism and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">about the welfare state and healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">and things like this the united states</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">has not because for a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.360" style="s2">variety of reasons but it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">a failed state</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.360" end="00:07:10.639" style="s2">and issuing politics is not the way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:13.039" style="s2">solve that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.639" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">my radical politics is very basic very</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.039" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">universal very unobjectional you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">environmentalism taking care of people</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:20.199" style="s2">through universal healthcare and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:23.599" style="s2">education</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.199" end="00:07:25.680" style="s2">demilitarization ending the war on drugs</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.599" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">no green new deal things like this i</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.680" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">think are pretty non-controversial</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">but pretty much everything gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">politicized</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">in in public discourse in media of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">course and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">no secret everybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">oh you know remotely attuned</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.880" end="00:07:45.919" style="s2">is aware of that nevertheless people</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:47.120" style="s2">still you know kind of follow their</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.919" end="00:07:48.879" style="s2">tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.120" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">argue aggressively for different</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.879" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">contrarian points of view</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:57.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m trying to just</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">help normalize and establish a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.120" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:04.240" style="s2">say democratic socialism and</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">so it&#39;s a long-term radicalism you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.240" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">i don&#39;t i don&#39;t uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:10.840" style="s2">don&#39;t endorse eco-terrorism or anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.840" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">violence but as a sociologist we have to</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:17.759" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">violence and social movements</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.759" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">through serious lenses you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.280" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">write off different things and we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">to take speech acts</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">and uh you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">political politicization of things as</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:35.039" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">act of violence in a way like white</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.039" end="00:08:40.959" style="s2">white-collar crime</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">is much less prosecuted and much less</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.959" end="00:08:44.560" style="s2">direct in its visible impacts it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.560" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">ubiquitous thing and it&#39;s very harmful</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:50.080" style="s2">it has</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:51.360" style="s2">it has ripple effects and consequences</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.080" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">that do</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.360" end="00:08:56.680" style="s2">cause violence it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s entangled</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:08:59.680" style="s2">with things like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.680" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">military-industrial complex so we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.680" end="00:09:03.040" style="s2">to be serious about how</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">we think critically about where violence</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.040" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">originates from</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">and and how we actually reduce it you</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:11.120" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">thinking about comparisons between</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.120" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">riders for example in a a police state</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">it uses authorized lethal force against</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:19.680" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.760" end="00:09:23.360" style="s2">often with very little discretion and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">think you know the bernie sanders</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.360" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.040" style="s2">two years in a row it&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">straightforward very populist</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.040" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">great grassroots detracted</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">huge bases of people and if it weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">for the obstruction</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">of establishment forces you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">media conglomerates and and different</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">intellectual spaces</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">everywhere from the new york times to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">these little</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">niche you know innovation spaces</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:10:00.160" style="s2">they obstructed that that mass movement</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">and without good reasons then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.160" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">contributing to this</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.720" style="s2">sort of crisis not just the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">crisis but the actual</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.720" end="00:10:10.399" style="s2">tangible material crisis uh that we face</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.440" style="s2">as a as a planet</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.399" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">oh so you know given my background</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.440" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">to foreground politics and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">encountered a lot of resistance and a</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">lot of suppression</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:25.839" style="s2">just trying to to get basic points</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">across and of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.839" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s well documented like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:32.880" style="s2">phenomenon of the bernie blackout for</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.880" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">again i say if it weren&#39;t for those</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">kinds of forces and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:44.320" style="s2">the like</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">lack of lack of like broader convergence</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.320" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">towards those ends um i i think we&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">on the right track historically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.959" style="s2">you know now we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">um a very nihilistic situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.959" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">where the american voters have to choose</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">between joe biden and donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">and so my critique to john you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">privately mostly and</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">and sort of to everyone publicly is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">if you didn&#39;t speak up you helped enable</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">this i i lost count of the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:16.959" style="s2">people whether they&#39;re just trolls or</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">very so-called serious thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.959" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">who laugh at the idea that this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">fascism</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">serious political science view and in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:28.480" style="s2">sociological and historical view</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">is that that what trump represents what</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.480" end="00:11:31.839" style="s2">the republican party represents and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">aspects of the democratic</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.839" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">democratic party represent are aspects</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">of neo-fascism</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:41.600" style="s2">and neo-feudalism so</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.680" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">i i&#39;m pushing a serious conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.600" end="00:11:44.399" style="s2">about that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">when i meet someone like john i have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.399" end="00:11:49.680" style="s2">start with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">of closer convergence like metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.680" end="00:11:56.399" style="s2">the meeting crisis metanoia and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:58.320" style="s2">metamodernism broadly and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.399" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">uh through that continued engagement we</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.320" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:08.240" style="s2">shape each other&#39;s understanding um</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:10.399" style="s2">and uh yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s where i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">view as well</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">that that for example this movement here</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">you know that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">sort of in here the awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">meeting crisis shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">necessarily actively political that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">being said</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:04.839" style="s2">where i&#39;m very with you it is</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">that we should be able to have these</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.839" end="00:13:08.240" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">with one another in a respectful manner</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.240" end="00:13:11.680" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:12.800" style="s2">far leftists and far rightists and</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.680" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">everybody in between</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.800" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">should be able to talk to one another</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">and you know to have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">like a dialogue style approach to having</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">these conversations without</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:26.320" style="s2">calling each other evil without thinking</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">of each other as evil i mean most of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.320" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">you know it&#39;s i think it&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">wanting to do good seeking good but</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.480" style="s2">having widely divergent ways of getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:37.519" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.480" end="00:13:39.519" style="s2">and seeing you know we have our natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.519" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">tribal biases that lead us to see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.519" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">as as as evil as as</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">nefarious and up up to no good so so</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">i i think that we should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">finding venues and to have the you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.760" end="00:13:59.600" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:02.800" style="s2">you know somber you know polite</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.600" end="00:14:05.199" style="s2">civil discourse between these widely</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.800" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">uh divergent views and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.199" end="00:14:07.760" style="s2">might lead us to better understand one</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.320" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.760" end="00:14:11.279" style="s2">and see each other less as nefarious and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.320" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.279" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">we can then find the areas that we agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">with one another</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">and and focus there</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.959" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">so yeah okay so yes go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:30.079" style="s2">well i wasn&#39;t sure if you were done you</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:34.639" style="s2">want me to riff refund that or</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.079" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">sure yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.639" end="00:14:37.760" style="s2">i&#39;m all for it um</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">one of the things i you know i looked up</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:44.560" style="s2">the video</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">uh with me and john on youtube just to</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.560" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">i didn&#39;t watch it but i was like just</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">checking out what was there when it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">posted</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">and i noticed the title he went with it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">was like meta modernism in the idw</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t remember talking too much about</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.880" style="s2">maybe we touched on it but it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">something that i foreground in my work</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.880" end="00:15:03.920" style="s2">and the you know the the premise and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:06.079" style="s2">pretense</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.920" end="00:15:07.519" style="s2">of the intellectual dark web is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.079" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">they were doing exactly that that they</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.519" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">were having difficult</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.880" style="s2">civil conversations and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:16.320" style="s2">actually breaking ground in some</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.880" end="00:15:18.399" style="s2">regard i understand this movement very</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.320" end="00:15:18.800" style="s2">well because i understand where it came</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.399" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.800" end="00:15:24.560" style="s2">you know i was sort of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:27.680" style="s2">emergence of new atheism in the late</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.560" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">2010s and i i completely understand that</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.680" end="00:15:31.199" style="s2">that that uh western civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.199" end="00:15:37.279" style="s2">rationality and reason-based</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">movement and i understand what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.279" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">evolved into and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:42.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve become more politically</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">literate and savvy as</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.240" end="00:15:46.240" style="s2">as time has gone on too so i feel like i</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">grew out of that before the</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.240" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">intellectual dark web emerged</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:55.279" style="s2">and oh i&#39;ve done i&#39;ve tracked it i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">done the research</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.279" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve tried to participate in some of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">those discourses</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">and it seems to me very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:07.839" style="s2">antithetical to its</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:10.240" style="s2">stated you know values and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.839" end="00:16:11.680" style="s2">you know and a number of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.240" end="00:16:13.040" style="s2">immediately come to mind and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.680" end="00:16:16.399" style="s2">as well as some of the more peripheral</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.040" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">ones but um</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.399" end="00:16:20.079" style="s2">you know it does not meet my criteria</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">for serious</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.079" end="00:16:23.839" style="s2">intellectual discussion and much less</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.839" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">political commentary and and though they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">try to be kind of de-politicized</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">it&#39;s very political and</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">so that&#39;s a major point of frustration</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:41.920" style="s2">or me and for many people</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">just to just to see that movement uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.920" end="00:16:46.959" style="s2">thrive and then kind of mutate and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">you know where we are today the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.959" end="00:16:51.759" style="s2">intellectual dark web doesn&#39;t exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:54.959" style="s2">exist in its previous form it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.759" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">fragmented and and changed but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.959" end="00:17:00.160" style="s2">still very problematic in my opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">i&#39;m still seeking to demonstrate what a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.160" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">what a real</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">civil productive conversation looks like</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:07.439" style="s2">and the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:08.160" style="s2">i think the key is to be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.439" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">valid</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.160" end="00:17:13.039" style="s2">criticism take real critique into or to</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">critique yourself</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.039" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">anticipate and to process that and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">you&#39;re not one of these</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">you know kind of just like blowhard</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">pundits or even if you&#39;re even if</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:26.959" style="s2">they&#39;re very soft-spoken</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">you know they&#39;re just very opinionated</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.959" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re very self-centered</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">and that that is not actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">uh breaking ground in any way if you if</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">you follow my logic</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:40.880" style="s2">and so just very briefly case in point</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">is the weinstein brothers and what</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.880" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">they&#39;re doing with the kind of unity</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:44.799" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">and who they talk to and who they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.799" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">talk to and how they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">the people that they don&#39;t talk to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">extremely hypocritical</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s an exhausting kind of side</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">project for me to kind of keep up with</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">the criticism of them</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:00.000" style="s2">to you know deploy my own criticism</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">occasionally</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.000" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s been it&#39;s been very fruitless</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:09.520" style="s2">regardless of the approach and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:12.080" style="s2">um you know i i hope i can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.520" end="00:18:12.880" style="s2">win that little culture skirmish in one</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.080" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">way or another</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.880" end="00:18:16.240" style="s2">uh pretty soon because it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">nowhere fast</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.240" end="00:18:22.640" style="s2">so what do you think is needed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">you know what i often see</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.640" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">gets in the way of sides getting</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">together is our internal bias our tribal</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">and and this is unconscious you know we</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">we when we see of them we have this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">instinctive sense of distrust this</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">cognitive dissonance this</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.919" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">and and that can really get in the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:41.520" style="s2">and my thought is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.760" end="00:18:43.360" style="s2">to to really open people up we have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.520" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">sort of control for our biases we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.080" style="s2">get past our biases or around our biases</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:50.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.080" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">to to open people up you know just</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.240" end="00:18:54.640" style="s2">saying i&#39;m open-minded isn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.080" style="s2">isn&#39;t really enough what do you think is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.640" end="00:18:58.160" style="s2">needed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.080" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">open up these conversations to let these</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.160" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">people with widely divergent views get</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.120" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">their their instinctive just taste of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.120" end="00:19:10.480" style="s2">the other to have a civil discussion</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s tricky but it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.480" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">the first thing that comes to mind is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">mediation</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:17.679" style="s2">you know get way more mediation and not</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:21.120" style="s2">just any mediation we need much</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.679" end="00:19:21.840" style="s2">much better protocols for mediation you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.120" end="00:19:23.919" style="s2">know the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.840" end="00:19:25.280" style="s2">the times i&#39;ve seen it done it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.919" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">disappointing</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.280" end="00:19:32.640" style="s2">and that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">another is just a shift in attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.640" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">you know and so this idea of auto</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.520" style="s2">critique</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">being able to you know spend spend much</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.520" end="00:19:43.520" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">you know research and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.520" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">deconstructing your own assumptions you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">know that that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">the process or the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">post-modernism writ large</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">which the intellectual dark web tried to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">debunk or steer around</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.480" end="00:20:07.200" style="s2">and you know regardless of how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.440" end="00:20:09.120" style="s2">phrased and by who it&#39;s largely an</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.200" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">anti-academic movement and of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.120" end="00:20:14.000" style="s2">academia has its own</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:16.320" style="s2">problems but not for lack of</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.000" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">good you know like good research by</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.320" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">humanity scholars</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">as like noam chomsky says it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:22.799" style="s2">problem is actually the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:24.000" style="s2">universities are not controlled by</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.799" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">left-wingers they&#39;re controlled by</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.000" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">right-wingers by</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">right-wing ideology and they&#39;ve and in</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:31.120" style="s2">fact they are but it&#39;s subtle</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">because universities have become very</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.120" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">corporatist and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:39.120" style="s2">pulled into financial structures into</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">neoliberal austerity and and things like</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.120" end="00:20:45.120" style="s2">this so</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:47.840" style="s2">so you know people who claim to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.120" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">claim the mantle of public intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.840" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">to to perceive what i&#39;m saying be and a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">lot&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">written about it you know so to</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:59.679" style="s2">to enter into academic debates seriously</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:03.280" style="s2">one has to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.679" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">already literate and engaged</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.280" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">and you know the the zizek versus</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">peterson debate for example</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">um whatever one may interpret from it</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:18.400" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">is that peterson is not read into</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.400" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">marxist literature which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:24.799" style="s2">cornerstone</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:27.440" style="s2">of sociology there&#39;s no there&#39;s no two</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:30.480" style="s2">ways about it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.440" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">and so and that&#39;s kind of an admission</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">on his part it&#39;s it kind of turned the</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">tide in public opinion about him</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">but um it also you know sort of helped</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">uh continue to complete his transition</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">to the to</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">the right wing completely</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:49.600" style="s2">so you know this is this is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">damage that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.600" end="00:21:55.679" style="s2">undone intellectually and and john is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">uh someone who you know worked</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:22:00.400" style="s2">very close to peterson and has his own</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:02.720" style="s2">critiques of peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.400" end="00:22:04.159" style="s2">and so it&#39;s good that he does and he can</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.720" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">approach it in his own</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.159" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">way and i&#39;ll choose choose how he frames</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:12.799" style="s2">it and how he deals with peterson</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:15.840" style="s2">personally i don&#39;t have that uh sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.799" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">luxury right and so but i respect the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.840" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">fact that he has a critique i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.240" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:24.480" style="s2">it&#39;s important for us to sort of stand</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:27.919" style="s2">up to each other and confront each other</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.480" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">of course you know john finds out like</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.919" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">many people</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">that peterson doesn&#39;t take critique</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">while it doesn&#39;t uh it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:36.640" style="s2">fruitful and it puts us in kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.840" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">paradox</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.640" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">and so that that returns to your</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">question you know how</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.760" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">how do we actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">and um you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">just reaching across the aisle and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:51.760" style="s2">having conversations with different</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:54.880" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.760" end="00:22:56.720" style="s2">isn&#39;t enough in itself all the time</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.880" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">you know it as i said at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.720" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">with having a mediator</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">it needs to be purposefully structured</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">to be good faith</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">right like i watched an interview once</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">of uh ezra klein and ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:11.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s garbage it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:15.039" style="s2">productive</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.600" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have any uh conversion</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.039" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">ratio it doesn&#39;t have any impact except</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:21.039" style="s2">to you know get some clicks and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:22.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s very disappointing in that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.039" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">regard and and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.720" end="00:23:26.799" style="s2">watching it that there is no mediation</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:29.919" style="s2">of course neither of them are properly</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.799" end="00:23:32.320" style="s2">briefed in any sort of common ground</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.919" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s just a wasted opportunity so</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.960" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:39.120" style="s2">talk to ben shapiro but stop</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.960" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">wasting opportunities and that that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.120" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">critique of everybody you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">box is kind of part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">you know the the the the left-leaning</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.279" style="s2">center if you will</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s i think it it has some</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.279" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">value and some reach</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">but is uh also</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:02.480" style="s2">kind of kind of confused about</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">the broader reality of someone like a</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.480" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:11.360" style="s2">right and if you look at the the lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">list of left critiques of ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.360" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re cutting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">ruthless they&#39;re funny</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:25.039" style="s2">and including you know debates</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.000" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">with people on the far right and a lot</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">different different happenings in</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">relevant and if we could</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:45.440" style="s2">you know build consensus sooner and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.440" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">oh people masses of people</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:52.400" style="s2">it would would um be saved the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">going down</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.400" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">endless rabbit holes and and you know</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">a lot of this could have been avoided if</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.400" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">a more inclusive space was created in</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">like proper leftists right from</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.520" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">you know to young socialists like owen</p>

<p begin="00:25:24.480" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t heard because people associate</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.279" end="00:25:36.320" style="s2">right and you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">smart people wouldn&#39;t pursue these</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.320" end="00:25:41.600" style="s2">policies if there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.400" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">a legitimate critical foundation to them</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.600" end="00:25:48.880" style="s2">and public support for them</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">so part of my background is in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.880" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">sociology of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">and so what i&#39;d like to do and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">difficult to do this is kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:58.240" style="s2">mapping out</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">the the contours of different discourses</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.240" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">demonstrate how knowledge is is created</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">and produced and disseminated and</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">how it&#39;s internalized with us</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:12.559" style="s2">so we can have a better epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:13.520" style="s2">better ways ways of knowing better ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.559" end="00:26:16.559" style="s2">of trusting</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.520" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">the right sources of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.559" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">uh so we can be more confident in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">gaining political power and asserting</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">universal policies</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:27.279" style="s2">through uh left-wing politics like as</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">you said you&#39;re we&#39;re both canadian so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.279" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">like the ndp</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">for example so you know that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">that that has to be had i try to have</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.919" style="s2">those conversations with my</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">family it&#39;s very difficult to try to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.919" end="00:26:43.600" style="s2">have them online</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">very difficult and i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.600" end="00:26:48.960" style="s2">particularly</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">enjoy being political um it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.960" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">it it comes from my sociology</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:56.720" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a whole another level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">conversation that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.720" end="00:27:02.080" style="s2">typically being had and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">so you know through my work i&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.080" end="00:27:06.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:08.799" style="s2">a lot of different sources together</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.000" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">and and uh engage with somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.799" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">john to kind of prevent</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">uh present uh such such a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">and alternative and keep moving us</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">let just one more point on that whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">kind of rant</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:24.480" style="s2">oh donald trump says in the debate last</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">night that like critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.480" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">race theory is racist this is a trope</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">that people like jordan peterson have</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">been thrown around for several years and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">so it&#39;s in the mainstream consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">and it&#39;s essentially trumpian in its</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">but a lot of smart people have come to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">believe this</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.039" style="s2">and i i insist it&#39;s kind of a brain worm</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:47.440" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.039" end="00:27:48.399" style="s2">none of those people can define critical</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.440" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">race theory</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.399" end="00:27:52.159" style="s2">adequately i i challenge any of them to</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:54.399" style="s2">do it it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.159" end="00:27:56.159" style="s2">that idea just like modernism and</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.399" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">post-modernism these ideas are quite</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.159" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">irreducible</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">i have a lot of depth and complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.080" style="s2">the academic literature</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">and we can&#39;t just throw them around in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.080" end="00:28:07.760" style="s2">completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:09.760" style="s2">orwellian sense like saying critical</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.760" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">race theory itself is racist when</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.760" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:17.440" style="s2">systemic racist problems in the united</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">states and globally so</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.440" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">this should be obvious but it&#39;s but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:22.640" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:24.960" style="s2">there are a lot of threads we could pick</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.640" end="00:28:27.039" style="s2">up there we have a couple questions uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.960" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">from from from our members so christian</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.039" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">d</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">uh says brent what do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">fixing the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:36.480" style="s2">because not everyone sees the conception</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">of progressive left that you are</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.480" end="00:28:39.039" style="s2">embodying</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">good question um</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">uh that&#39;s a good question there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">questions there one is what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">the information ecology and the other is</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">what do we do about</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">the kind of definition of progressive</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">are they&#39;re both good questions so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">you know i i i try to you know clean my</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:11.760" style="s2">information ecology and i try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">i try to promote that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.760" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">idea for you know for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:21.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a very real issue think of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:23.200" style="s2">best to think of it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.039" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">diet right like intellectual diet what</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">kind of books do you consume</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">right being in a community like</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.000" end="00:29:47.679" style="s2">breath of understanding but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">very difficult to interpret that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.679" end="00:29:51.279" style="s2">philosophy politically sometimes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:54.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.279" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">to parse political information</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.640" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">at all in general i&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:02.320" style="s2">cynical and skeptical about politics for</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">most of my life</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.320" end="00:30:06.960" style="s2">until a i studied it formally and</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">started to understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.960" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">how things work both you know both in</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">and the mechanisms of governance</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">oh [ __ ] where is it going</p>

<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">you know i i politics is is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:42.240" style="s2">difficult and so oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">what i was going to say was basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.240" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">you know i was cynical and skeptical</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">you know through through the clinton</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">years through the bush years through the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">obama years</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">um because that&#39;s just that that was my</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">innate perspective you know i loved</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.600" style="s2">comedy i loved</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">criticism you know but like you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.600" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">just like george carlin or like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:03.039" style="s2">musician like frank zappa who&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.440" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">political like these are radical</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.039" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">thinkers not just artists and and many</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:13.039" style="s2">actual philosophers and stuff you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">and so it wasn&#39;t until</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.039" end="00:31:17.519" style="s2">somebody like bernie sanders reached a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:20.399" style="s2">national level profile</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.519" end="00:31:22.480" style="s2">and i found a movement to properly</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.399" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">believe in</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.480" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">because there&#39;s so many you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:28.399" style="s2">characters in politics especially if</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.399" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">macro level you know trying to know who</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">all the heads of state are and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:35.840" style="s2">know at the local level</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">the different political and demographic</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.840" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">dynamics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also it&#39;s almost impossible to keep</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">up with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">so you have to know what commentators to</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">trust in different spaces</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">and you have to know what politicians to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">trust right</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:54.240" style="s2">and so it&#39;s typically the ones with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">smaller profile</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">who who are more genuine more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">career progressives take like ralph</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">nader</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">for example you know who who is like</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:06.399" style="s2">blamed for the 2000 election but of</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">course it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.399" end="00:32:10.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not his fault if you look at ralph</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">nader&#39;s career</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.000" end="00:32:14.399" style="s2">oh he deserves a nobel peace prize more</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.960" style="s2">than obama does</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.399" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">for if we&#39;re serious he doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.960" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">same profile the same reach look at mike</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">gravel</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">proper progressive right somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">joe biden if you look at his career</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:34.559" style="s2">it&#39;s being a centrist democrat</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">though those are just the facts and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.559" end="00:32:38.399" style="s2">politics aside</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">one of the thing most of us increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.399" end="00:32:42.159" style="s2">agree upon</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:42.559" style="s2">in these kind of meta spaces is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.159" end="00:32:45.760" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">at least 50 years you know and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.200" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">part of the awakening to the meaning</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">this narrative which is a poor it has a</p>

<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:18.320" style="s2">that that most people layman</p>

<p begin="00:33:29.440" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">so information ecology you know we have</p>

<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">and progressive left we have to do a bit</p>

<p begin="00:34:41.599" end="00:34:48.879" style="s2">you know part of the awakening</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s become excruciatingly clear</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.680" end="00:35:03.680" style="s2">in the past sort of decade</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:09.760" style="s2">process of denial and suppression works</p>

<p begin="00:36:58.240" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">of it with with moral convictions</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:06.079" style="s2">and intellectual clarity</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">and and it should be grounded in in in</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.079" end="00:37:09.119" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:10.320" style="s2">concrete it can&#39;t just be the process</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.119" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">has to be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.320" end="00:37:15.440" style="s2">in a source you know we have to know how</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:18.640" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.839" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">if we can&#39;t trust ourselves we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.599" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">know who who else to trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">and unfortunately so many people</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">you know you know they place their trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.640" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:38.960" style="s2">in the wrong person or just somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.640" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">as a placeholder because we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.960" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">and and so for me you know being</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.079" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">self-critical and self-auditing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">it&#39;s not just contemplating that process</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">and doing it in reflection that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">part of it but</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">study you know what what i was trained</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:02.160" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">and what what i what i did in my</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.160" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">self-direct</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">directed studies through university you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">know i pick</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">some of the most complex unanswered</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">questions of power knowledge and secrecy</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">these things are on one hand very</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:23.440" style="s2">well researched um on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">very like diluted with different</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.440" end="00:38:29.280" style="s2">conspiracy narratives</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">so i approached conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.280" end="00:38:32.400" style="s2">sort of as an academic that studies the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.400" end="00:38:37.440" style="s2">that allowed me to kind of reshape my</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">own understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:44.480" style="s2">of power relations and complex events</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">um but then i studied</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.480" end="00:38:50.079" style="s2">uh kind of several layers deeper of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">approach to that to that topic</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.079" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">right so like like sort of world history</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">is is very important in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">and there&#39;s a sense in which we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">trapped in systems of control in</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">buckets of ignorance uh you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:11.200" style="s2">conspiracy spectrum goes from very wacky</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.720" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.200" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">provably false ideas two</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.720" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">um very</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">well-known historical sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">conspiracies whether they&#39;re corporate</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">conspiracies or</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">political ones they they certainly exist</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.640" style="s2">and they and they</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">they&#39;ve had major turning points in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.640" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">world history</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">so things like jfk and 911 are perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:39.520" style="s2">unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.200" style="s2">but things like the gulf of tonkin</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.520" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">incident or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.200" end="00:39:46.560" style="s2">reichstag fire are well are proven</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">at this point their their public</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.560" end="00:39:51.839" style="s2">knowledge that they were</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:55.359" style="s2">sort of practical conspiracies and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.839" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">my higher level analysis is about</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.359" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">how even beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">you know we&#39;re all we&#39;re all kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">sort of you know pawns in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:12.800" style="s2">evolutionary conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">um which uh there&#39;s a source for that um</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.800" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">from a biologist and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">you know i&#39;m sort of grounding these</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">academic insights</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">in um interdisciplinary sources</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">and these are some of the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">questions of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">so to speak so it always comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">you know and is relevant to to you guys</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:33.760" style="s2">because we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">searching for answers but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.760" end="00:40:37.599" style="s2">there&#39;s at the end of the day there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">very very simple and basic sociological</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.599" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">reasons</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:41.599" style="s2">that were also ignorant even the smart</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:43.920" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.599" end="00:40:44.880" style="s2">you know we we kind of and this is this</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.920" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">explains</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.880" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">trump&#39;s rise to power you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">sufficient to blame</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:56.720" style="s2">white nationalists but to also blame</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:59.359" style="s2">the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.720" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">um kind of compliance of the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.359" end="00:41:05.040" style="s2">establishment</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:06.800" style="s2">in in enabling that and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.040" end="00:41:08.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important for us all to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.800" end="00:41:11.119" style="s2">admit</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.240" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">and to have sort of guilt and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.119" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">atonement and a sort of metanoia</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">moment to recognize that we&#39;ve all made</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:20.000" style="s2">mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">we&#39;ve all had ideological moments we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.000" end="00:41:23.680" style="s2">all grown up from</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.839" style="s2">child a childhood of magical thinking</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.680" end="00:41:28.960" style="s2">and and being lied to by different</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.839" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">adults and so this is something this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.960" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">unfinished</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">still there&#39;s there&#39;s not just a culture</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">war between right and left there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">culture war between boomers and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">millennials</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">and so these are unresolved and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">it just takes people to commit to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">resolving it</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">to to begin the process like you know if</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:49.760" style="s2">we show up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:52.880" style="s2">they show up it can happen i</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.760" end="00:41:55.760" style="s2">spoke with a i</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.880" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">on sunday who identifies as as meta</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.760" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:02.480" style="s2">this is something i don&#39;t support at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:04.560" style="s2">i&#39;m willing because it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.480" end="00:42:06.720" style="s2">kind of race-based</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.560" end="00:42:07.920" style="s2">but but i but i&#39;m willing to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.720" end="00:42:09.520" style="s2">them you know they&#39;re they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.920" end="00:42:10.319" style="s2">to stop from appropriating different</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.520" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">discourses</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.319" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">and i&#39;m willing to open up and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">and have a have a candid vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">and and also be clear about the terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">you know we we have to defer authority</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:26.880" style="s2">to different people when we don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:30.079" style="s2">understand things</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.880" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">so this person thought he</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.079" end="00:42:33.599" style="s2">you know had a had a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">philosophy of history and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.599" end="00:42:37.359" style="s2">a pretty good grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:43.680" style="s2">certain ideas and you certainly</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">good intentions and reading some left</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.680" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">sources</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">but but you know he he&#39;s all you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">he had no degrees and that in itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:54.960" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t rule out somebody being</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:58.720" style="s2">correct</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.960" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">it means he doesn&#39;t respect</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.720" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">um you know academics who</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">devote their lives to that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:06.079" style="s2">and so with the internet we&#39;re all kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.079" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">armchair researchers and pundits</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:14.240" style="s2">all of us who who do this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m not interested</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.240" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">in like a hierarchy in that regard</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">you know i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m in the trenches</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:24.160" style="s2">with everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">but uh if we really believe that there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.319" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">ethno-nationalist narratives are just</p>

<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:40.640" style="s2">with kind of a</p>

<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:50.640" style="s2">one of my areas of research which i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:52.319" style="s2">neglected because it needs more</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.640" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">resources to actually execute something</p>

<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">and there&#39;s just not a lot of kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:03.119" style="s2">access to sociologists you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">things like think tanks and news</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:08.240" style="s2">organizations are supposed to mediate</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">and a lot of you know podcasts and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.240" end="00:44:12.079" style="s2">fill that gap and try to educate the</p>

<p begin="00:44:12.079" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">but um you know think tanks which you</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.319" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">think are a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:29.920" style="s2">everything has to be audited</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.880" end="00:44:34.000" style="s2">and the kind of broad</p>

<p begin="00:44:39.200" end="00:44:44.400" style="s2">education is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">and one of one of the things i try to</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.400" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">frame this struggle in often is like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:48.800" style="s2">20th century was largely about</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.800" end="00:44:52.160" style="s2">making psychology public giving people</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.160" end="00:44:55.920" style="s2">the whole self-help industry et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.920" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">now the 21st century demands</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">that we have a sociological imagination</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:06.880" style="s2">and we&#39;re we&#39;re definitively in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">post-truth environment right where</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.880" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">conglom conglomerates constrict the flow</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">of information through the media</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">as do think tanks and people</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">ordinary people and pundits alike are</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">trafficking in a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">so um you know i&#39;m entering the fray and</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">uh also practicing the the</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">methods with you guys to try to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">some of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">you know i i just noticed that you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.319" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">some of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:42.880" style="s2">those we have people on this forum uh of</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">all different political stripes again we</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.880" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">don&#39;t talk too much about politics here</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:49.040" style="s2">we have people who are more right people</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:50.400" style="s2">are more left people who like trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.040" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">people who don&#39;t like trump</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.400" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">um but so so i notice for example</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">in your discourse here you know you</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to like a lot of the people</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:02.480" style="s2">on the right</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">uh and you use language that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.480" end="00:46:07.520" style="s2">clear do you think that using</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">more so to speak diplomatic language can</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.520" end="00:46:12.079" style="s2">make people more</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:14.880" style="s2">open to hearing your message</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.079" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">and so so i think people on each side</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.880" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">have a tendency to villainize the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:21.119" style="s2">and if we were more saw them not as</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:23.520" style="s2">villains but as</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.119" end="00:46:24.480" style="s2">people who maybe we think are misguided</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.520" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">but who</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.480" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">have different views but are probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:30.640" style="s2">seeking the good</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">it lowers that sense of distrust between</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.640" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">uh that that leads to discussions</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:36.480" style="s2">breaking down</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.560" end="00:46:42.400" style="s2">sure it depends who it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">and i i have to practice be more</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.400" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">diplomatic when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">speaking to an audience that i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:49.359" style="s2">know but i&#39;m also trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">authentic and confident in these in</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.359" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">these positions because i can defend</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">when i criticize the right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">against people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:02.240" style="s2">are known to be sort of frauds</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">or who don&#39;t engage in debate or</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.240" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">you know they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:10.880" style="s2">demonstrably</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">demagogues and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.880" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a sort of a paradox that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">someone who&#39;s on the right would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:18.160" style="s2">offended by that characterization like</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:20.240" style="s2">if i say ben</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.160" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">shapiro&#39;s full of [ __ ] and you happen to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.240" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">like ben shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:29.599" style="s2">i still want to talk to you but um</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.119" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">that person is gonna is gonna is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.599" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">wince and think that we&#39;re incompatible</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.200" style="s2">and that they that they know better than</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.200" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s limits to compassion</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:41.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying don&#39;t use it but i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:47:41.119" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">is it working because there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.960" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">different levels of forces</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:50.400" style="s2">which co-opt the whole the whole game</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:52.559" style="s2">you know i think the bernie movement by</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.400" end="00:47:55.440" style="s2">and large did everything right</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.559" end="00:47:57.359" style="s2">they weren&#39;t given a fair hearing in the</p>

<p begin="00:48:01.839" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">part of what i&#39;m trying to do is break</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.960" style="s2">that false consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.319" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">and of course i can&#39;t speak for john but</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">it seems to me like what john&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">saying is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">you know a lot of the problems we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">seeing especially around politics are</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">outgrowths or results of the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:48.640" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">and then if you listen to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.640" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">people uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">you know especially some of the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">newer uh outlets that are that are sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:56.800" style="s2">of fighting back against what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:50:00.400" style="s2">the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.800" end="00:50:02.640" style="s2">news media in the u.s uh uh so</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.400" end="00:50:04.400" style="s2">folks like uh sargon of akkad and tim</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.640" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">poole are two that sort of come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.400" end="00:50:07.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">uh sargon&#39;s in the uk and tim&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.119" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">u.s</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">um and they&#39;re sort of coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">fore right their popularity is growing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">and one of the themes that they have too</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">which is kind of weird because it goes</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">along with john&#39;s idea in some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:22.400" style="s2">politics is downstream of culture right</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.200" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.400" end="00:50:25.599" style="s2">in other words what they&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:27.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not politics that drove us here and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.599" end="00:50:29.440" style="s2">politics isn&#39;t going to drive us</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.040" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">out and so i wanted to get your take on</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.440" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">that because i&#39;m having a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:35.440" style="s2">problem from what you&#39;re saying figuring</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">out where you think the prop things need</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.440" end="00:50:38.720" style="s2">to be changed because</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">i think there&#39;s no way the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.720" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no way in hell that things can</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">be changed by politics and</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">and like you know we could go back and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">forth on whether or not that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.319" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">the establishment kept bernie sanders</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">or whatnot but that&#39;s not relevant if</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:51.359" style="s2">that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">it&#39;s unfixable and therefore you need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.359" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">start somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">and so what do you think of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:57.359" style="s2">that politics is actually downstream</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:59.040" style="s2">from culture and it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.359" end="00:50:59.599" style="s2">end of the chain it&#39;s the last thing you</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.040" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.599" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">after you know it&#39;s the last result that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:04.559" style="s2">you see and then it&#39;ll continue to sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">of catch up</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">right it&#39;s a lagging indicator uh and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">and then given that you know where</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">where do you think given that the you</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:14.160" style="s2">know if bernie sanders was a real</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">movement and he could have made it and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.160" end="00:51:17.280" style="s2">he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">then that path is cut off so given that</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.280" end="00:51:19.839" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.000" style="s2">where would you start it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.839" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">politics where else would you start to</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.000" end="00:51:28.240" style="s2">kind of change things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">um i think i missed the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.240" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying you&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">weren&#39;t endorsing</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">sargon or tim poole right you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">kind of using them as</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.359" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">examples of influential people</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:41.680" style="s2">look look i mean they&#39;re fighting back</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">against the establishment media</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.680" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">whether that&#39;s good or bad i i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">don&#39;t have a particular opinion</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">but but the interesting thing to me is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:49.359" style="s2">that they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:50.480" style="s2">fighting back against the establishment</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.359" end="00:51:52.160" style="s2">media so that gives them some</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.480" end="00:51:53.280" style="s2">credibility in my mind just establishing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.160" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">meetings</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.280" end="00:51:59.040" style="s2">okay so you&#39;re a little bit favorable</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">like you you take you take them</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.040" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">seriously</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">i mean i&#39;ll be blunt i&#39;ll be blunt it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:05.760" style="s2">not too</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.720" style="s2">i just we don&#39;t have we can unpack it</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">sometime but i</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.720" end="00:52:10.400" style="s2">you know i just want to be blunt i know</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:13.040" style="s2">that those guys are idiots</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.400" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">and trolls i know that i say that with</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.040" end="00:52:16.640" style="s2">full confidence i&#39;ve seen them</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">debate i&#39;ve seen them been taken down i</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.640" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">see the type of videos they</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:21.440" style="s2">produce yeah no sargon those guys are</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">controlled i have his t-shirt on this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.440" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">a troll</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">he&#39;s racist well i i i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">that he&#39;s a troll</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">he was always a troll</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.520" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">right so so that&#39;s not the issue the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">issue is</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:37.359" style="s2">people are seeing the same thing right</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:39.440" style="s2">which is they both state</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.359" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">in one way or another that politics is</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.440" end="00:52:43.520" style="s2">downstream of culture</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:44.800" style="s2">and and this seems to be a common theme</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.520" end="00:52:47.200" style="s2">i mean they&#39;re the two</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.800" end="00:52:49.040" style="s2">largest audience in that space you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.200" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">huge audiences yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.040" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ll answer i&#39;ll answer your your</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">question yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:57.200" style="s2">for the clarification so so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:53:00.240" style="s2">think politics is up or downstream i</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.200" end="00:53:03.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t i kind of would issue the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.240" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">the metaphor i i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.440" end="00:53:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a very complex serious question to</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">grapple with</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.280" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">politics is always happening and</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">everything&#39;s political in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">and so we can talk about these issues of</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">culture and politics</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">in tandem you know there&#39;s a reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">you you know there&#39;s degrees in culture</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">and society and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">my expertise is in in politics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">society in fact so political sociology</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">all these things are connected there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">no upstream no downstream and to frame</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.640" end="00:53:35.359" style="s2">it in those types of metaphors</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:37.839" style="s2">is to uh you know tilt the playing field</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.359" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">and to prioritize different narratives</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.839" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">and you know tim</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:42.400" style="s2">poole still claims that he&#39;s on the left</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">but you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.400" end="00:53:46.079" style="s2">certain critiques have pointed out that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">he&#39;s done like you know 17</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.079" end="00:53:52.960" style="s2">anti aoc videos in like a week</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:56.240" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s obsessive and</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.960" end="00:53:59.359" style="s2">they do have huge platforms it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.240" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge problem because</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.359" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">you know he&#39;s got confidence he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:07.280" style="s2">money he just goes online and he talks</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:10.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of this</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.280" end="00:54:14.319" style="s2">this endemic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.480" end="00:54:16.079" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s a broader problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.319" end="00:54:19.760" style="s2">than just political punditry</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.079" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">you know the whole idea of of gurus</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.760" end="00:54:26.400" style="s2">or snake oil salesmen you know going</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">back to the information ecology question</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.400" end="00:54:29.760" style="s2">they they&#39;re very bad information</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">ecologies and if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.760" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">if there was a simple answer we would do</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:34.319" style="s2">it but what i see is a kind of war of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">attrition</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.319" end="00:54:38.480" style="s2">where they just keep creating more</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">content and they&#39;re winning the click</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">funnel war over the smaller leftist</p>

<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">i think it&#39;s just personally that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.599" end="01:00:40.240" style="s2">uh this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">what i&#39;ve come up with is that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.240" end="01:00:45.119" style="s2">we have these tribal biases</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">and these these are unconscious and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.119" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">and i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:48.960" style="s2">i hear sort of similar things from the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">right where where you said</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.960" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">you know people have to be you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">ready to hear things they don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:54.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:56.079" style="s2">and i agree we should be ready that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.559" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">being said</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.079" end="01:01:00.640" style="s2">tribal biases are unconscious and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:01.599" style="s2">takes a tremendous amount of work to get</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.640" end="01:01:04.400" style="s2">to the point</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.599" end="01:01:05.760" style="s2">where we&#39;re not and i don&#39;t think we can</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.400" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">even do it entirely</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.760" end="01:01:09.599" style="s2">so where we&#39;re not influenced by our</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">tribal biases so</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.599" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">i think this is me personally this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:14.960" style="s2">not about this conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:16.960" style="s2">any conversation between people of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.960" end="01:01:19.599" style="s2">divergent views if we</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.960" end="01:01:21.200" style="s2">we have to i or if we want to not</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.599" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">trigger those tribal biases i think we</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.200" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">have to take</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">efforts not to do that um it it</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">and and i think that to me my instinct</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">is that will lead to better results</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:36.799" style="s2">uh than than just telling people to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:38.640" style="s2">to to not take offense or whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.799" end="01:01:40.000" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s just the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.640" end="01:01:43.040" style="s2">humans that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.000" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">we are emotional and and and</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.040" end="01:01:47.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s not about just choosing to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:48.880" style="s2">offended or whatnot we get offended</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.280" end="01:01:50.480" style="s2">and maybe through you know deep</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.880" end="01:01:52.559" style="s2">meditation practices</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.480" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">and or just developing a thick skin and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.559" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">i think some people</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.039" style="s2">just naturally have a thicker skin than</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:01:59.280" style="s2">others too</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.039" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">but but that if we want to open up</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.280" end="01:02:02.079" style="s2">discord my</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">my primary interest has always been</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.079" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">discourse that i almost don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:10.160" style="s2">if we come to an agreement if we leave</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">better understanding one another that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.160" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">a great conversation that&#39;s a productive</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:16.559" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:19.200" style="s2">and if we leave realizing that the other</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.559" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">are not evil that&#39;s that&#39;s even better</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.200" end="01:02:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s about living</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">and working with each other that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.680" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">always going to have people of divergent</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:25.599" style="s2">views and that&#39;s probably healthy for</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.599" end="01:02:29.359" style="s2">so how do we do this together you know i</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:31.520" style="s2">don&#39;t want my political personal</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.359" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">political party to win every time i want</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.520" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">the other party to win sometimes because</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:38.400" style="s2">no no one group</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:39.440" style="s2">has nailed the has nailed it no one</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.400" end="01:02:42.079" style="s2">group has nailed it</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.440" end="01:02:42.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s pros and cons of both sides</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.079" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.720" end="01:02:46.559" style="s2">and and that&#39;s probably very healthy for</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:47.520" style="s2">society if we ever get stuck in one</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.559" end="01:02:49.680" style="s2">track</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.520" end="01:02:51.520" style="s2">that will probably lead to bad things as</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.680" end="01:02:53.280" style="s2">well you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.520" end="01:02:55.039" style="s2">i&#39;ve always thought you know you if when</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.280" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">you aim for utopia</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:02:58.640" style="s2">the target is so small that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:00.480" style="s2">almost guaranteed to miss</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.640" end="01:03:02.160" style="s2">and when you miss the results can be</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.480" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">disastrous so</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.160" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">you know the aim isn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:08.000" style="s2">utopia it&#39;s a workable solution</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">ah um there&#39;s a good argument for this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.240" end="01:03:18.000" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">like incrementalism and of course</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.000" end="01:03:21.119" style="s2">treating people with respect you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.119" end="01:03:28.319" style="s2">and and being diplomatic and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.240" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.319" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">it&#39;s ironically again with the idw like</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">many of their spaces have been the most</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">hostile to</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">to dissent and so they they frame</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">themselves as</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">the vanguard of of something but</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s ultimately very</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:49.599" style="s2">anti-intellectual it&#39;s intellectuals</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:50.559" style="s2">being anti-intellectual and i wrote a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.599" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.559" end="01:03:57.520" style="s2">long-form article about that that is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:04:00.880" style="s2">kind of meta theory that contextualizes</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.520" end="01:04:02.319" style="s2">my other critiques knowing how difficult</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.880" end="01:04:04.079" style="s2">critique is and how</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.319" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">how difficult it is to change each</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.079" end="01:04:10.000" style="s2">other&#39;s minds or change our own minds</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">but there you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.000" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">i i respect your process</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:16.799" style="s2">but i think it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t scale</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:18.480" style="s2">fast enough</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.799" end="01:04:19.920" style="s2">right and we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.480" end="01:04:23.200" style="s2">for solutions like</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.920" end="01:04:25.680" style="s2">so when i say politics i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.200" end="01:04:27.039" style="s2">mean again that it&#39;s you know downstream</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.680" end="01:04:29.359" style="s2">or upstream from culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.039" end="01:04:30.720" style="s2">or that it&#39;s or that it&#39;s just um a</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.359" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">performance and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.720" end="01:04:34.319" style="s2">the aggregate of different competing</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">groups is interests</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.319" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">at the at critical moments it&#39;s a lever</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:41.200" style="s2">of change</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:43.440" style="s2">right so much of what has happened</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.200" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">historically</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.440" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">has including some technological</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">innovation</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:52.559" style="s2">has been dependent on on political</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">change and revolutions aren&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.559" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">bloody and so we if we look at</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:05:00.720" style="s2">history broadly it contains a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:02.559" style="s2">scope for that flexibility and i think</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.720" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">the the cultural</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.559" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">political moment we&#39;ve been kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">stuck in for the past 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">has been this one that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:13.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.240" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">incremental change but</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.280" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">the the fact is and always has been</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">that in a certain frame the so-called</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.839" end="01:05:24.480" style="s2">democracy in the us</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:25.200" style="s2">is a kind of false dilemma right that</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.480" end="01:05:28.319" style="s2">there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.200" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">two-party oligopoly and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.319" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">this is actually a way to transcend that</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:35.760" style="s2">issue but it doesn&#39;t mean the two sides</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">are equal what it means is</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.760" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">the discourse is already captured so if</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">you have a political opinion</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a good chance that you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:47.280" style="s2">and as you said even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">a progressive there&#39;s there&#39;s ways that</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.280" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">can go wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:54.000" style="s2">right and so i&#39;m i&#39;m also skeptical of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.000" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">uh different uh narratives and different</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.039" style="s2">leaders</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">when you know somebody like obama he he</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.039" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">kind of very diplomatically commands a</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:08.480" style="s2">certain</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:10.799" style="s2">faith and investment in what he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.480" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">but the the unfortunately the truth is</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.799" end="01:06:14.720" style="s2">you know he</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">was kind of a lame duck and sellout</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.720" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">president in a time when we needed</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:20.480" style="s2">him to be more radical there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">argument for how</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.839" end="01:09:38.400" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:41.279" style="s2">no manual you have a question</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.400" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">right so i was listening uh to your talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.279" end="01:09:45.759" style="s2">with viveke and</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">you brought up this concept of vicious</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.759" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:52.880" style="s2">and that is something to be avoided</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.679" end="01:09:58.159" style="s2">and although i&#39;m a little bit iffy on</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.800" style="s2">the definition of</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.159" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">of the thing i can at least see the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.800" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">that you used it in relation</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:09.199" style="s2">to peterson and i was wondering</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">how you avoid doing vicious abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.199" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">yeah thank you that&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:18.480" style="s2">and i i recall</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:20.800" style="s2">from my conversation with raviki that we</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.480" end="01:10:23.440" style="s2">we both offered a partial definition</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.800" end="01:10:25.199" style="s2">and we kind of we kind of flew by it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.440" end="01:10:29.520" style="s2">so i appreciate the chance</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.199" end="01:10:31.679" style="s2">to revisit that um</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.520" end="01:10:34.159" style="s2">i said that vicious abstraction one</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.679" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">example was misquotation</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.159" end="01:10:37.360" style="s2">that&#39;s a bit limited it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:39.760" style="s2">example but</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.360" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">vicious abstraction is also taking</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.760" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">things out of context</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">so like</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:47.920" style="s2">the idea of misquotation like if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:50.159" style="s2">take a</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:51.040" style="s2">quote of somebody from speech or from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.159" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">book</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.040" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">and use that to make a bad faith</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">critique of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:10:58.560" style="s2">and say well this is what they said you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:10:59.679" style="s2">know and then that other that person has</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.560" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">to come back and say well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.679" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">what i said you know you took it out of</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:05.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a vicious abstraction and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:07.440" style="s2">a that&#39;s a fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.679" end="01:11:09.679" style="s2">right the person who did that made a</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.440" end="01:11:12.640" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.679" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">in in misquoting and so you know as a</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.640" end="01:11:16.320" style="s2">from a scholarship point of view</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">obviously you&#39;re trained not to do that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.320" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">you&#39;re trained to</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:21.440" style="s2">take sources very seriously to to not</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:24.480" style="s2">plagiarize</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.440" end="01:11:27.280" style="s2">to think critically to</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.480" end="01:11:28.320" style="s2">um evaluate claims and to represent them</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.280" end="01:11:31.040" style="s2">authentically and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.320" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to do i think you</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.040" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">casually and unconsciously we all do</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:39.040" style="s2">vicious abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:39.600" style="s2">by be unintentionally misinterpreting</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.040" end="01:11:41.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.600" end="01:11:43.760" style="s2">and then say oh you know so-and-so said</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.280" end="01:11:47.199" style="s2">this and it so gets passed on</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.760" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">like the telephone game</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.199" end="01:11:52.719" style="s2">but we also do it in a in a conscious</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:55.040" style="s2">way i think that can be</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.719" end="01:11:56.320" style="s2">intervened on more if you&#39;re aware of it</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.040" end="01:12:00.000" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.320" end="01:12:02.000" style="s2">i think yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.000" end="01:12:03.600" style="s2">so i just want to introduce the way that</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.000" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">i think about these things right</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.600" end="01:12:07.920" style="s2">because sure we always need to relate to</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">something in a context right so whenever</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.920" end="01:12:12.560" style="s2">we&#39;re relating to a thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:14.000" style="s2">always establishing a context from which</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.560" end="01:12:15.040" style="s2">we&#39;re relating to the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.000" end="01:12:18.159" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.040" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">right and other people will necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.159" end="01:12:21.280" style="s2">disagree with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">context because we have different</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.280" end="01:12:25.280" style="s2">perspectives so</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:26.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we can avoid vicious</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.280" end="01:12:30.320" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.800" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">in in that sense and i i think that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.320" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">thing we can do is be graceful towards</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:36.480" style="s2">people when we do it and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:40.560" style="s2">adjust</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.480" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">our perspectives but um i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.560" end="01:12:43.760" style="s2">yeah like when</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">when you suppose that that can be</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.600" end="01:12:52.159" style="s2">fixed like like i&#39;m really skeptical</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:54.239" style="s2">when i hear that so i i&#39;d like to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.159" end="01:12:56.800" style="s2">sure a little bit into that like how do</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.239" end="01:13:00.320" style="s2">you perfect i appreciate the question</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.800" end="01:13:01.920" style="s2">so i was trying to give an example of</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.320" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">vicious abstraction but that&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.920" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">it is it&#39;s not just and so i can give an</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:08.560" style="s2">another example</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.120" end="01:13:09.679" style="s2">if we&#39;re trying to define concept of of</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.560" end="01:13:12.800" style="s2">a chair</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.679" end="01:13:14.080" style="s2">or a car you know or a horse like that</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.800" end="01:13:16.719" style="s2">is an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:17.440" style="s2">right we we can create an ideal form of</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.719" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">it to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.440" end="01:13:24.800" style="s2">you know a horse has short thick</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">hair it has four legs it has a um</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.800" end="01:13:31.840" style="s2">you know a a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:33.120" style="s2">like a mane and you know a long face</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.840" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a horse and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.120" end="01:13:37.600" style="s2">you know and then i would you know i say</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">it&#39;s either brown or black and then</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.600" end="01:13:41.920" style="s2">or white and then you you know you say</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.320" end="01:13:44.159" style="s2">well what about a zebra</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.920" end="01:13:46.080" style="s2">like these are there&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.159" end="01:13:47.600" style="s2">abstractions right like what are the</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.080" end="01:13:50.159" style="s2">requirements of the thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.600" end="01:13:50.719" style="s2">to qualify as the abstraction like does</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.159" end="01:13:52.400" style="s2">a chair</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.719" end="01:13:53.840" style="s2">have to have legs or can it sit on the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.400" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">floor and still be a chair like these</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.840" end="01:13:58.640" style="s2">are really banal examples</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:14:00.000" style="s2">the point i&#39;m trying to get to when we</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.640" end="01:14:02.880" style="s2">talk about</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.000" end="01:14:03.360" style="s2">higher level con you know abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.880" end="01:14:06.199" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.360" end="01:14:07.679" style="s2">liberalism democracy capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.199" end="01:14:11.600" style="s2">neoliberalism</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.679" end="01:14:14.080" style="s2">marxism these are containers</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.600" end="01:14:15.520" style="s2">which actually contain a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.080" end="01:14:18.480" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.520" end="01:14:19.600" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a concept of leaky</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.480" end="01:14:21.920" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.600" end="01:14:23.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m actually agreeing</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.920" end="01:14:26.880" style="s2">with that like</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.440" end="01:14:29.760" style="s2">why can&#39;t they be containers that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.880" end="01:14:30.400" style="s2">big ideas that don&#39;t contain small ideas</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.760" end="01:14:32.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.400" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t see it&#39;s necessary that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.320" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">they have to contain those ideas</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.800" end="01:14:40.640" style="s2">um i&#39;m not sure the critique you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.640" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">making i&#39;m not saying it like</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.640" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">like a certain definition might contain</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">a minimum</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">set of characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:55.199" style="s2">right so so a proper definition</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:58.560" style="s2">of something like marxism or fascism</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.199" end="01:15:01.520" style="s2">will have a generally agreed upon</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.560" end="01:15:02.320" style="s2">set of features to it and so let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.520" end="01:15:04.960" style="s2">them like</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.320" end="01:15:06.000" style="s2">points in or something like a bullet</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.960" end="01:15:07.920" style="s2">point so</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.000" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">does it have five features does it have</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.920" end="01:15:12.159" style="s2">10 does it have</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.840" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">i think you know we that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.159" end="01:15:17.360" style="s2">would explore but</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">but like we can agree that the word</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.360" end="01:15:21.760" style="s2">essence right like something has an</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:24.239" style="s2">essence right something is identified by</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.760" end="01:15:26.400" style="s2">its essence</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.239" end="01:15:28.640" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re talking about abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.400" end="01:15:30.400" style="s2">very high level abstractions</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.640" end="01:15:31.760" style="s2">that&#39;s irrelevant the abstraction of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.400" end="01:15:33.440" style="s2">horse</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.760" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">abstraction of a horse directly</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.440" end="01:15:38.880" style="s2">correlates to the to an actual horse</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:40.880" style="s2">the abstraction of capitalism has</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.880" end="01:15:43.600" style="s2">many layers of correlation with many</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.880" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">other ideas these are macro concepts</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.600" end="01:15:50.960" style="s2">and so my point with vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:52.000" style="s2">if if somebody mischaracterizes what</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.960" end="01:15:55.280" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.000" end="01:15:56.800" style="s2">actually is in the abstract</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.280" end="01:15:58.560" style="s2">that&#39;s a vicious abstraction and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.800" end="01:16:01.360" style="s2">called vicious because it has</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.560" end="01:16:03.280" style="s2">vicious knock-on effects and so the goal</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.360" end="01:16:05.199" style="s2">between us should be the clarity of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.280" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">of the abstractions and the good good</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.199" end="01:16:09.840" style="s2">faith transmission of those ideas</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m confused why can&#39;t there be an</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.840" end="01:16:16.320" style="s2">essence of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.280" end="01:16:18.640" style="s2">um the short answer is because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.320" end="01:16:19.040" style="s2">socially constructed and it evolves over</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.640" end="01:16:21.120" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.040" end="01:16:22.400" style="s2">capitalism is something that we made up</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.120" end="01:16:24.480" style="s2">and that we that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.400" end="01:16:26.560" style="s2">determine but that doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.480" end="01:16:28.480" style="s2">definition is totally relativists</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.560" end="01:16:29.679" style="s2">like that there&#39;s your capitalism in my</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.480" end="01:16:31.679" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:34.239" style="s2">what it is as an abstraction is</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.679" end="01:16:37.520" style="s2">something that correlates to</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.239" end="01:16:39.920" style="s2">many concrete realities</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.520" end="01:16:40.640" style="s2">right like the concept of money the the</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.920" end="01:16:43.679" style="s2">concept of</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.640" end="01:16:45.760" style="s2">of st of exchange of interest of</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.679" end="01:16:48.560" style="s2">property ownership</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.760" end="01:16:50.320" style="s2">right there&#39;s all these features and a</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.560" end="01:16:50.719" style="s2">vicious abstraction is when certain of</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:52.800" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.719" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">aspects get purposefully or or</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.800" end="01:16:57.920" style="s2">accidentally left out</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:59.120" style="s2">so let me let me try to suggest an</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.920" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">alternative for you</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.120" end="01:17:05.440" style="s2">to to relate to this right so so i</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:06.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m gonna go to platonic forms here</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.440" end="01:17:08.640" style="s2">right so we we have an</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.800" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">ascent right we have an essential</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.640" end="01:17:12.480" style="s2">structure right something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:13.440" style="s2">necessarily true for the thing to exist</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.480" end="01:17:15.760" style="s2">right and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.440" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">implementation of the essential</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.760" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">structure in reality right</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:21.199" style="s2">and those are two different things right</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:23.199" style="s2">we can distinguish between</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.199" end="01:17:24.480" style="s2">the essential structure and how we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.199" end="01:17:26.800" style="s2">using it and like</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.480" end="01:17:28.640" style="s2">i i think when you&#39;re saying well</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.800" end="01:17:30.640" style="s2">there&#39;s all of these nuances</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.640" end="01:17:32.880" style="s2">the nuances are in the use of the thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.640" end="01:17:35.199" style="s2">not in the thing itself</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.880" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">i think i think if we use language and</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.199" end="01:17:38.640" style="s2">we use definition</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:40.880" style="s2">right like the definition is pointing at</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.640" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">a thing and we can talk about the thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.880" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">without its implementation</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re talking about like the idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:51.920" style="s2">of a house behind all houses right</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:54.000" style="s2">and i i don&#39;t see what the contradiction</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.920" end="01:17:55.600" style="s2">was directly with what i was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.000" end="01:17:58.080" style="s2">say because i&#39;m trying to say there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.600" end="01:18:00.239" style="s2">idea of a horse there&#39;s an idea of a car</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:02.560" style="s2">that is behind all the instances there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.239" end="01:18:05.280" style="s2">also an idea of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.560" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">that is not contingent upon all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.280" end="01:18:08.880" style="s2">aspects that you</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:10.640" style="s2">put onto it right like you can put them</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.880" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">on later right and then we have</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.640" end="01:18:13.760" style="s2">an american implementation of capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:16.159" style="s2">when you have a european</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.760" end="01:18:17.199" style="s2">implementation of capitalism not</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.159" end="01:18:20.960" style="s2">contradictory with</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.199" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">capitalism as essential</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.960" end="01:18:24.719" style="s2">structure and then the essential</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:25.520" style="s2">structure well the point i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.719" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">make is</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.520" end="01:18:30.560" style="s2">that the essential structure thereby</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:32.719" style="s2">cannot be viciously abstracted because</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.560" end="01:18:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s essential right like</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.719" end="01:18:38.480" style="s2">there is no negative interpretation of</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.040" end="01:18:39.600" style="s2">the thing it&#39;s just defined as a thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.480" end="01:18:41.520" style="s2">right but it still hinges on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.600" end="01:18:43.520" style="s2">definition like where is it defined</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.520" end="01:18:45.920" style="s2">point to the definition that is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.520" end="01:18:48.080" style="s2">abstraction ultimately that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.920" end="01:18:49.040" style="s2">to cope with and i&#39;m saying if people</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.080" end="01:18:53.120" style="s2">misrepresent</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.040" end="01:18:54.719" style="s2">that form it&#39;s a vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.120" end="01:18:56.960" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to agree with you that</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.719" end="01:18:58.400" style="s2">somewhere out there there&#39;s an ideal of</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.960" end="01:19:01.120" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.400" end="01:19:02.400" style="s2">but the vicious misrepresent the</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.120" end="01:19:05.280" style="s2">misrepresentation</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.400" end="01:19:06.640" style="s2">of it is a vicious abstraction the only</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.280" end="01:19:09.760" style="s2">way to counter that</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.640" end="01:19:13.040" style="s2">whether in dialogue or as a personal</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.760" end="01:19:15.679" style="s2">investigation to research the definition</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.040" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">right so you know i&#39;ve i&#39;ve lost count</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.679" end="01:19:17.520" style="s2">to the number of times people tell me</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:19.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.520" end="01:19:21.600" style="s2">neoliberalism doesn&#39;t mean anything of</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.920" end="01:19:24.000" style="s2">course it means something it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.600" end="01:19:24.480" style="s2">far removed from daily discourse and</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.000" end="01:19:25.840" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.480" end="01:19:27.520" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very distorted through</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.840" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">different narratives</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.520" end="01:19:30.880" style="s2">but i would hope we can agree on that</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:33.600" style="s2">neoliberalism is a subset</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.880" end="01:19:35.280" style="s2">of capitalism it means different things</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.600" end="01:19:38.560" style="s2">to different people</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.280" end="01:19:41.280" style="s2">that that that differentiated meaning</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.560" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">is viciously distorted in different uh</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.280" end="01:19:45.120" style="s2">for different different audiences</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.040" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">i think there if there is a a true</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.120" end="01:19:50.719" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s very hard to reach</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:52.640" style="s2">because abstractions are inherently</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.719" end="01:19:53.920" style="s2">out of reach they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.640" end="01:19:56.320" style="s2">mental</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.920" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">projections that that people came up</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.320" end="01:20:01.679" style="s2">with and mediated through</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:04.719" style="s2">through the process of</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.679" end="01:20:05.760" style="s2">of you know academia and debate and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.719" end="01:20:08.400" style="s2">so we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.760" end="01:20:09.120" style="s2">grappling with um unfolding those things</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.400" end="01:20:11.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.120" end="01:20:13.280" style="s2">like the end of the cold war was a clear</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.040" end="01:20:15.920" style="s2">victory for capitalism and a</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.280" end="01:20:17.840" style="s2">failure it was certainly a failure of</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.920" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">communism but not necessarily a failure</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.840" end="01:20:20.960" style="s2">of the idea of socialism because</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.679" style="s2">inequality and</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.960" end="01:20:26.000" style="s2">and stuff has increased since then and</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.679" end="01:20:29.040" style="s2">the climate catastrophe has deepened</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.000" end="01:20:32.159" style="s2">since then so part of the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.040" end="01:20:35.840" style="s2">i think to put it in those terms</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.159" end="01:20:37.679" style="s2">is the the failure to</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.840" end="01:20:39.760" style="s2">really grok these abstractions like</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.679" end="01:20:41.600" style="s2">capitalism and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.760" end="01:20:43.520" style="s2">climate change you know so we end up</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.600" end="01:20:45.040" style="s2">having endless debates over them but</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.520" end="01:20:46.080" style="s2">people are talking past each other</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.040" end="01:20:48.159" style="s2">because they don&#39;t mean this</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.080" end="01:20:49.360" style="s2">the same thing if we had a third party</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.159" end="01:20:52.320" style="s2">mediator</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.360" end="01:20:53.920" style="s2">said hey this is what capitalism is this</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.320" end="01:20:56.960" style="s2">definition i&#39;m going to read</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.920" end="01:20:59.679" style="s2">is sort of co-developed by you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.960" end="01:21:01.840" style="s2">scholars and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.679" end="01:21:03.440" style="s2">match with a general understanding and</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.840" end="01:21:05.600" style="s2">this is what some of the stuff people</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.440" end="01:21:08.159" style="s2">typically get wrong about it</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.600" end="01:21:09.120" style="s2">you know i think i think that&#39;s key to</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.159" end="01:21:15.280" style="s2">having any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.120" end="01:21:16.800" style="s2">constructive debate so</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:18.960" style="s2">this is what i mean by vicious</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.800" end="01:21:21.840" style="s2">abstraction you know it has many</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.960" end="01:21:23.520" style="s2">meanings but the key is to understand</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.840" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">what good abstraction is in the first</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.520" end="01:21:29.520" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">well okay so um</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.520" end="01:21:32.800" style="s2">i would argue with the fact that it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:35.199" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.800" end="01:21:35.840" style="s2">like when when you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.199" end="01:21:37.920" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.840" end="01:21:39.679" style="s2">an essence right like you cannot like</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:41.280" style="s2">you need to abstract something from the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.679" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">essence or something</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.280" end="01:21:45.120" style="s2">in order for it to be an abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">if it&#39;s just a thing it&#39;s just a thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.120" end="01:21:50.000" style="s2">so i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">and and i agree with you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.000" end="01:21:53.280" style="s2">a lot of people who are using terms</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:55.199" style="s2">right like and</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.280" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re abstracting things from</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.199" end="01:21:59.679" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:22:01.840" style="s2">all the time and like i i i really</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.679" end="01:22:03.040" style="s2">really dislike it like i&#39;m i&#39;m totally</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.840" end="01:22:06.719" style="s2">on board with you on that</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.040" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">that that part so so like like</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.719" end="01:22:12.239" style="s2">i like that but the idea that that that</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:14.960" style="s2">is a problem but like</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.239" end="01:22:16.480" style="s2">yeah like i i just get the feeling when</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.960" end="01:22:17.520" style="s2">i&#39;m talking to you that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.480" end="01:22:21.520" style="s2">taking it like</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.520" end="01:22:25.040" style="s2">one step too far and like it&#39;s the issue</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.520" end="01:22:28.080" style="s2">the issue is is in in the</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.040" end="01:22:29.360" style="s2">the not being careful with speech as</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.080" end="01:22:32.239" style="s2">opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.360" end="01:22:33.040" style="s2">uh the abstractions or whatever like</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.239" end="01:22:35.520" style="s2">like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.040" end="01:22:36.960" style="s2">the abstractions are just manifestations</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.520" end="01:22:40.080" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.960" end="01:22:41.440" style="s2">not having our thoughts in order and not</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.080" end="01:22:45.600" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.440" end="01:22:48.560" style="s2">well-reasoned arguments basically</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.600" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">yeah i yeah i think we have some common</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.560" end="01:22:54.000" style="s2">ground here i think it&#39;s a very complex</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:55.040" style="s2">question though you know abstraction is</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.000" end="01:22:56.880" style="s2">kind of my</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.040" end="01:22:59.600" style="s2">wheelhouse that i&#39;ve carved out for</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.880" end="01:23:02.400" style="s2">myself and it&#39;s a big part of</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.600" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">what i&#39;m trying to demonstrate about the</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.400" end="01:23:05.360" style="s2">sociology of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:07.760" style="s2">that we all are operating with different</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.360" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">different abstractions like every word</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.760" end="01:23:12.639" style="s2">is an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:15.199" style="s2">the more abstract that word is the more</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.639" end="01:23:16.480" style="s2">uh prone it likely is to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.199" end="01:23:19.760" style="s2">misinterpretation or</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.480" end="01:23:21.040" style="s2">or distortion and so i think that at</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.760" end="01:23:24.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.040" end="01:23:27.679" style="s2">prompts a lot of confusion and and</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.320" end="01:23:29.679" style="s2">um divergences of opinions and</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.679" end="01:23:31.360" style="s2">you know to just a sort of case in point</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.679" end="01:23:33.120" style="s2">with capitalism is the way jordan</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.360" end="01:23:34.159" style="s2">peterson talks about capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.120" end="01:23:36.800" style="s2">marxism</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.159" end="01:23:39.120" style="s2">in my writings i use him as an example</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.800" end="01:23:41.360" style="s2">of committing vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.120" end="01:23:42.719" style="s2">because he&#39;s not using the terms in any</p>

<p begin="01:23:42.719" end="01:23:50.239" style="s2">is legible or compatible with</p>

<p begin="01:23:52.639" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">or or economist you know peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.679" end="01:24:00.560" style="s2">essentially taking a reductionist view</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:02.320" style="s2">right and that&#39;s what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.560" end="01:24:03.920" style="s2">vicious abstraction when you collapse</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.320" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">capitalism and say</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.920" end="01:24:08.880" style="s2">in into market fundamentalism basically</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:11.120" style="s2">the idea of market fundamentalism is you</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.880" end="01:24:13.679" style="s2">equate</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.120" end="01:24:14.400" style="s2">free markets with being the generator of</p>

<p begin="01:24:18.639" end="01:24:24.480" style="s2">having free markets is just part of the</p>

<p begin="01:24:24.480" end="01:24:29.920" style="s2">are often</p>

<p begin="01:25:24.480" end="01:25:29.520" style="s2">horse here</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.679" end="01:25:32.320" style="s2">there is from my perspective right like</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.520" end="01:25:33.440" style="s2">all all the people right like when you</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.320" end="01:25:36.639" style="s2">have an idea</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.440" end="01:25:39.840" style="s2">right you can detach</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.639" end="01:25:42.560" style="s2">the idea from a school like i feel like</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.840" end="01:25:43.840" style="s2">too many people like and and this is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.560" end="01:25:45.520" style="s2">critique i have a view with the</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.840" end="01:25:47.600" style="s2">post-modernism right like i think</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.520" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">post-modernism was a reaction to what</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.600" end="01:25:52.719" style="s2">happened in the second world war</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:54.800" style="s2">right and then there was a group</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.719" end="01:25:56.719" style="s2">of thinkers right and that group of</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.800" end="01:25:57.520" style="s2">thinkers grew and grew and grew and grew</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.719" end="01:25:59.920" style="s2">but like</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.520" end="01:26:01.840" style="s2">to put that all right like either you</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.920" end="01:26:04.400" style="s2">choose the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.840" end="01:26:06.320" style="s2">where where the thing originated as as</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.400" end="01:26:09.679" style="s2">what post-modernism is or you</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.320" end="01:26:12.400" style="s2">you choose to to whatever</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.679" end="01:26:13.520" style="s2">is now happening as as as the label post</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.400" end="01:26:16.159" style="s2">modernism but</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.520" end="01:26:18.719" style="s2">but if you use what&#39;s now as as the</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.159" end="01:26:20.480" style="s2">label like that that doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.719" end="01:26:22.000" style="s2">make sense at least from my perspective</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.480" end="01:26:23.600" style="s2">because in in a sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.000" end="01:26:25.440" style="s2">meaningless right like the meaning of</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.600" end="01:26:27.920" style="s2">post-modernism comes from its</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.440" end="01:26:28.880" style="s2">historical context right so so then i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.920" end="01:26:31.280" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.880" end="01:26:33.280" style="s2">maybe these people from my perspective</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.280" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">are not post-modern thinkers at least if</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.280" end="01:26:36.960" style="s2">their ideas are not</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:40.000" style="s2">related to the post-modern critique</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.960" end="01:26:41.840" style="s2">right and and this is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.000" end="01:26:43.120" style="s2">let me post modernism is a good example</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.840" end="01:26:46.960" style="s2">let me just pivot</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.120" end="01:26:50.159" style="s2">to the concept of a leaky abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.960" end="01:26:52.560" style="s2">um it comes from computer science but i</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.159" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">you know i think it applies to two words</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.560" end="01:26:56.000" style="s2">too like conceptually postmodernism is</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:58.800" style="s2">messy</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.000" end="01:27:00.239" style="s2">i&#39;m not like don&#39;t identify as a</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.800" end="01:27:01.760" style="s2">postmodernist or anything that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.239" end="01:27:04.880" style="s2">write about</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.760" end="01:27:06.080" style="s2">modernism as a different thing and that</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.880" end="01:27:08.239" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.080" end="01:27:09.520" style="s2">complex topic too right it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.239" end="01:27:12.880" style="s2">evolving it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.520" end="01:27:14.960" style="s2">disputed and my article was largely</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.880" end="01:27:17.760" style="s2">about that the kind of historiography</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.960" end="01:27:18.960" style="s2">of that so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complex</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.760" end="01:27:19.920" style="s2">overview of that</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.960" end="01:27:22.400" style="s2">and i have a whole section on</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.920" end="01:27:24.320" style="s2">post-modernism and the point is</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.400" end="01:27:26.560" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to reduce</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.320" end="01:27:28.000" style="s2">post-modernism to a single universal</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.560" end="01:27:30.719" style="s2">definition</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.000" end="01:27:32.719" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong it means</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.719" end="01:27:37.520" style="s2">the term itself</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.719" end="01:27:40.560" style="s2">is is a is a kind of um</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.520" end="01:27:43.120" style="s2">slippery or diaphanous container for a</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.560" end="01:27:44.719" style="s2">cert for a bunch of ideas but one of my</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.120" end="01:27:46.480" style="s2">key points is that it&#39;s irreducible and</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.719" end="01:27:47.679" style="s2">if people reduce it to say hey</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.480" end="01:27:51.760" style="s2">post-modernism is</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.679" end="01:27:54.080" style="s2">this post-modernism is relativism</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.760" end="01:27:55.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a vicious abstraction that does a</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.080" end="01:27:57.280" style="s2">disservice to</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.440" end="01:27:58.880" style="s2">ourselves as thinkers because these</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.280" end="01:28:01.760" style="s2">things are more complex i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.880" end="01:28:03.199" style="s2">i&#39;m going the opposite way i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.760" end="01:28:04.000" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there&#39;s an essence to all</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.199" end="01:28:07.120" style="s2">these words</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.000" end="01:28:09.760" style="s2">you&#39;re kind of well there needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.120" end="01:28:10.560" style="s2">well not not i&#39;m not trying to be a</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.760" end="01:28:13.199" style="s2">realist i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.560" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">trying to be a pragmatist and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.199" end="01:28:16.639" style="s2">if if i want to use a word</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:18.239" style="s2">right it needs to mean a thing and if it</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.639" end="01:28:19.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean a thing it&#39;s not a word</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.239" end="01:28:22.080" style="s2">right it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">jumbo jumbo so so either it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.080" end="01:28:26.159" style="s2">translated right</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:27.040" style="s2">in you know johnny converse or sorry not</p>

<p begin="01:28:30.800" end="01:28:33.679" style="s2">things are translated from greek in</p>

<p begin="01:28:33.679" end="01:28:37.360" style="s2">things get mistranslated metanoia is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.400" end="01:28:40.320" style="s2">case in point</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.360" end="01:28:42.320" style="s2">because the bible translated metanoia</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.320" end="01:28:43.040" style="s2">from its original meaning of change of</p>

<p begin="01:28:47.440" end="01:28:51.520" style="s2">of what what i&#39;m talking about of</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.920" end="01:28:53.199" style="s2">vicious abstraction i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:29:05.440" end="01:29:10.320" style="s2">is how a lot of it is metaphysical and</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.400" end="01:29:12.639" style="s2">socially constructed</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.320" end="01:29:14.000" style="s2">don&#39;t agree that words have an essence</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.639" end="01:29:17.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.000" end="01:29:17.440" style="s2">and i think we we could defer to john or</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.120" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.440" end="01:29:21.360" style="s2">whoever you know on on that topic maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:23.199" style="s2">maybe you and i are just</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.360" end="01:29:24.880" style="s2">talking past each other and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.199" end="01:29:27.760" style="s2">last thing i want oh no</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.880" end="01:29:29.280" style="s2">well okay i i want your argument right</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.760" end="01:29:32.239" style="s2">so if words don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.280" end="01:29:33.600" style="s2">essence what are we doing like they have</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.239" end="01:29:35.520" style="s2">the essences</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.600" end="01:29:36.960" style="s2">they have essences i mean i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.520" end="01:29:39.199" style="s2">meet you halfway</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.960" end="01:29:42.320" style="s2">and say that they they have enough</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.199" end="01:29:46.080" style="s2">meaning for us to be able to communicate</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.320" end="01:29:49.199" style="s2">but not everybody has the same sort of</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.080" end="01:29:51.360" style="s2">education or</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.199" end="01:29:53.199" style="s2">or primary language growing up maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.360" end="01:29:56.320" style="s2">english is their second life</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.199" end="01:29:58.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not arguing that that is true right</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.320" end="01:30:00.719" style="s2">like that&#39;s a straw man of my position</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.800" end="01:30:03.440" style="s2">i&#39;m not arguing that everybody</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.719" end="01:30:04.080" style="s2">looks at the words the same way right</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.440" end="01:30:06.560" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.080" end="01:30:08.080" style="s2">definitely not what i&#39;m doing right like</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.560" end="01:30:09.280" style="s2">what i&#39;m arguing is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.080" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">platonic form</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.280" end="01:30:12.639" style="s2">right that is being</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.040" end="01:30:19.120" style="s2">symbolized by the word and</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.040" end="01:30:20.800" style="s2">we all have different conceptualizations</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.120" end="01:30:22.560" style="s2">of the platonic form because of our</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.800" end="01:30:25.920" style="s2">historical</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.560" end="01:30:27.600" style="s2">uh upbringing but but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.920" end="01:30:29.440" style="s2">that the form isn&#39;t there and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.600" end="01:30:32.080" style="s2">not talking about the same thing right</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.440" end="01:30:33.040" style="s2">so if if you&#39;re saying the form isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.080" end="01:30:35.840" style="s2">there then</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.040" end="01:30:37.199" style="s2">then then i like i don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.840" end="01:30:39.440" style="s2">communicate with you anymore because i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.199" end="01:30:41.360" style="s2">not talking about the same thing anyway</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.440" end="01:30:42.639" style="s2">and if you say the form is there that</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.360" end="01:30:45.600" style="s2">means that every word</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.639" end="01:30:47.040" style="s2">is pointing at that form so so then</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.600" end="01:30:49.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna have to need a form for</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.040" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">every word like like i don&#39;t see a</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.040" end="01:30:51.840" style="s2">middle ground there</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.159" end="01:30:58.000" style="s2">um yeah i mean this is a very</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.719" end="01:31:02.159" style="s2">philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.000" end="01:31:04.239" style="s2">kind of point and debate</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.159" end="01:31:07.199" style="s2">you know are the forms there are the</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.239" end="01:31:07.199" style="s2">forms not there</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.679" end="01:31:11.840" style="s2">part of my approach would be to say like</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.400" end="01:31:13.040" style="s2">you know it&#39;s important to learn that</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.840" end="01:31:16.560" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.040" end="01:31:18.159" style="s2">but that it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.560" end="01:31:19.679" style="s2">it&#39;s very speculative if it&#39;s neither</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.159" end="01:31:22.159" style="s2">here nor there you know the</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.679" end="01:31:22.880" style="s2">the forms are here the forms are there</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.159" end="01:31:26.639" style="s2">wherever</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.880" end="01:31:27.520" style="s2">like i&#39;m definitely getting lost on one</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.639" end="01:31:30.480" style="s2">end of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.520" end="01:31:32.719" style="s2">conversation about about forms but like</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.480" end="01:31:37.199" style="s2">i like the idea of forms like</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.719" end="01:31:39.840" style="s2">you can&#39;t have forms without abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.199" end="01:31:41.679" style="s2">right the the key i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.840" end="01:31:44.960" style="s2">emphasize here is not plato</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.679" end="01:31:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the process of abstraction itself</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.960" end="01:31:48.159" style="s2">the process of thinking that we all do</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.360" end="01:31:52.000" style="s2">has to be</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.159" end="01:31:52.000" style="s2">understood in a way beyond plato</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.040" end="01:31:56.960" style="s2">so so i think right like okay so so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.400" end="01:31:59.520" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.960" end="01:32:00.239" style="s2">invert it right so i think if you take</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.520" end="01:32:03.520" style="s2">the form</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.239" end="01:32:04.880" style="s2">as primary right then we necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.520" end="01:32:06.800" style="s2">when we have a word we have an</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.880" end="01:32:08.719" style="s2">abstraction of the form</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.800" end="01:32:10.480" style="s2">right we cannot hold the whole constants</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.719" end="01:32:12.239" style="s2">on our minds because that&#39;s too big and</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.480" end="01:32:14.800" style="s2">we have limited life experience</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.239" end="01:32:15.360" style="s2">right so we always gain an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.800" end="01:32:18.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.360" end="01:32:20.000" style="s2">but as long as we hold in our minds that</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.320" end="01:32:21.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re relating to is an abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.000" end="01:32:25.440" style="s2">of something that&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.760" end="01:32:27.600" style="s2">the word then we&#39;re good</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.440" end="01:32:28.639" style="s2">right but that that needs a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.600" end="01:32:30.560" style="s2">humility right</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.639" end="01:32:32.639" style="s2">so so for example right like when you</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.560" end="01:32:33.440" style="s2">when you went to your translation of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.639" end="01:32:36.880" style="s2">metanoia</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.440" end="01:32:38.800" style="s2">into what was it uh repentance</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.880" end="01:32:40.000" style="s2">repentance like i was i was okay with</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.800" end="01:32:42.400" style="s2">that i like i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.000" end="01:32:44.159" style="s2">think that was a mistranslation at all</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.400" end="01:32:46.960" style="s2">so from my conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.159" end="01:32:48.320" style="s2">and my understanding of christianity</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.960" end="01:32:51.040" style="s2">that that is a good</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.320" end="01:32:51.840" style="s2">and a good good representation of that</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.040" end="01:32:55.040" style="s2">concept so</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.840" end="01:32:55.520" style="s2">like that&#39;s precisely what i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.040" end="01:32:59.679" style="s2">at though</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.520" end="01:33:01.679" style="s2">is is if you read what the scholars are</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.679" end="01:33:03.120" style="s2">saying about the translation</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.679" end="01:33:05.600" style="s2">in part i&#39;m just echoing what the</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.120" end="01:33:08.639" style="s2">scholars have said they&#39;re describing it</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.600" end="01:33:11.040" style="s2">as a definite mistranslation right so</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.639" end="01:33:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.040" end="01:33:14.080" style="s2">repentance does make sense in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.280" end="01:33:16.320" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="01:33:14.080" end="01:33:17.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the complete translation</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.320" end="01:33:18.719" style="s2">according to these scholars right these</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.920" end="01:33:22.800" style="s2">are biblical</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.719" end="01:33:24.800" style="s2">scholars and historians philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.800" end="01:33:26.080" style="s2">who are saying that it&#39;s mistranslated</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.800" end="01:33:27.600" style="s2">and not only are they saying that</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.080" end="01:33:28.800" style="s2">there&#39;s for example the book that i</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.600" end="01:33:31.520" style="s2">recommend to john</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.800" end="01:33:35.280" style="s2">in our previous talk that&#39;s unreleased</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.520" end="01:33:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s called metanoia it&#39;s by bloomsbury</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.280" end="01:33:40.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s it it&#39;s developing this concept</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.400" end="01:33:43.679" style="s2">from a cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.080" end="01:33:45.760" style="s2">uh a cognitive theory point of view it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.679" end="01:33:48.880" style="s2">it&#39;s developing the concept of metanoia</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.760" end="01:33:50.560" style="s2">from john&#39;s discipline</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.880" end="01:33:52.400" style="s2">and so that is an authority on the</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.560" end="01:33:54.080" style="s2">concept that is obviously beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.400" end="01:33:56.400" style="s2">bible</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.080" end="01:33:57.120" style="s2">but the bible the biblical scholars are</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.400" end="01:34:00.239" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.120" end="01:34:02.960" style="s2">you know accessing some deep historical</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.239" end="01:34:04.320" style="s2">resonance with the concept and and both</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.960" end="01:34:07.360" style="s2">are interesting to me</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.320" end="01:34:08.800" style="s2">so metanoia is an abstraction good luck</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.360" end="01:34:10.560" style="s2">to finding the form i mean that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.800" end="01:34:12.239" style="s2">i&#39;m saying is we can write and talk</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.560" end="01:34:13.199" style="s2">about these things till the cows come</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.239" end="01:34:16.320" style="s2">home</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.199" end="01:34:17.199" style="s2">and they&#39;re they&#39;re you you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.320" end="01:34:20.239" style="s2">gonna</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.199" end="01:34:23.360" style="s2">draw the shape of it it you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.239" end="01:34:24.159" style="s2">so so a lot of these discourses like</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.360" end="01:34:25.760" style="s2">forms</p>
<p begin="01:34:24.159" end="01:34:28.639" style="s2">just help us get to a certain point like</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.760" end="01:34:32.719" style="s2">plato&#39;s cave is allegorical</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.639" end="01:34:35.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.719" end="01:34:37.120" style="s2">so i&#39;m i&#39;m with you that we&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.600" end="01:34:38.560" style="s2">going to draw the shape</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.120" end="01:34:40.320" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.560" end="01:34:43.040" style="s2">relate to it and and like</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.320" end="01:34:43.760" style="s2">yeah we we have to try we we we have to</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.040" end="01:34:45.760" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.760" end="01:34:46.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to try we do we do it all</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.760" end="01:34:50.080" style="s2">the time and</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.960" end="01:34:51.920" style="s2">and that works fine and like i don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.080" end="01:34:53.840" style="s2">a problem with it the problem is vicious</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.920" end="01:34:55.679" style="s2">abstraction the problem is when</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.840" end="01:34:58.080" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t go fine and people could do</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.679" end="01:35:00.800" style="s2">it intentionally right because they have</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.080" end="01:35:02.960" style="s2">malicious interests or they could do it</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.800" end="01:35:06.480" style="s2">unconsciously because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.960" end="01:35:07.520" style="s2">a a useful idiot to use the term in a</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.480" end="01:35:11.520" style="s2">neutral way like</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.520" end="01:35:14.320" style="s2">you know like so what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.520" end="01:35:15.920" style="s2">is communication is not always pure far</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.320" end="01:35:18.400" style="s2">from it whether we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.920" end="01:35:19.760" style="s2">ordinary people or philosophers i think</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.400" end="01:35:22.400" style="s2">vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.760" end="01:35:23.199" style="s2">happens quite commonly it&#39;s quite it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:22.400" end="01:35:27.520" style="s2">quite</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.199" end="01:35:30.639" style="s2">it happens frequently and it&#39;s common</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.520" end="01:35:33.040" style="s2">it&#39;s bad it&#39;s bad it it increases the</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.639" end="01:35:35.840" style="s2">noise in the signal</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.040" end="01:35:37.119" style="s2">so my my whole thesis there is just that</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.840" end="01:35:39.760" style="s2">vicious abstraction is</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.119" end="01:35:40.800" style="s2">is bad that&#39;s what william james says</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.760" end="01:35:43.840" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.800" end="01:35:44.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what i wrote about it in the</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.840" end="01:35:48.400" style="s2">context of</p>
<p begin="01:35:44.800" end="01:35:51.040" style="s2">of racism because there was a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.400" end="01:35:51.840" style="s2">the historical abstraction of race</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.040" end="01:35:56.159" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.840" end="01:35:59.199" style="s2">from like uh you know slurs</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.159" end="01:36:02.480" style="s2">to coded language like redlining</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.199" end="01:36:03.760" style="s2">or forced busing or states rights states</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.480" end="01:36:06.480" style="s2">rights</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.760" end="01:36:06.800" style="s2">were actually ways to make more abstract</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.480" end="01:36:10.320" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.800" end="01:36:13.360" style="s2">the values of racism which um</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.320" end="01:36:15.679" style="s2">republican voters in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.360" end="01:36:16.960" style="s2">uh 60s and this you know according to</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.679" end="01:36:20.880" style="s2">the southern strategy</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.960" end="01:36:23.199" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:36:20.880" end="01:36:24.080" style="s2">appealed to voters it was was coded</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.199" end="01:36:25.520" style="s2">racism so</p>
<p begin="01:36:24.080" end="01:36:27.280" style="s2">those that was a kind of vicious</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.520" end="01:36:28.159" style="s2">abstraction because they&#39;re mis they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.280" end="01:36:29.840" style="s2">they&#39;re mis</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.159" end="01:36:31.840" style="s2">not in now this isn&#39;t an example of</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.840" end="01:36:34.320" style="s2">mistranslation</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.840" end="01:36:36.320" style="s2">misquotation but it&#39;s another example of</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.320" end="01:36:39.119" style="s2">vicious abstraction which is</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.320" end="01:36:40.719" style="s2">using different coded language right</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.119" end="01:36:43.760" style="s2">that&#39;s dehumanization</p>
<p begin="01:36:40.719" end="01:36:46.000" style="s2">right so first first i was tracking your</p>
<p begin="01:36:43.760" end="01:36:47.040" style="s2">your description of fish&#39;s abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.000" end="01:36:50.880" style="s2">as idolatry</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.040" end="01:36:53.920" style="s2">right um as misquotation</p>
<p begin="01:36:50.880" end="01:36:56.880" style="s2">as a kind of false representation</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.920" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">and taken out of context um idolatry can</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.880" end="01:36:59.520" style="s2">be part of it</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.719" end="01:37:03.920" style="s2">right so under this one is is</p>
<p begin="01:37:02.760" end="01:37:08.400" style="s2">dehumanization</p>
<p begin="01:37:03.920" end="01:37:11.280" style="s2">right so where you where you uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:08.400" end="01:37:11.679" style="s2">drag the human out of the context and</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.280" end="01:37:14.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.679" end="01:37:17.119" style="s2">and make it a more objective</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.880" end="01:37:19.520" style="s2">language where where where it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.119" end="01:37:22.560" style="s2">relate to to the individual anymore</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.520" end="01:37:25.199" style="s2">but yeah like i think</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.560" end="01:37:26.480" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna see the floor but those those</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.199" end="01:37:29.520" style="s2">things have been</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.480" end="01:37:30.400" style="s2">talked about since i appreciate the</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.520" end="01:37:33.440" style="s2">chance to</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.400" end="01:37:36.480" style="s2">try to unpack both abstraction and</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.440" end="01:37:36.480" style="s2">vicious abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.159" end="01:37:44.639" style="s2">well thank you that that was great uh</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.280" end="01:37:46.880" style="s2">i really appreciate you staying staying</p>
