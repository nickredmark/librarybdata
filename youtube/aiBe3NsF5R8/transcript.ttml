<p begin="00:00:03.980" end="00:00:09.750" style="s2">welcome this is our second question and</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.379" end="00:00:12.900" style="s2">answer session and I appreciate all of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.750" end="00:00:16.800" style="s2">the enthusiasm first of all like again I</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.900" end="00:00:20.189" style="s2">want to say thank you to my viewers the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.800" end="00:00:22.519" style="s2">amount of feedback it&#39;s been and support</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.189" end="00:00:25.650" style="s2">has been really really wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.519" end="00:00:29.070" style="s2">I&#39;ve also been impressed by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.650" end="00:00:31.740" style="s2">enthusiasm for this Q&amp;A session I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.070" end="00:00:33.870" style="s2">to start by addressing a couple of big</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.740" end="00:00:35.660" style="s2">questions that have surfaced through the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.870" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">video series especially some of the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.660" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">episodes that have been posted and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:43.559" style="s2">they&#39;re sort of central and then after</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">that I&#39;ll address some questions that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.559" end="00:00:47.160" style="s2">have been tweeted and then at the end</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">we&#39;ll try and get into some live</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.160" end="00:00:51.860" style="s2">questions so the one thing I want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">start with is this issue around</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.860" end="00:00:57.449" style="s2">personhood because there has been some</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">discussion about like what am I saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.449" end="00:01:02.579" style="s2">about personhood and what was I saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">about the newborn and I want to try and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.579" end="00:01:09.330" style="s2">go over this really really carefully</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:14.820" style="s2">about the ontology personhood so I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.330" end="00:01:17.549" style="s2">arguing that agape was necessary or at</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.820" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">least indispensable to the formation of</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.549" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">personhood and then some people are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:22.110" style="s2">asking questions about what did that</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">mean about what I thought about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.110" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">ontology of a newborn etc so let me be</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:33.900" style="s2">very clear that I think a newborn has</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">the real potential for personhood and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.900" end="00:01:40.680" style="s2">you note I made explicit attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:43.259" style="s2">argue in the episode on Aristotle I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.680" end="00:01:45.899" style="s2">believe it&#39;s episode 6 that possibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.259" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">and potentiality are real they are a</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.899" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">definite part of the ontology and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">think that saying that a newborn has the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">real potential is exactly what commits</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:02:01.200" style="s2">us to our moral responsibilities to them</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">so to use a term that poetically uses I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.200" end="00:02:07.049" style="s2">think newborns have a a moral status as</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">persons precisely because that real</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.049" end="00:02:12.569" style="s2">potential to be actualized as a person</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">it can only be actualized by the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.569" end="00:02:19.409" style="s2">informing of agape love and so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:21.569" style="s2">moral obligation to bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.409" end="00:02:25.170" style="s2">actualization of that real potential</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.569" end="00:02:27.269" style="s2">through a gothic love and we do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.170" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">because of course persons are</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.269" end="00:02:34.670" style="s2">intrinsically valuable to us now that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:37.739" style="s2">being said we should not confuse</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.670" end="00:02:40.980" style="s2">potentiality and actuality to say that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.739" end="00:02:42.629" style="s2">newborn is potentially a person and here</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.980" end="00:02:44.930" style="s2">I&#39;m speaking very technically and very</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.629" end="00:02:48.450" style="s2">accurately is to say that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.930" end="00:02:49.950" style="s2">actually a person because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.450" end="00:02:53.819" style="s2">difference between actuality and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.950" end="00:02:55.859" style="s2">potentiality it needs agape to become an</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.819" end="00:03:00.449" style="s2">actual person as opposed to being a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.859" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">really potential person and that matters</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.449" end="00:03:05.909" style="s2">because we value actuality different</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:07.829" style="s2">than we value potentiality you would</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.909" end="00:03:08.760" style="s2">rather have actual money than potential</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.829" end="00:03:10.530" style="s2">money this has even been shown</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.760" end="00:03:13.769" style="s2">experimentally you will take a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.530" end="00:03:16.109" style="s2">bit of actual money now over you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.769" end="00:03:18.209" style="s2">the real potential for money in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.109" end="00:03:20.489" style="s2">future so the valuation and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.209" end="00:03:23.489" style="s2">metaphysical status are importantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.489" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">different and notice that when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.489" end="00:03:27.419" style="s2">okay well what make something actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:29.759" style="s2">actually a person you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.419" end="00:03:34.639" style="s2">well what makes what is it to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.759" end="00:03:37.470" style="s2">person and notice that we don&#39;t treat</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.639" end="00:03:38.729" style="s2">infants as beings that can act as</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.470" end="00:03:39.989" style="s2">persons they&#39;re not allowed to own</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.729" end="00:03:41.639" style="s2">property they&#39;re not allowed to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.989" end="00:03:43.769" style="s2">married they do not have freedom of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.639" end="00:03:46.349" style="s2">religion they cannot go where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.769" end="00:03:50.009" style="s2">choose right they and also they cannot</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.349" end="00:03:52.829" style="s2">commit a crime they are in no way moral</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.009" end="00:03:54.780" style="s2">agents in an important sense we do not</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.829" end="00:03:58.139" style="s2">treat them that way that does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.780" end="00:03:59.939" style="s2">that we do not have an agape and moral</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.139" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">responsibility to them of course we do</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.939" end="00:04:04.829" style="s2">and that&#39;s has what I have just argued</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:08.129" style="s2">and then the thing - the thing to then</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.829" end="00:04:11.189" style="s2">ask is well what is it to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.129" end="00:04:13.560" style="s2">person and then to use a contrast that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.189" end="00:04:15.269" style="s2">many people use that love you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.560" end="00:04:17.940" style="s2">can love a dogged optically and it will</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.269" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">never become a person I agree and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.940" end="00:04:23.279" style="s2">is it that a dog will never have what in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:25.349" style="s2">what way will the dog not be able to act</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.279" end="00:04:26.410" style="s2">as a person certainly dogs have</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.349" end="00:04:29.260" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:32.030" style="s2">certainly they have intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.260" end="00:04:33.980" style="s2">certainly they have emotion certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.030" end="00:04:35.990" style="s2">they are able to enter to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.980" end="00:04:39.710" style="s2">long term social relationships that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.990" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">exactly why we have dogs in our houses</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.710" end="00:04:45.140" style="s2">and we treat them as members of our</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:46.690" style="s2">family right but what is it a dog will</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.140" end="00:04:48.830" style="s2">never have well the dog will never have</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.690" end="00:04:50.900" style="s2">moral agency it will never have</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.830" end="00:04:52.940" style="s2">reflective rationality it will never</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:55.520" style="s2">have the capacity for self selphie</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.940" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">antral self transcendence and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.520" end="00:05:01.370" style="s2">exactly what is still missing in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:04.700" style="s2">newborn the newborn cannot act in any of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.370" end="00:05:06.890" style="s2">those passions so when I said that a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.700" end="00:05:09.800" style="s2">newborn in that sense is not actually a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.890" end="00:05:13.070" style="s2">person but that is what I met and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.800" end="00:05:15.170" style="s2">again is not lessening our moral</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.070" end="00:05:17.630" style="s2">responsibility towards the newborn it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.170" end="00:05:21.320" style="s2">increasing it because as I&#39;ve just said</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.630" end="00:05:23.210" style="s2">the newborn has the real potential to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.320" end="00:05:26.440" style="s2">a person and that thereby really</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.210" end="00:05:29.600" style="s2">obligates us to provide for them the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.440" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">information of a gothic love that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.600" end="00:05:35.870" style="s2">actualize that potential into personhood</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">now that there might be some other ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.870" end="00:05:39.620" style="s2">in which you might still object you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:42.200" style="s2">might say well human beings are in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.620" end="00:05:44.300" style="s2">image of God some people said that and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.200" end="00:05:47.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that is fair to me I made</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.300" end="00:05:50.750" style="s2">it clear that I&#39;m not a Christian and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.540" end="00:05:53.780" style="s2">simply asserting a doctrine to me is</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.750" end="00:05:56.180" style="s2">unfair to me there&#39;s no there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.780" end="00:05:58.100" style="s2">no shared normativity between you and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.180" end="00:06:00.410" style="s2">if that&#39;s all that&#39;s happening I have no</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.100" end="00:06:03.290" style="s2">way of responding to them if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.410" end="00:06:04.640" style="s2">just asserting a doctrine but you are</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.290" end="00:06:06.260" style="s2">making a metaphysical claim the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.640" end="00:06:08.480" style="s2">metaphysical claim might be something</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.260" end="00:06:10.790" style="s2">like well human beings have souls and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.480" end="00:06:12.620" style="s2">animals do not I would would like to</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.790" end="00:06:14.780" style="s2">first pause here and note that that has</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.620" end="00:06:16.310" style="s2">that doctrine or at least that assertion</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.780" end="00:06:17.990" style="s2">because I want to make a distinction I</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.310" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">should here between a doctrine an</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.990" end="00:06:22.910" style="s2">assertion so I want to correct myself</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:25.550" style="s2">that assertion right has not also been</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.910" end="00:06:27.320" style="s2">morally innocent it has served as a</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.550" end="00:06:31.670" style="s2">justification for a lot of cruelty and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.320" end="00:06:35.780" style="s2">in human inhumane action towards animals</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.670" end="00:06:37.580" style="s2">so we have to be careful about that so</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.780" end="00:06:38.900" style="s2">this notion of a soul is a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.580" end="00:06:40.310" style="s2">problematic notion</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.900" end="00:06:41.900" style="s2">and meaning and that overlaps with</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.310" end="00:06:44.080" style="s2">another question that people have about</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.900" end="00:06:48.550" style="s2">you know why my commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.080" end="00:06:48.550" style="s2">physicalism and then that is usually</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.420" end="00:06:54.140" style="s2">discussed in connection to the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.620" end="00:06:55.370" style="s2">of consciousness and the idea is that</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.820" end="00:13:26.600" style="s2">of this ilk are designed to show that</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:28.250" style="s2">two things could be causally and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.600" end="00:13:30.260" style="s2">functionally identical and have</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.250" end="00:13:32.029" style="s2">fundamentally different qualia and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.260" end="00:13:35.750" style="s2">means that there will be no physicalist</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.029" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">explanation of qualia as I&#39;ve said I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.750" end="00:13:40.850" style="s2">think this only applies to adjectives</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:44.899" style="s2">Ollie are not a verbal qualia so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.850" end="00:13:46.610" style="s2">grant the possibility that adjectives of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.899" end="00:13:49.010" style="s2">qualia can not be given a physical</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.610" end="00:13:51.920" style="s2">explanation this is a very Pyrrhic</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.010" end="00:13:53.959" style="s2">victory because the that argument that</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.920" end="00:13:55.940" style="s2">shows that qualia cannot be given a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.959" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">physical explanation also shows that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.940" end="00:14:01.820" style="s2">qualia have no causal powers that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:04.279" style="s2">have no determining difference making</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.820" end="00:14:06.260" style="s2">capacity for your behavior</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.279" end="00:14:08.600" style="s2">they cannot change your behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.260" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">this is part of the larger problem that</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.600" end="00:14:16.870" style="s2">if the mind is in some way non-physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:19.519" style="s2">it can&#39;t causally interact with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.870" end="00:14:22.730" style="s2">undeniably physical nature of your body</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:24.620" style="s2">and so what you end up having to say and</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.730" end="00:14:27.200" style="s2">this is of course what some philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.620" end="00:14:29.810" style="s2">find worrying is that these qualia which</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.200" end="00:14:32.180" style="s2">are so central to the claim that</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.810" end="00:14:34.520" style="s2">consciousness is non-physical are epi</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.180" end="00:14:35.750" style="s2">phenomenal they have no causal role they</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.520" end="00:14:41.770" style="s2">have no causal function</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.750" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">they can&#39;t affect your behavior etc so</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.770" end="00:14:47.690" style="s2">that is as I say that&#39;s a very Pyrrhic</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:51.140" style="s2">victory it seems to me the opposite is</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.690" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">true that it is the felt nastiness of</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.140" end="00:14:55.490" style="s2">pain that is somehow affecting my</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.320" style="s2">behavior my physical behavior I touch</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.490" end="00:15:00.589" style="s2">the Fargo aisle and my hand moves back</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.320" end="00:15:02.930" style="s2">that&#39;s a physical motion and so it seems</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.589" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">more plausible to me that qualia must</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.930" end="00:15:09.589" style="s2">have some causal capacity and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:10.930" style="s2">they should ultimately be capable of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.589" end="00:15:14.060" style="s2">being given a physical a physical</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.930" end="00:15:17.839" style="s2">explanation now even if that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.060" end="00:15:20.690" style="s2">case and I keep admitting there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.839" end="00:15:22.730" style="s2">people I respect who would say no no in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.690" end="00:15:26.600" style="s2">the end qualia are non-physical I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.730" end="00:15:31.100" style="s2">accept their epi phenomenal status right</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.600" end="00:15:34.570" style="s2">I wonder of whether or not they are</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.100" end="00:15:37.280" style="s2">the constitutive of consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.570" end="00:15:38.330" style="s2">many people have reported informant has</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.280" end="00:15:39.860" style="s2">written books on this and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.330" end="00:15:41.480" style="s2">experienced myself that in a deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.860" end="00:15:42.920" style="s2">meditative state you can get to a state</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.480" end="00:15:45.050" style="s2">called the pure consciousness event</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.920" end="00:15:47.030" style="s2">you&#39;re not conscious of anything</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.050" end="00:15:49.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no you&#39;re not conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.030" end="00:15:50.810" style="s2">yourself you&#39;re not conscious of redness</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.160" end="00:15:53.090" style="s2">or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.810" end="00:15:55.310" style="s2">you&#39;re it&#39;s a pure consciousness event</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.090" end="00:15:56.600" style="s2">so there are no adjectives of qualia in</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.310" end="00:15:59.270" style="s2">your consciousness at all that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:15:59.270" end="00:16:03.110" style="s2">important is the adverbial qualia are</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.430" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">still there there&#39;s a hereness and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.110" end="00:16:08.540" style="s2">noun and a unity to your experience so</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">the adverbial qualia don&#39;t throw away</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.540" end="00:16:14.060" style="s2">the object type of qualia do and that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:17.210" style="s2">I think just an incontrovertible</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.210" end="00:16:21.680" style="s2">necessary for consciousness that you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.370" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">have consciousness without them</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.680" end="00:16:28.700" style="s2">and so again they&#39;re the arguments for</p>

<p begin="00:16:28.700" end="00:16:32.510" style="s2">best a few phenomenal they do not seem</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.890" end="00:17:10.160" style="s2">think good arguments for the position</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.860" end="00:17:16.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s you know it&#39;s Dogma and</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.050" end="00:17:40.820" style="s2">because although they&#39;re distinct</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.820" end="00:17:46.430" style="s2">important ways there&#39;s another question</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.750" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">question or series of comments that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.430" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">want to address and then I&#39;ll get to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:56.210" style="s2">tweeted ones and then I&#39;ll get hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:58.670" style="s2">to some of the live ones this has to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.210" end="00:17:59.990" style="s2">with some people saying to me things</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.670" end="00:18:01.670" style="s2">along the phone lines that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.990" end="00:18:03.080" style="s2">basically just sort of say well you know</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.540" end="00:18:11.330" style="s2">and there&#39;s often a bit of a I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:20:23.210" end="00:20:28.520" style="s2">say yes I get that what I&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.030" end="00:20:30.890" style="s2">self undermining but I accept the self</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.520" end="00:20:33.020" style="s2">undermining and what I&#39;m actually saying</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.890" end="00:20:34.730" style="s2">is it completely self undermines and</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.020" end="00:20:39.380" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing and I embrace the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.730" end="00:20:44.660" style="s2">of absolute skepticism I accept that as</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.380" end="00:20:47.780" style="s2">a possible position but then what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.660" end="00:20:50.450" style="s2">have to I would argue what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.780" end="00:20:53.180" style="s2">agree to is that that position is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.450" end="00:20:55.220" style="s2">adopted on the basis of argumentation or</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.180" end="00:20:57.410" style="s2">evidence precisely because you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.220" end="00:20:59.450" style="s2">denied the possibility of argumentation</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.410" end="00:21:02.690" style="s2">because you&#39;ve denied belief and truth</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.450" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">and you rely if the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.690" end="00:21:07.940" style="s2">evidence which is also required because</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:10.340" style="s2">evidence is defined as something that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.940" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">changes beliefs because of its potential</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.340" end="00:21:16.880" style="s2">truth etc so all of that being said what</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:21.310" style="s2">that means is trying to assert that</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.880" end="00:21:25.060" style="s2">there is no meaning is a very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.310" end="00:21:27.650" style="s2">position to sustain now maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.060" end="00:21:29.180" style="s2">but simply asserting F or asserting it</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:31.910" style="s2">as obvious or that&#39;s what we should</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.180" end="00:21:34.100" style="s2">conclude I think is very problematic now</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.910" end="00:21:36.530" style="s2">as our history led us to the prevalence</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.100" end="00:21:38.210" style="s2">of nihilism very much and I acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.530" end="00:21:40.790" style="s2">that that&#39;s part of what the series is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.210" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">saying but you might be saying as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.790" end="00:21:46.910" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s meaning but the value of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:49.940" style="s2">it is it is a delusion again the value</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.910" end="00:21:52.340" style="s2">of truth and the value of meaning are</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.940" end="00:21:56.390" style="s2">bound up together and if you value truth</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.340" end="00:21:58.940" style="s2">then of course it you are you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.390" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">required to value meaning and so again</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.940" end="00:22:05.170" style="s2">saying that that&#39;s a delusion or</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.620" end="00:22:08.200" style="s2">illusory illusion is is very hard to</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.170" end="00:22:11.259" style="s2">maintain again</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.200" end="00:22:14.769" style="s2">I am NOT trying to refute nihilism as a</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.769" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">that it is the obvious clear</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.279" end="00:22:23.440" style="s2">indisputable conclusion we should just</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:25.480" style="s2">simply accept you know that meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.440" end="00:22:27.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist or that we shouldn&#39;t value</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.480" end="00:22:30.669" style="s2">it I try to show why that is deeply</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.580" end="00:22:32.739" style="s2">deeply problematic I&#39;ll try to in the in</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.669" end="00:22:35.350" style="s2">this in the course of the series advance</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.739" end="00:22:39.999" style="s2">other arguments as to both the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.350" end="00:22:42.429" style="s2">indispensability of meaning and a way I</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.999" end="00:22:47.409" style="s2">think of understanding it that can fit</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.429" end="00:22:49.179" style="s2">it back into our ontology and and by not</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.409" end="00:22:50.980" style="s2">putting it so easily into our</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.179" end="00:22:52.749" style="s2">established epistemological categories</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.980" end="00:22:57.489" style="s2">of either subjectivity or objectivity</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.749" end="00:22:59.769" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s an argument that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.489" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">have to just promise because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.769" end="00:23:05.980" style="s2">coming in the series so though that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:08.499" style="s2">lot of the heavy lifting and I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.980" end="00:23:12.609" style="s2">address those three questions because</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.499" end="00:23:14.619" style="s2">many people were bringing them up in one</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.609" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">way or the other and I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.619" end="00:23:21.940" style="s2">show and you know I understand like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">know you can&#39;t make all the arguments</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.940" end="00:23:26.950" style="s2">that you need to make when you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:29.379" style="s2">a statement and so I&#39;m not taking this</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.950" end="00:23:32.350" style="s2">opportunity to try and lay out some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.379" end="00:23:34.950" style="s2">the arguments for some of the claims</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.350" end="00:23:37.950" style="s2">I&#39;ve made again trying to show you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.950" end="00:23:40.299" style="s2">these there are there is reason behind</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.950" end="00:23:42.999" style="s2">some of the claims I&#39;m making that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.299" end="00:23:46.149" style="s2">not just you know a dogmatic adherence</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.999" end="00:23:48.489" style="s2">to a scientific worldview or that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.149" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">know I swim with scientists so I have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.489" end="00:23:54.039" style="s2">be quiet about certain things so now I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:57.429" style="s2">like to pass on to some of the questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.039" end="00:24:00.399" style="s2">that were tweeted and then we&#39;ll shift</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.429" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">gears a little bit here because these</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.399" end="00:24:04.809" style="s2">questions I think are and I don&#39;t this</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:07.749" style="s2">is not meant to be in any way a</p>

<p begin="00:24:07.749" end="00:24:10.239" style="s2">tend to be a little bit more practical</p>

<p begin="00:24:10.239" end="00:24:16.349" style="s2">philosophical and full-blown theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.359" end="00:24:18.340" style="s2">us one question is how can one not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.349" end="00:24:22.049" style="s2">autodidactic in a place where there is</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.340" end="00:24:25.019" style="s2">no wisdom center so yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.049" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">I take this question very very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.019" end="00:24:31.349" style="s2">I am I will remain critical of</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.200" end="00:24:33.539" style="s2">autodidact ISM but the fact that for</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.349" end="00:24:35.639" style="s2">many of us there are no wisdom centers</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.539" end="00:24:37.799" style="s2">often means where we are thrust into</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.639" end="00:24:40.440" style="s2">this that is precisely one of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.799" end="00:24:42.149" style="s2">problematic aspects or dimensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.440" end="00:24:44.249" style="s2">meaning crisis that we shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.149" end="00:24:46.649" style="s2">autodidactic in the pursuit of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.249" end="00:24:50.009" style="s2">but we seem to be forced into it because</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.649" end="00:24:54.839" style="s2">of a lack of you know traditions guides</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.009" end="00:24:57.089" style="s2">and centers I don&#39;t have a good answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.839" end="00:25:02.129" style="s2">to that other than to tell you what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.089" end="00:25:03.359" style="s2">trying to do about it I mean so as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.129" end="00:25:04.499" style="s2">said before one of the gifts of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.359" end="00:25:06.509" style="s2">theories as I get to and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.499" end="00:25:09.359" style="s2">increasingly interacting with people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.509" end="00:25:12.210" style="s2">are who are scenting setting up such</p>

<p begin="00:25:12.210" end="00:25:19.559" style="s2">there&#39;s real time and real talent being</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.559" end="00:25:21.869" style="s2">very preliminary fashion and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.759" end="00:25:22.859" style="s2">started to talk to some of these people</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.869" end="00:25:25.169" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get them to network</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.859" end="00:25:28.109" style="s2">together and to join and to link up with</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.169" end="00:25:29.729" style="s2">other networks we would like to create</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.109" end="00:25:33.899" style="s2">something like a virtual wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.729" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">Institute where we create a co-op that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.899" end="00:25:40.169" style="s2">would help to vet these various groups</p>

<p begin="00:25:47.089" end="00:25:53.729" style="s2">that would help to address this concern</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:58.549" style="s2">of giving people places where they can</p>

<p begin="00:25:58.549" end="00:26:05.700" style="s2">wisdom and self transformation and a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.139" end="00:26:09.989" style="s2">less autodidactic fashion and so as I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.700" end="00:26:13.710" style="s2">said I&#39;m trying what I can about that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.989" end="00:26:14.700" style="s2">also plan to release although this</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.710" end="00:26:17.129" style="s2">doesn&#39;t completely address the</p>

<p begin="00:26:23.639" end="00:26:27.779" style="s2">this practice but hopefully the goal for</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.859" end="00:26:29.070" style="s2">that is to not to reinforce people you</p>

<p begin="00:26:55.470" end="00:27:00.960" style="s2">you mean by that I mean I enjoy playing</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.769" end="00:27:02.789" style="s2">certain sports I enjoy playing soccer</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.960" end="00:27:05.700" style="s2">played it a lot in high school and</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.679" end="00:27:39.659" style="s2">the psychology of sport and of coaching</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.899" end="00:27:42.109" style="s2">because that has been very informative</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.399" end="00:28:12.059" style="s2">psychology so what&#39;s my daily routine or</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.830" end="00:28:15.539" style="s2">habits I was interviewed about this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.059" end="00:28:19.049" style="s2">I talked about it I&#39;m not quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.539" end="00:28:21.869" style="s2">what to say about that Mike my days my</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.049" end="00:28:24.989" style="s2">days have some constants in them and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.869" end="00:28:27.450" style="s2">there but there&#39;s also parts that are</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.989" end="00:28:30.359" style="s2">very different I usually begin the day I</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.450" end="00:28:33.419" style="s2">have Meniere&#39;s disease as some of you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.359" end="00:28:35.119" style="s2">may know it&#39;s an unfortunate disorder</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.419" end="00:28:38.429" style="s2">it&#39;s chronic and there&#39;s no known cure</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.119" end="00:28:40.919" style="s2">and what will periodically happen is my</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.429" end="00:28:42.600" style="s2">inner ear will fill up with fluid and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.919" end="00:28:45.299" style="s2">that will put tremendous pressure on my</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.600" end="00:28:48.899" style="s2">inner ear and I&#39;ll get ringing in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.299" end="00:28:52.110" style="s2">ear pain tremendous vertigo vomiting</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.899" end="00:28:54.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s I would not wish it on my</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.110" end="00:28:58.350" style="s2">worst enemy or nemesis it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.870" end="00:29:01.460" style="s2">I&#39;ll take pain really really bad pain</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.350" end="00:29:04.429" style="s2">over that experience so I&#39;d start my day</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.460" end="00:29:08.009" style="s2">with having to do a series of exercises</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.429" end="00:29:11.580" style="s2">that are designed to try and moderate</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.009" end="00:29:13.830" style="s2">and alleviate the veneers and then that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.580" end="00:29:17.340" style="s2">usually leads into a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.830" end="00:29:19.740" style="s2">practices I do I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.340" end="00:29:23.210" style="s2">various forms of Tai Chi Chuan I do some</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.740" end="00:29:27.950" style="s2">Chi cung I do some pranayama some yoga</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.210" end="00:29:31.950" style="s2">and then I do sitted meditative practice</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.950" end="00:29:35.399" style="s2">contemplative practice and then I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.950" end="00:29:38.220" style="s2">some other Safian chill practices drawn</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.399" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">from the Neoplatonic tradition and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.220" end="00:29:43.649" style="s2">I generally do some lectio divina I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:44.789" style="s2">not reading a Bible and I mean no insult</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.649" end="00:29:46.409" style="s2">to Christianity although there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.789" end="00:29:49.619" style="s2">evidence that lectio Divina is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.409" end="00:29:51.149" style="s2">specifically of Christian origin so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.619" end="00:29:52.919" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that that&#39;s inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.149" end="00:29:55.289" style="s2">there seems to be some evidence that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.919" end="00:29:57.740" style="s2">goes back to a Neoplatonic heritage so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.289" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">will often do a lectio divina this is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.740" end="00:30:02.549" style="s2">special kind of reading that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:05.850" style="s2">already talked about in in the series</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.549" end="00:30:08.490" style="s2">and right I&#39;ll do that with some</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.850" end="00:30:10.559" style="s2">Neoplatonic texts I&#39;ll do that with a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.490" end="00:30:14.940" style="s2">Taoist text and some Buddhist texts and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.559" end="00:30:18.450" style="s2">so I started today with a series of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.940" end="00:30:20.490" style="s2">practices that way and then my game</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.450" end="00:30:22.679" style="s2">varies considerably sometimes I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.490" end="00:30:24.749" style="s2">teaching and other times I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.679" end="00:30:26.879" style="s2">research sometimes that research</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.749" end="00:30:29.759" style="s2">involves discussing with other people</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.879" end="00:30:32.909" style="s2">sometimes it involves you know looking</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.759" end="00:30:34.289" style="s2">at the work that&#39;s done in my lab on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.909" end="00:30:36.690" style="s2">some of the experiments we&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.289" end="00:30:41.700" style="s2">consciousness and wisdom Studies lab so</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.690" end="00:30:43.799" style="s2">I have no I hope sorry that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.700" end="00:30:47.009" style="s2">strong statement right I hope I have no</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.799" end="00:30:48.330" style="s2">delusions about how privileged I am</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.009" end="00:30:52.110" style="s2">I mean I&#39;ve worked very hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.330" end="00:30:55.379" style="s2">where I am but I&#39;m very lucky in that I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.110" end="00:30:57.480" style="s2">get to do work that I find very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.379" end="00:30:59.490" style="s2">meaningful and to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.480" end="00:31:02.899" style="s2">colleagues and students that you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.490" end="00:31:02.899" style="s2">these are bright</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.970" end="00:31:10.590" style="s2">fried enthusiastic interesting people</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.179" end="00:31:14.070" style="s2">and so I I&#39;m just extremely grateful for</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.590" end="00:31:19.320" style="s2">that and I acknowledge that that leads</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.070" end="00:31:21.480" style="s2">to another question so there is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.320" end="00:31:23.220" style="s2">question about you know finding work</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.480" end="00:31:24.929" style="s2">which alleviates or engages in</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.220" end="00:31:27.420" style="s2">alleviating the meaning crisis are there</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.929" end="00:31:29.610" style="s2">institutions or organizations that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.420" end="00:31:32.460" style="s2">you know awful useful help for people</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.610" end="00:31:35.610" style="s2">who want to develop wisdom or essential</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.460" end="00:31:38.220" style="s2">psycho technologies there are again</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.610" end="00:31:40.950" style="s2">that&#39;s part and again I&#39;m not the expert</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.220" end="00:31:43.650" style="s2">in this I&#39;m learning about it because</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.950" end="00:31:46.200" style="s2">I&#39;m coming into contact with you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.650" end="00:31:49.470" style="s2">groups of people who are setting things</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.200" end="00:31:52.290" style="s2">I had a wonderful discussion with a</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:56.220" style="s2">person from obscure plen this morning</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.290" end="00:31:57.960" style="s2">and he does some really interesting work</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.220" end="00:32:01.170" style="s2">he set up a charitable organization in</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.960" end="00:32:05.580" style="s2">which he&#39;s teaching mindfulness to youth</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.170" end="00:32:08.970" style="s2">at risk to prison inmates to adults</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.580" end="00:32:10.980" style="s2">going and facing trauma and so and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.970" end="00:32:12.840" style="s2">wanted to talk to me because he wants he</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.980" end="00:32:17.429" style="s2">was considering ways about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.840" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">broadening that to to address the issues</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.429" end="00:32:20.910" style="s2">around the meeting crisis because he</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:24.179" style="s2">took he was making a case a case I agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.910" end="00:32:26.880" style="s2">with by the way that a lot of the mental</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.179" end="00:32:28.440" style="s2">health issue is is actually exacerbated</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:31.260" style="s2">and perhaps in some sense derivative</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.440" end="00:32:33.929" style="s2">from the mental health crisis is</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.260" end="00:32:36.780" style="s2">exacerbated and derivative from the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.929" end="00:32:40.830" style="s2">other meaning crisis so there are there</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.780" end="00:32:43.920" style="s2">are people who are setting up places</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.830" end="00:32:45.929" style="s2">where they teach places where there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.920" end="00:32:47.580" style="s2">an integration of teaching and therapy</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.929" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">there&#39;s a places where there&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.580" end="00:32:56.250" style="s2">tradition of teaching therapy and and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:57.720" style="s2">community building and so III my hope</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.250" end="00:32:59.580" style="s2">and and there&#39;s at least some</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.720" end="00:33:01.770" style="s2">preliminary evidence for this is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.580" end="00:33:03.420" style="s2">this will be a growing sector of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.770" end="00:33:05.070" style="s2">economy I think some of the more</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.420" end="00:33:09.870" style="s2">traditional sectors there&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.070" end="00:33:12.809" style="s2">avenues within teaching within therapy</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.870" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously all kinds of important</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.809" end="00:33:16.830" style="s2">work you know in which</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:19.890" style="s2">doing care for people palliative care in</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.830" end="00:33:22.920" style="s2">which all of this is important of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.890" end="00:33:25.290" style="s2">you may want to go into the root help</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.920" end="00:33:26.549" style="s2">facilitate some of the research on this</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.290" end="00:33:27.870" style="s2">you know research that&#39;s going into</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.549" end="00:33:30.660" style="s2">psychedelics altered states of</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.870" end="00:33:33.390" style="s2">consciousness meaning in life so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.660" end="00:33:35.850" style="s2">would be an academic thing so that is my</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.390" end="00:33:38.700" style="s2">best answer right now I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.850" end="00:33:41.790" style="s2">it&#39;s not that satisfying an answer and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.700" end="00:33:48.710" style="s2">like I said I&#39;m hoping that this will</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.790" end="00:33:52.890" style="s2">gel and grow as a part of a part of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.710" end="00:33:55.320" style="s2">economy it will need to because</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.890" end="00:33:58.200" style="s2">loneliness and meaninglessness are</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.320" end="00:34:01.799" style="s2">growing we&#39;re facing the aging of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.200" end="00:34:03.540" style="s2">population which tends to increase the</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.799" end="00:34:10.260" style="s2">possibilities of meaninglessness and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.540" end="00:34:11.850" style="s2">loneliness and things like that the</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.850" end="00:34:15.480" style="s2">is there something regular people can</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.500" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">trust inside or outside of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.480" end="00:34:20.730" style="s2">that helps them to avoid being lied to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:23.190" style="s2">mostly so-called saviors who take</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.730" end="00:34:25.050" style="s2">advantage of the need for meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.190" end="00:34:29.780" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot in that question that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.050" end="00:34:31.980" style="s2">think is so the question is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.780" end="00:34:36.270" style="s2">this is part of the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.980" end="00:34:38.280" style="s2">distrust that has built up and and of</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.270" end="00:34:41.129" style="s2">course the fact that we still hunger for</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.280" end="00:34:43.950" style="s2">Heroes is easily evidenced by you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.129" end="00:34:45.990" style="s2">the success of things like endgame the</p>

<p begin="00:34:48.090" end="00:34:58.500" style="s2">and we talked about that in the book</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.869" end="00:35:00.840" style="s2">Chris and fell open on so it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.500" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">real concern that people take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.840" end="00:35:09.510" style="s2">of our need so here&#39;s why I think we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">need for lack of a better term heroes I</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.510" end="00:35:15.390" style="s2">mean you know we need there&#39;s increasing</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:16.710" style="s2">research you know you go to Grossman has</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.390" end="00:35:18.540" style="s2">good research and I&#39;ll talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.710" end="00:35:21.450" style="s2">later in this series the Solomon effect</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.540" end="00:35:24.090" style="s2">that if you can move from disgust so you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.450" end="00:35:26.490" style="s2">have a very difficult problem has to do</p>

<p begin="00:35:26.490" end="00:35:28.910" style="s2">people typically describe</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.620" end="00:35:31.910" style="s2">they describe it from the first-person</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.910" end="00:35:33.080" style="s2">perspective if that person read ascribes</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.910" end="00:35:36.200" style="s2">the problem from a third-person</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.080" end="00:35:39.380" style="s2">perspective that often will help them to</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.200" end="00:35:40.940" style="s2">have insight into the problem this lines</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.380" end="00:35:42.380" style="s2">up with some it&#39;s convergent with</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.940" end="00:35:44.090" style="s2">evidence from the Berlin paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.380" end="00:35:45.830" style="s2">studying of wisdom that if when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.090" end="00:35:49.610" style="s2">trying to solve a wisdom task you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.830" end="00:35:53.900" style="s2">imagine talking to someone else that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.610" end="00:35:55.760" style="s2">will help you to to better solve the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.900" end="00:35:57.680" style="s2">problem and of course all those things</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.760" end="00:35:59.840" style="s2">both line up with the fact that we we</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.680" end="00:36:03.140" style="s2">improve our own metacognitive ability by</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.840" end="00:36:05.300" style="s2">internalizing the perspective other</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.140" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">people have on us so Leo Ferraro</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.300" end="00:36:10.040" style="s2">and I argued that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:12.830" style="s2">seems to be across many different wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.040" end="00:36:14.890" style="s2">traditions is the trains perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.830" end="00:36:17.390" style="s2">knowing to bring about these</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.890" end="00:36:19.790" style="s2">improvements in our capacity for insight</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.390" end="00:36:21.950" style="s2">and solving the problems that are most</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.790" end="00:36:23.900" style="s2">pertinent to us is a process of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.950" end="00:36:27.050" style="s2">internalizing this age we we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.900" end="00:36:29.180" style="s2">find figures who are wiser than us that</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.050" end="00:36:31.400" style="s2">we can imitate and emulate the way a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.180" end="00:36:32.870" style="s2">child imitates an adult and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.400" end="00:36:35.510" style="s2">problematic I&#39;ll come back to this up</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.870" end="00:36:40.250" style="s2">but analogous to that so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.510" end="00:36:42.680" style="s2">develop these skills of reflective</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.250" end="00:36:46.520" style="s2">metacognition that will improve the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.680" end="00:36:49.480" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom now of course that</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.520" end="00:36:51.590" style="s2">is problematic because an adult child</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.480" end="00:36:53.060" style="s2">relationship is not the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.590" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">relationship that should exist between</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.060" end="00:36:56.930" style="s2">adults and that&#39;s where the sport</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">psychology has also been valuable</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.930" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2">because the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:04.220" style="s2">coach and the athlete is also an analogy</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.150" end="00:37:06.110" style="s2">I would use you can see that the athlete</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.220" end="00:37:08.510" style="s2">often has to go through this process of</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.110" end="00:37:11.320" style="s2">internalizing the coach and what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.510" end="00:37:14.030" style="s2">looks like and in order to you know to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.320" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">translate you know the knowledge into</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.030" end="00:37:17.570" style="s2">the perspective of knowing into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:20.510" style="s2">procedural and purchase the procedural</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.570" end="00:37:23.150" style="s2">skills and participatory transformation</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.510" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">of their of who they are in order to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.150" end="00:37:28.160" style="s2">become the kind of athlete they want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:30.890" style="s2">become so that gives us another sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.160" end="00:37:32.840" style="s2">way of thinking about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.890" end="00:37:34.970" style="s2">there&#39;s you know when it&#39;s done properly</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.840" end="00:37:37.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a teacher-student relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.970" end="00:37:40.930" style="s2">so if we can try and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.870" end="00:37:42.970" style="s2">you know use many different models the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.930" end="00:37:49.180" style="s2">hope is that we could come up with a way</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.970" end="00:37:53.320" style="s2">of finding these people in a beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.180" end="00:37:54.790" style="s2">fashion Jensen Kim has one of my former</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.320" end="00:37:57.700" style="s2">students and current colleagues has done</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.790" end="00:38:00.730" style="s2">research within wisdom traditions and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.700" end="00:38:03.850" style="s2">many people have many instances of very</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.730" end="00:38:06.430" style="s2">positive role models for their</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.850" end="00:38:10.060" style="s2">cultivation of wisdom so that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.430" end="00:38:11.800" style="s2">prevalent thing that all being said this</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.060" end="00:38:14.190" style="s2">is precisely why we need what I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.800" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">mentioning earlier we need some co-op</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.190" end="00:38:21.490" style="s2">non-hierarchical but co-opt organization</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:23.190" style="s2">that&#39;s mutually self-correcting mutually</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.490" end="00:38:26.800" style="s2">supporting for trying to vet</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.190" end="00:38:29.590" style="s2">institutions and individuals in some</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:32.020" style="s2">sort of way and also that you know a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.590" end="00:38:33.250" style="s2">curriculum a shared curriculum it could</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.020" end="00:38:35.500" style="s2">be diverse it doesn&#39;t have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.250" end="00:38:39.130" style="s2">monolithic but shown vetted shared</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.500" end="00:38:45.060" style="s2">curriculum precisely to address the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.130" end="00:38:47.020" style="s2">possibility of you know you know abuse</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.060" end="00:38:51.250" style="s2">and I think the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.020" end="00:38:53.620" style="s2">individuals can cultivate their skills</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.250" end="00:39:05.680" style="s2">in the ways that I&#39;ve suggested may help</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.620" end="00:39:07.300" style="s2">with that process so someone a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.680" end="00:39:09.430" style="s2">has here has advancements in machine</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.300" end="00:39:11.320" style="s2">learning cars because any revision to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.430" end="00:39:12.390" style="s2">your thesis the naturalistic imperative</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.320" end="00:39:16.270" style="s2">is unattainable</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.390" end="00:39:17.980" style="s2">so that&#39;s literally my PhD thesis about</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.270" end="00:39:19.410" style="s2">the naturalistic imperative and if</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.980" end="00:39:22.390" style="s2">somebody went out and read that</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.410" end="00:39:26.140" style="s2">congratulations you&#39;re that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.390" end="00:39:28.690" style="s2">that&#39;s very that&#39;s then that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.140" end="00:39:31.600" style="s2">shows a real commitment to trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.690" end="00:39:33.610" style="s2">understand something yes the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.600" end="00:39:35.050" style="s2">that is yes and so my more recent</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.610" end="00:39:36.310" style="s2">publications especially work that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.050" end="00:39:36.850" style="s2">done with him willow craft Blake</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.310" end="00:39:39.220" style="s2">Richards</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.850" end="00:39:41.590" style="s2">leo Ferraro and others have pointed to</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.220" end="00:39:44.230" style="s2">the fact that these advancements I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.590" end="00:39:47.770" style="s2">have changed my mind towards the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.230" end="00:39:49.810" style="s2">possibility of solving the naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.770" end="00:39:51.150" style="s2">imperative precisely because the work</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.810" end="00:39:53.130" style="s2">that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.150" end="00:39:55.559" style="s2">with one of you know like Tim is one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.130" end="00:39:57.719" style="s2">the Tim level-cap is one of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.559" end="00:40:02.160" style="s2">stars of you know the work on machine</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.719" end="00:40:03.809" style="s2">learning and and both Tim and Blake were</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.160" end="00:40:05.160" style="s2">two co-authors with me on the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.809" end="00:40:08.759" style="s2">realization paper the point I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.160" end="00:40:10.410" style="s2">to make is that I think the the advances</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.759" end="00:40:12.529" style="s2">in machine learning can give us some of</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.410" end="00:40:15.809" style="s2">the theoretical tools for talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.529" end="00:40:18.749" style="s2">an explanation of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.809" end="00:40:21.390" style="s2">that&#39;s now in publication in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.749" end="00:40:23.160" style="s2">machine learning and I think and as I</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.390" end="00:40:27.599" style="s2">argued in my thesis that was the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.160" end="00:40:29.640" style="s2">that was sort of resisting attaining a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.599" end="00:40:32.579" style="s2">satisfy a satisfactory account of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.640" end="00:40:35.670" style="s2">naturalistic a satisfactory solution to</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.579" end="00:40:38.039" style="s2">the naturalistic imperative so yes it</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.670" end="00:40:40.049" style="s2">has definitely changed it and I invite</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.039" end="00:40:41.339" style="s2">you to go out and seek some of those</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.049" end="00:40:45.450" style="s2">publications and you can see how the</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.339" end="00:40:46.380" style="s2">change works okay so I&#39;m now going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.450" end="00:40:49.019" style="s2">try and move to some of the live</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.380" end="00:40:52.559" style="s2">questions I I&#39;ll do my best to get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.019" end="00:40:55.710" style="s2">all of them but I apologize if I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.559" end="00:40:57.989" style="s2">once again for somebody like myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.710" end="00:41:01.729" style="s2">who&#39;s very socially phobic and who finds</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.989" end="00:41:04.859" style="s2">this kind of putting myself out there</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.729" end="00:41:07.229" style="s2">for lack of a better phrase deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.859" end="00:41:09.059" style="s2">challenging huh very stressful for me</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.229" end="00:41:12.089" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of balding my ear right now in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.059" end="00:41:14.670" style="s2">fact I&#39;m deeply appreciative of the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.089" end="00:41:16.979" style="s2">that and people of course welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.670" end="00:41:18.509" style="s2">disagree with me I&#39;m deeply appreciative</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.979" end="00:41:22.380" style="s2">of fact that people are supportive</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.940" end="00:41:41.910" style="s2">event is there a response depends what</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.249" end="00:41:44.009" style="s2">you mean I mean I use a model upon to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.910" end="00:41:46.910" style="s2">turn the the lived body is not present</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.009" end="00:41:48.989" style="s2">in the pure consciousness event because</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.910" end="00:41:51.229" style="s2">because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense in</p>

<p begin="00:42:14.480" end="00:42:17.150" style="s2">this is this is something really really</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.130" end="00:42:19.520" style="s2">crucial I think it&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.390" end="00:42:47.780" style="s2">what the flow phenomena I think shows is</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.170" end="00:42:50.530" style="s2">that you can lose your ego precisely in</p>

<p begin="00:44:24.440" end="00:44:30.830" style="s2">important and so I imagine there&#39;s huge</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.830" end="00:44:35.600" style="s2">shifting of processing we know that</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.100" end="00:44:42.140" style="s2">sense I think there&#39;s major probably</p>

<p begin="00:44:43.700" end="00:44:51.380" style="s2">during the pure consciousness event it</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.250" end="00:44:52.910" style="s2">seems to it seems like an episode 19 you</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.380" end="00:44:54.530" style="s2">said that Augustine philosophy was</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.910" end="00:44:55.730" style="s2">beautiful and maybe even complete does</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.530" end="00:45:00.320" style="s2">this mean that we need to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.730" end="00:45:05.320" style="s2">Augustine&#39;s philosophy in some way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.320" end="00:45:08.900" style="s2">I I did think that Augustine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.320" end="00:45:13.870" style="s2">philosophy was very beautiful in the way</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.900" end="00:45:17.630" style="s2">that he integrated Christianity and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.870" end="00:45:20.330" style="s2">Latinas and the Aristotelian narrative</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.630" end="00:45:22.070" style="s2">word of via the inquiry the</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.330" end="00:45:24.580" style="s2">incorporation of Platonic because petha</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.070" end="00:45:28.010" style="s2">Latinas had already integrated Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.580" end="00:45:29.930" style="s2">with with Plato so I do think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.010" end="00:45:34.360" style="s2">powerful than that it&#39;s this really</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.930" end="00:45:38.630" style="s2">beautiful admirable articulation of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.360" end="00:45:40.970" style="s2">of the narrative and normative and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.630" end="00:45:43.670" style="s2">neurological orders and as I argued that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.970" end="00:45:47.210" style="s2">seems to line up very clearly with the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.670" end="00:45:49.730" style="s2">way people currently articulate as you</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.210" end="00:45:51.830" style="s2">know scientifically the dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.730" end="00:45:55.100" style="s2">meaning in life the purpose the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.830" end="00:45:57.020" style="s2">narrative order coherence the normal</p>

<p begin="00:45:57.020" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">right the normative order so in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.460" end="00:46:09.890" style="s2">sense that we need to get a worldview</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:14.060" style="s2">that can beautifully articulate the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.890" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">three orders in a way that fits into the</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.060" end="00:46:18.260" style="s2">agent arena relationship of our</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.340" end="00:46:21.950" style="s2">worldview Andrea Ford&#39;s worldview</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.260" end="00:46:23.930" style="s2">attunement then there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.950" end="00:46:29.090" style="s2">that is what we need to do but I do not</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.930" end="00:46:31.610" style="s2">think we can return to Augustine I I</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.090" end="00:46:36.980" style="s2">mean so the the series goes on to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.610" end="00:46:42.080" style="s2">show the history of how the Augustinian</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.980" end="00:46:45.310" style="s2">view was significantly undermined and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.080" end="00:46:48.020" style="s2">that and and not just undermine</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.310" end="00:46:50.090" style="s2">philosophically as I tried to show there</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.020" end="00:46:51.800" style="s2">are the there are there is always the</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.090" end="00:46:53.240" style="s2">creation of new psycho technologies it</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.800" end="00:46:55.310" style="s2">was the invention of new set of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.240" end="00:46:57.680" style="s2">technologies that created the changes in</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.310" end="00:47:00.650" style="s2">consciousness and cognition that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.680" end="00:47:02.980" style="s2">know promoted the two worlds mythology</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.650" end="00:47:06.140" style="s2">that you know came to a kind of fruition</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.980" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">in Augustine but there have been new</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.140" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">psycho technological developments since</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">then and just like we can&#39;t go back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:15.170" style="s2">the Bronze Age before the actual</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.450" style="s2">revolution because we cannot give up the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.170" end="00:47:20.090" style="s2">psycho technologies of literacy and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.450" end="00:47:23.210" style="s2">numeracy and abstract symbolic thought I</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.090" end="00:47:25.670" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.210" end="00:47:27.950" style="s2">Augustinian worldview because we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.670" end="00:47:30.320" style="s2">give up the psycho technologies that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.950" end="00:47:32.870" style="s2">now have like graphing in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.320" end="00:47:35.470" style="s2">method etc etcetera the ones that I up</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.870" end="00:47:40.490" style="s2">the ones that I lay out in this series</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.470" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">so in that sense I don&#39;t think we can we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.490" end="00:47:47.090" style="s2">should or can go back to Augustine I</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:48.320" style="s2">think then I&#39;ve tried to portray this I</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.090" end="00:47:51.370" style="s2">think we should pay Augustine deep</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.320" end="00:47:54.490" style="s2">respect and see what can we salvage from</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.370" end="00:47:57.110" style="s2">that Augustinian view now I know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.490" end="00:47:59.180" style="s2">Jonathan and pesho&#39; and the Paul van der</p>

<p begin="00:47:59.180" end="00:48:04.370" style="s2">that and and I&#39;m happy to discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.180" end="00:48:08.420" style="s2">with them so I&#39;m just giving the reasons</p>

<p begin="00:49:34.089" end="00:49:37.150" style="s2">the difference between artificial</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.170" end="00:49:41.619" style="s2">intelligence and artificial rationality</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.150" end="00:49:44.440" style="s2">in the series so the only area I feel</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.619" end="00:49:47.220" style="s2">competent to address on is that I do</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.440" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">think that the meeting crisis</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.220" end="00:49:52.839" style="s2">exacerbates and interferes with our</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:55.119" style="s2">ability to respond to these other crises</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.839" end="00:49:58.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve made this argument before and so</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.119" end="00:50:01.930" style="s2">I&#39;ll briefly review it the idea is in</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.750" end="00:50:04.410" style="s2">order to answer these kinds of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.930" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">very significant existential threats I</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.410" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">think we have to bring about really</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.829" style="s2">radical transformations and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:14.619" style="s2">consciousness cognition character</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.829" end="00:50:17.260" style="s2">communitas and that&#39;s very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.619" end="00:50:19.809" style="s2">for us because many of us are post</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.260" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">religious and we distrust as some of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.809" end="00:50:24.130" style="s2">people in the lot of questions of</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:28.270" style="s2">showing religious institutions because</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.130" end="00:50:30.579" style="s2">of the history so we can&#39;t make use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.270" end="00:50:32.710" style="s2">the thing that is in the past been</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.579" end="00:50:35.500" style="s2">responsible for bringing about that kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.710" end="00:50:37.450" style="s2">of comprehensive transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.500" end="00:50:39.609" style="s2">threat in the face of serious</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.450" end="00:50:42.130" style="s2">environmental and/or historical change</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.609" end="00:50:44.109" style="s2">and that&#39;s religion so for many of us</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.130" end="00:50:46.779" style="s2">that&#39;s not available to us but we also</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.109" end="00:50:49.079" style="s2">have significant distrust and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.779" end="00:50:51.369" style="s2">secular alternatives political machinery</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.079" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2">political ideological movement pseudo</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.369" end="00:50:56.049" style="s2">religious ideological movements and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:50:57.430" style="s2">distrust those of course because of</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.049" end="00:51:00.569" style="s2">their history and it&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.430" end="00:51:08.349" style="s2">they drench the earth and Titanic blood</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.569" end="00:51:12.819" style="s2">so I do think what I can say is that if</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.349" end="00:51:14.980" style="s2">we do not come up with a significant</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.819" end="00:51:16.270" style="s2">response to the meaning crisis I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.980" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.270" end="00:51:20.530" style="s2">there is reason to believe that will</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:25.569" style="s2">radically increase the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.530" end="00:51:30.069" style="s2">we will succumb to one of these deep</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.569" end="00:51:32.410" style="s2">threats and that is of course one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.069" end="00:51:35.020" style="s2">urgent motivating factors for why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.410" end="00:51:36.790" style="s2">doing all of this and why so many people</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.020" end="00:51:40.089" style="s2">and it is now so many people I&#39;m aware</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.790" end="00:51:42.280" style="s2">of me so many people are trying to bring</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.089" end="00:51:46.690" style="s2">about the changes it of course is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.280" end="00:51:49.420" style="s2">think a very sad state of affairs and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.690" end="00:51:51.460" style="s2">I&#39;m not taking a political side here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.420" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">making a meta political comment it is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.460" end="00:51:56.589" style="s2">very sad state of affairs that the these</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:52:00.040" style="s2">issues and the meaning crisis issue and</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.589" end="00:52:02.710" style="s2">its attendant you know issues of mental</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.040" end="00:52:05.770" style="s2">health and loneliness these are just not</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.710" end="00:52:15.299" style="s2">central concerns in the political arena</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.770" end="00:52:15.299" style="s2">and that that means that means I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.069" end="00:52:22.930" style="s2">isn&#39;t it isn&#39;t it a plausible conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.990" end="00:52:24.760" style="s2">that there is no political solution as</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.930" end="00:52:28.900" style="s2">the police said that it&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.760" end="00:52:33.790" style="s2">to be a cultural solution in some</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.900" end="00:52:35.760" style="s2">powerful way and so that&#39;s the hope is</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.790" end="00:52:40.109" style="s2">that what I see happening culturally</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.760" end="00:52:42.280" style="s2">these groups in these movements will</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.109" end="00:52:44.319" style="s2">well they&#39;ve taken root they will grow</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.280" end="00:52:48.819" style="s2">and flourish and I hope I can help that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.319" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">one one sign of hope is people will good</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.819" end="00:52:54.150" style="s2">evidence they will go through radical</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:56.559" style="s2">transformation they will suffer radical</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.150" end="00:52:59.980" style="s2">diminishment in their standard of living</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.559" end="00:53:02.680" style="s2">and other things if they have good</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.980" end="00:53:06.670" style="s2">confidence that their meaning in life</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.680" end="00:53:09.750" style="s2">will be enhanced so that means we do</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.670" end="00:53:14.310" style="s2">have a motivational engine if we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.750" end="00:53:17.880" style="s2">if this becomes a culture and that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.310" end="00:53:19.800" style="s2">important if then it does have important</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.880" end="00:53:22.080" style="s2">motivational purchase on people because</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.800" end="00:53:26.760" style="s2">if people have good reason to believe</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.080" end="00:53:30.540" style="s2">that they that sacrifices in standard of</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.760" end="00:53:33.330" style="s2">living and etc would would would be</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.540" end="00:53:36.570" style="s2">commensurate with you know increase in</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.330" end="00:53:37.860" style="s2">wisdom and meaning people will there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.570" end="00:53:40.950" style="s2">good reason to believe that people will</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.860" end="00:53:47.910" style="s2">do that so that&#39;s the best I can say</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.950" end="00:53:49.740" style="s2">about that question okay you talked</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.910" end="00:53:51.690" style="s2">about poetry that has a contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.740" end="00:53:54.600" style="s2">meditative aspect to it especially when</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.690" end="00:53:57.470" style="s2">spoken aloud any recommendation fit this</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.600" end="00:54:04.230" style="s2">criteria I think a lot of poetry does</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.470" end="00:54:06.180" style="s2">and and III think I mean there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.230" end="00:54:08.790" style="s2">poetry that is just meant to be recited</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.180" end="00:54:10.650" style="s2">you know I I&#39;m a big fan of EE Cummings</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.790" end="00:54:13.290" style="s2">you know with up so floating mini bells</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.650" end="00:54:16.140" style="s2">down just saying that the musicality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.290" end="00:54:20.450" style="s2">it is just a serious part of the poem</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.140" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">but I mean I find that the musicality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.450" end="00:54:27.840" style="s2">poetry is I find it in in a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:29.430" style="s2">poetry that I read and it just and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.840" end="00:54:32.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened in that in that</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.430" end="00:54:35.940" style="s2">poetry party it just comes out when it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.520" end="00:54:39.240" style="s2">is recited and shared but recitation</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.940" end="00:54:42.210" style="s2">means you know said aloud in the company</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.240" end="00:54:44.600" style="s2">of other people that are giving caring</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.210" end="00:54:47.370" style="s2">attention to it I think a lot of poetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.600" end="00:54:49.470" style="s2">would be improved by that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.370" end="00:54:51.900" style="s2">things I&#39;m going to do I&#39;m in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.470" end="00:54:53.990" style="s2">process of starting to do is just you</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.900" end="00:54:58.950" style="s2">know collect a YouTube playlist of</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.990" end="00:55:01.350" style="s2">poetry that I think is expressive and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.950" end="00:55:03.660" style="s2">reflective and responsive to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.350" end="00:55:07.110" style="s2">crisis and I will I will eventually make</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.660" end="00:55:10.050" style="s2">that available and start adding to it on</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.110" end="00:55:13.020" style="s2">an ongoing basis kind of analogously to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.050" end="00:55:17.970" style="s2">the way I do the book recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.020" end="00:55:19.830" style="s2">the four on Twitter for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.970" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">interested in are responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.830" end="00:55:25.890" style="s2">meeting Chris I have one more question</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:32.820" style="s2">I&#39;ll try and make it a light everyone do</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.890" end="00:55:35.460" style="s2">you like dancing so um that&#39;s that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.820" end="00:55:40.290" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting one so I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.460" end="00:55:45.210" style="s2">highly socially full pic and so in</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.290" end="00:55:47.910" style="s2">general I don&#39;t like dancing and I guess</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.210" end="00:55:50.820" style="s2">this is also sort of generally a feature</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.910" end="00:55:55.020" style="s2">of men we don&#39;t like dancing but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.820" end="00:55:55.650" style="s2">it really exacerbated for me social</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.020" end="00:55:59.880" style="s2">phobia</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.650" end="00:56:03.840" style="s2">now I do like I deeply like isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.880" end="00:56:07.050" style="s2">right verb I deeply appreciate and savor</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.840" end="00:56:11.910" style="s2">the dance like aspects of doing Tai Chi</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.050" end="00:56:16.890" style="s2">Chuan for example or yoga and that leads</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.910" end="00:56:19.860" style="s2">to a funny story my my partner she she</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.890" end="00:56:22.950" style="s2">loves dancing and I&#39;ve gone to a dance</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.860" end="00:56:25.800" style="s2">with her and she&#39;s Persian and so there</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.950" end="00:56:27.390" style="s2">was Persian dancing and it was like at</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.800" end="00:56:29.610" style="s2">first oh no what am I gonna do is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.390" end="00:56:31.470" style="s2">be terrifying but what I found was all I</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.610" end="00:56:33.750" style="s2">had to do was sort of modify some Tai</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.470" end="00:56:35.670" style="s2">Chi movements and postures and I was I</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.750" end="00:56:39.150" style="s2">was able to come off as a passively good</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.670" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">Persian dancer so that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.150" end="00:56:46.290" style="s2">best dance experiences of dancing</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:49.160" style="s2">experiences I&#39;ve ever had in my life so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.290" end="00:56:54.140" style="s2">unfortunately we&#39;re running out of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.160" end="00:56:57.450" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a lot of questions that</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.140" end="00:56:59.400" style="s2">people have sent and and that are still</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.450" end="00:57:02.340" style="s2">coming through I will try and gather</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.660" end="00:57:23.130" style="s2">will try to mention some of these if</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.820" end="00:57:25.950" style="s2">possible when I&#39;m being interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.130" end="00:57:28.290" style="s2">going for four in the future I take</p>
