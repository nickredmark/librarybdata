<p begin="00:00:11.730" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">horse podcast livestream I am sitting</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.519" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">here with dr. Heather huiying as has</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:22.500" style="s2">become our custom and we are about to</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:26.300" style="s2">embark on another exciting discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.500" end="00:00:29.849" style="s2">our global situation we have been</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.300" end="00:00:31.470" style="s2">opening up with Corrections we had some</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.849" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">technical difficulties in the last</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.470" end="00:00:35.489" style="s2">stream which caused us to have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">compile the footage and upload it</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.489" end="00:00:39.090" style="s2">separately which may have gotten in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">way of us registering some things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.090" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">needed correcting or it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">there were fewer Corrections this week</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:48.210" style="s2">but I&#39;m not aware of anything major that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">we said that would require an update are</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.210" end="00:00:54.180" style="s2">you aware of anything no am i alright so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">I do have an update or two that are not</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.180" end="00:00:59.160" style="s2">quite a correction several livestreams</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:01.530" style="s2">ago we talked about the possibility that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.160" end="00:01:03.780" style="s2">was being raised by several doctors on</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.530" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">the front lines of treating Ovid 19</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.780" end="00:01:10.740" style="s2">patients that the the symptomatology</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">looked more like altitude sickness than</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.740" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">it did like a standard viral pneumonia</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve now seen several papers address</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">this question and it is looking less</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">likely that this is high altitude like</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:28.530" style="s2">symptoms and more like standard viral</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">pneumonia now as we covered last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.530" end="00:01:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s possible that different doctors are</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:35.180" style="s2">seeing patients with different symptoms</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.640" end="00:01:37.619" style="s2">and I would also point out that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.180" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">dialogue between doctors about what</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.619" end="00:01:41.720" style="s2">they&#39;re seeing and what its meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:45.270" style="s2">is actually a very healthy thing for</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.720" end="00:01:49.170" style="s2">medicine and that in some sense doctors</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.270" end="00:01:51.000" style="s2">once upon a time were very much more</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.170" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">scientifically oriented in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.000" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">that they had fewer pharmacological</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">tools at their disposal and their</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">greatest tool was their ability to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">analyze patterns that they were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.860" style="s2">and figure out how to treat people</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">individually and maybe among the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.860" end="00:02:10.489" style="s2">positive things that might come out of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">this terrible situation is a rebirth of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.489" end="00:02:14.420" style="s2">Medicine</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:17.240" style="s2">science on the frontlines yeah in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.420" end="00:02:18.920" style="s2">era of Big Pharma diagnostics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.240" end="00:02:21.800" style="s2">hypothesis testing became something</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.920" end="00:02:23.630" style="s2">relegated to a specialist view rather</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.800" end="00:02:27.050" style="s2">than something that all doctors did all</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.630" end="00:02:28.430" style="s2">the time and every ICU doctor and really</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.050" end="00:02:29.900" style="s2">every health care professional who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.430" end="00:02:33.440" style="s2">looking at patients right now is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.900" end="00:02:36.860" style="s2">effectively having to generate and test</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.440" end="00:02:39.350" style="s2">in a you know imperfect way but with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.860" end="00:02:42.020" style="s2">patient&#39;s they&#39;ve got hypotheses about</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.350" end="00:02:45.080" style="s2">what the best course of action is yes so</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.020" end="00:02:47.140" style="s2">that would be a positive thing and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.080" end="00:02:50.630" style="s2">they&#39;ll be a renaissance in old-school</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.140" end="00:02:51.860" style="s2">medicine I&#39;d love to see it let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.630" end="00:02:54.140" style="s2">among the other things that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.860" end="00:02:58.760" style="s2">were worth raising before we get to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.140" end="00:03:01.810" style="s2">the meat of our discussion are I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.760" end="00:03:04.870" style="s2">several reports now that suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.810" end="00:03:07.610" style="s2">the actual infection rate is</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.870" end="00:03:10.160" style="s2">spectacularly high relative to the rate</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.610" end="00:03:12.140" style="s2">of cases that are detected and this wood</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.160" end="00:03:14.540" style="s2">on the one hand it sounds like terrible</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.140" end="00:03:16.880" style="s2">news but it would in fact in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.540" end="00:03:19.400" style="s2">be great news yeah we said that a few a</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.880" end="00:03:21.050" style="s2">few livestreams ago in fact yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.400" end="00:03:24.530" style="s2">what it would mean is that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.050" end="00:03:28.840" style="s2">cases are asymptomatic and so presumably</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.530" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">if one acquires an immunity to the virus</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.840" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">by having an asymptomatic infection then</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.269" end="00:03:36.140" style="s2">it would mean that a large fraction of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:38.450" style="s2">the population has actually encountered</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.140" end="00:03:41.870" style="s2">this thing already and gotten through it</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.450" end="00:03:46.459" style="s2">without a major cost now on the flip</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.870" end="00:03:48.040" style="s2">side I have also as you may have even</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.459" end="00:03:50.330" style="s2">brought it to my attention there was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.040" end="00:03:52.459" style="s2">report that suggested that of South</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.330" end="00:03:54.350" style="s2">Korea I think right out of South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.459" end="00:03:57.950" style="s2">that suggested people may be getting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.350" end="00:04:00.019" style="s2">virus a second time and I must say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.950" end="00:04:01.940" style="s2">very doubtful that this is going to turn</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.019" end="00:04:03.680" style="s2">out to be the pattern there are viruses</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.940" end="00:04:05.810" style="s2">that behave that way but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.680" end="00:04:08.180" style="s2">there&#39;s any reason to expect that here</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.810" end="00:04:11.180" style="s2">and what there is reason to expect is</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.180" end="00:04:13.700" style="s2">that we will definitely see given that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.180" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">there are false positives we will</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.700" end="00:04:17.959" style="s2">definitely see a certain number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:19.970" style="s2">people who have not had the disease who</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.959" end="00:04:21.859" style="s2">test positive and then do get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.970" end="00:04:24.350" style="s2">disease and test positive again and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.859" end="00:04:25.750" style="s2">would look just like a case of somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.350" end="00:04:29.960" style="s2">getting it twice</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.750" end="00:04:31.699" style="s2">so I think we can be certain that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.960" end="00:04:33.770" style="s2">will see that pattern a little even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.699" end="00:04:36.469" style="s2">there is no truth to the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.770" end="00:04:40.819" style="s2">can get the virus a second time I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.469" end="00:04:42.500" style="s2">I mean the the data such as it work that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.819" end="00:04:44.900" style="s2">was cut that was reported on in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.500" end="00:04:47.120" style="s2">very brief article out of South Korea</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.900" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">was scant and very hard to interpret but</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.120" end="00:04:51.319" style="s2">my sense was that it was people who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:53.629" style="s2">sick enough to be identified as as</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.319" end="00:04:57.710" style="s2">patients with koban 19 the first time</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.629" end="00:04:59.930" style="s2">and we&#39;re now sick again so that would</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.710" end="00:05:02.300" style="s2">that would not fit with that possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.930" end="00:05:05.349" style="s2">model that you just know I think it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.300" end="00:05:07.610" style="s2">would because in fact I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.349" end="00:05:11.779" style="s2">unrelated to this particular claim</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.610" end="00:05:14.330" style="s2">another paper suggests that the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.779" end="00:05:15.770" style="s2">of influenza cases and I&#39;ve forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.330" end="00:05:19.189" style="s2">where this study was done but the number</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.770" end="00:05:21.979" style="s2">of influenza cases was too high in</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.189" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">January relative to the progression of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.979" end="00:05:26.990" style="s2">influenza and the conclusion that those</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.939" style="s2">authors drew was that in fact some of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.990" end="00:05:34.490" style="s2">those influenza cases weren&#39;t influenza</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.939" end="00:05:37.099" style="s2">at all they were covered 19 so the cases</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.490" end="00:05:39.560" style="s2">that were diagnosed as kovat 19 may have</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.099" end="00:05:41.900" style="s2">been something like flu that was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.560" end="00:05:45.190" style="s2">serious they got tested for Kovach 19</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.900" end="00:05:49.069" style="s2">got a false positive recovered and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.190" end="00:05:51.169" style="s2">tested for kovat 19 in a second about so</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.069" end="00:05:53.029" style="s2">you would expect some small number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.169" end="00:05:54.529" style="s2">those and the problem is the way and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.029" end="00:05:56.330" style="s2">maybe you know and maybe a high number I</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.529" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">think we won&#39;t do this this time but</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.330" end="00:06:02.719" style="s2">maybe in a future live stream we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">talk about what how false positives will</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.719" end="00:06:06.979" style="s2">give a very wrong sense of what is going</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:08.750" style="s2">on depending on what the base rate of</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.979" end="00:06:11.089" style="s2">infection out there is which we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.750" end="00:06:12.589" style="s2">necessarily know until we start doing a</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.089" end="00:06:16.240" style="s2">lot of testing so there would appear to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.589" end="00:06:19.129" style="s2">be a circular logical problem there yep</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.240" end="00:06:22.490" style="s2">all right good so let&#39;s see I had a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.129" end="00:06:25.180" style="s2">couple other things that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.490" end="00:06:25.180" style="s2">cover Oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.599" end="00:06:32.360" style="s2">also began to see several tests one was</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.629" end="00:06:35.690" style="s2">a test and the other was a meta-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.360" end="00:06:37.789" style="s2">on hydroxychloroquine both of which</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.690" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">suggested it was not effective at</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.789" end="00:06:42.910" style="s2">treating people who</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:44.710" style="s2">admitted to hospital with severe</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.910" end="00:06:46.630" style="s2">symptoms so that doesn&#39;t say it couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.710" end="00:06:49.600" style="s2">do something preventative and nor is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.630" end="00:06:51.070" style="s2">definitive but it&#39;s interesting if so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.600" end="00:06:55.360" style="s2">given that it&#39;s also used only as</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.070" end="00:06:57.400" style="s2">prophylaxis for malaria and actually is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.710" style="s2">chloroquine used as treatment for vivax</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.400" end="00:07:01.630" style="s2">malaria it&#39;s certainly one of it it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.710" end="00:07:03.730" style="s2">certainly is prophylaxis which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.630" end="00:07:05.740" style="s2">you take it in advance of getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.730" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">exposed to malaria in order to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.740" end="00:07:10.090" style="s2">you getting it but I don&#39;t I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:13.480" style="s2">actually remember if chloroquine may</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.090" end="00:07:16.270" style="s2">also be used as treatment if I recall</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.480" end="00:07:17.890" style="s2">correctly back from when we used to</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.270" end="00:07:20.980" style="s2">travel in these places and actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.890" end="00:07:23.820" style="s2">you&#39;ve had a field assistant come down</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.980" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">with malaria yeah in one instance the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.820" end="00:07:31.660" style="s2">treatment for vivax malaria involved a</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:36.490" style="s2">large dose of quinine which is related</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.660" end="00:07:38.620" style="s2">to chloroquine and but when this was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.490" end="00:07:40.870" style="s2">rural northeastern madagascar so what</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.620" end="00:07:42.640" style="s2">the what the treatment there was may not</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.870" end="00:07:43.990" style="s2">at all be the state-of-the-art it may</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.640" end="00:07:46.840" style="s2">just have been what was available right</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.990" end="00:07:51.090" style="s2">but it&#39;s effective um what it doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.840" end="00:07:54.580" style="s2">if I remember correctly is vivax malaria</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.090" end="00:07:56.470" style="s2">retreats to one&#39;s liver and the quinine</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.580" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">apparently does not reach it in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.470" end="00:08:00.610" style="s2">liver and one requires a second drug to</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:02.710" style="s2">chase it out of the liver and I can&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.610" end="00:08:04.210" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what drug it was that</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.710" end="00:08:06.250" style="s2">does that job but if the quinine</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.210" end="00:08:09.310" style="s2">apparently did not did not reach it if</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.250" end="00:08:11.640" style="s2">I&#39;m if I&#39;m remembering accurately so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.310" end="00:08:14.140" style="s2">anyway I guess stay tuned for that story</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.640" end="00:08:16.030" style="s2">both of these things or all of them that</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.140" end="00:08:17.950" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about so far reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.030" end="00:08:20.260" style="s2">what we talked about in the last live</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.950" end="00:08:24.250" style="s2">stream which is that we are now all of</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.260" end="00:08:27.460" style="s2">us who wish to be on the front lines of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.250" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">an active scientific discussion in which</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.460" end="00:08:33.099" style="s2">nobody really knows the score we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">learning as we go along and that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.099" end="00:08:37.450" style="s2">fraught with pitfalls you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:39.729" style="s2">getting to tune in on all of the false</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.450" end="00:08:42.070" style="s2">starts about different things that may</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.729" end="00:08:45.250" style="s2">or may not be true but you&#39;re also there</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.070" end="00:08:47.340" style="s2">to witness the dawning of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.250" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">of how the thing functions and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.340" end="00:08:53.580" style="s2">that really you couldn&#39;t ask for a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:56.070" style="s2">better lesson in science or medicine</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.580" end="00:08:59.370" style="s2">than then being on the front lines of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.070" end="00:09:01.650" style="s2">this one mm-hmm all right so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.370" end="00:09:04.910" style="s2">that&#39;s all of the things I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.650" end="00:09:07.560" style="s2">cover that reflect on prior discussions</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.910" end="00:09:10.440" style="s2">do you want to introduce the first of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.560" end="00:09:12.210" style="s2">our topics for today&#39;s discussion sure I</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.440" end="00:09:14.970" style="s2">think what we&#39;ve called this episode is</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.210" end="00:09:18.300" style="s2">smoking and other essentials which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.970" end="00:09:20.460" style="s2">not quite quite what we actually mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.300" end="00:09:22.290" style="s2">but it was it was maybe enough to garner</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.460" end="00:09:24.860" style="s2">some interest so we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.290" end="00:09:28.200" style="s2">smoking and the apparently contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.860" end="00:09:32.460" style="s2">evidence that is coming out with regard</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.200" end="00:09:34.290" style="s2">to what the effect of smoking has on bad</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.460" end="00:09:37.080" style="s2">outcomes for the guard to cope of 19 and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.290" end="00:09:39.480" style="s2">then also talk about what what makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.080" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">something essential for humans in light</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.480" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">of the kinds of and ways that lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:46.740" style="s2">is happening and services are being shut</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:48.030" style="s2">down in the US which is where we know</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.740" end="00:09:53.520" style="s2">most about it but so let&#39;s start with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.030" end="00:09:54.960" style="s2">smoking shall we so there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.520" end="00:09:57.690" style="s2">a lot of papers out there this is all</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.960" end="00:10:02.310" style="s2">pretty much on the preprint servers as</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.690" end="00:10:04.080" style="s2">we talked about last time that that say</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.310" end="00:10:08.040" style="s2">a variety of things so I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.080" end="00:10:09.450" style="s2">mention three here part of us I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.040" end="00:10:12.270" style="s2">probably mispronouncing the names for</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.450" end="00:10:14.250" style="s2">Davos and Nikki tarah 2020 found that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.270" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">smoking is predictive of worse outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.250" end="00:10:18.780" style="s2">in covent 19 patients they did it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:20.280" style="s2">preliminary meta-analysis which means</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.780" end="00:10:21.990" style="s2">that they went and looked at other</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.280" end="00:10:24.630" style="s2">published papers most of which were in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.990" end="00:10:26.970" style="s2">preprint stage as well and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.630" end="00:10:28.110" style="s2">initially found in this case 71 studies</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.970" end="00:10:30.420" style="s2">that they thought they could use they</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.110" end="00:10:32.130" style="s2">went out at 2 5 on the basis of whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.420" end="00:10:33.810" style="s2">or not those studies actually had</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.130" end="00:10:35.580" style="s2">evidence about you know people in kovin</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.810" end="00:10:40.020" style="s2">19 and all of the things that one might</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.580" end="00:10:42.870" style="s2">need to winnow it to and by then doing a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.020" end="00:10:45.270" style="s2">again a meta-analysis of those five</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.870" end="00:10:51.150" style="s2">pieces of published research they found</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.270" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">that only one of them had mmm I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.150" end="00:10:58.260" style="s2">typo in here they found weak positive</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:59.680" style="s2">association between smoking and worse</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.260" end="00:11:02.459" style="s2">outcomes for kovin 19</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.680" end="00:11:04.509" style="s2">but they concluded that there is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.459" end="00:11:08.439" style="s2">there is a neater correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.509" end="00:11:10.749" style="s2">smoking and bad outcomes Lippe and Henry</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.439" end="00:11:13.660" style="s2">did another preliminary meta-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.749" end="00:11:15.790" style="s2">using different search search terms in</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.660" end="00:11:18.279" style="s2">slightly different in slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.790" end="00:11:20.910" style="s2">databases and they initially found 27</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.279" end="00:11:25.179" style="s2">studies they wintered it also to 5 and</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.910" end="00:11:27.339" style="s2">they find effectively no association</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.179" end="00:11:30.189" style="s2">whatsoever but when you look at these</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.339" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">two meta analyses side by side you find</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.189" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">that ok they both were actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:36.160" style="s2">at 5 different papers and as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.949" style="s2">out for the papers in their two cases</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.160" end="00:11:40.899" style="s2">for exactly the same so the statistics</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.949" end="00:11:43.389" style="s2">that they&#39;re using which are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.899" end="00:11:45.490" style="s2">black box for almost anyone even people</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.389" end="00:11:47.649" style="s2">who are fairly savvy in statistics is</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.490" end="00:11:49.809" style="s2">where all the you know where all the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.649" end="00:11:53.410" style="s2">magic or you know in magic is happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.809" end="00:11:56.379" style="s2">and they came to quite different</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.410" end="00:11:59.139" style="s2">conclusions based on meta analyses of</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.379" end="00:12:00.790" style="s2">four of the same five papers between the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.139" end="00:12:08.980" style="s2">two of them so that tells you something</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.790" end="00:12:10.779" style="s2">about what what kind of numeracy sorcery</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.980" end="00:12:12.339" style="s2">is going on and so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.779" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">interesting stuff happens a minute but</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.339" end="00:12:15.100" style="s2">did you know something to add there well</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:16.870" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot to say first we</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.100" end="00:12:18.850" style="s2">should probably say for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.870" end="00:12:20.829" style="s2">aren&#39;t familiar with the term</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.850" end="00:12:23.439" style="s2">meta-analysis what it really means is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.829" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">analysis of analyses so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.439" end="00:12:27.970" style="s2">that you have a bunch of papers that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.910" end="00:12:31.050" style="s2">disagree on some point somebody can</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.970" end="00:12:34.689" style="s2">analyze them and there may be reasons to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.050" end="00:12:36.939" style="s2">discount you know if all the papers that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.689" end="00:12:38.889" style="s2">say one thing happened in the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.939" end="00:12:41.129" style="s2">location and that population might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.889" end="00:12:44.920" style="s2">anomalous you might discover that if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.129" end="00:12:47.079" style="s2">you know if you throw out that data that</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.920" end="00:12:48.910" style="s2">the pattern becomes very consistent or</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.079" end="00:12:50.769" style="s2">something like that but a meta-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.910" end="00:12:53.850" style="s2">is an important thing to do when you</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.769" end="00:12:56.019" style="s2">have a complex phenomenon and the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.850" end="00:12:58.869" style="s2">the conclusions go in different</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.019" end="00:13:00.990" style="s2">directions so well and in this case they</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.869" end="00:13:02.529" style="s2">weren&#39;t they weren&#39;t looking for</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.990" end="00:13:03.939" style="s2">conclusions that went in different</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.529" end="00:13:07.389" style="s2">directions they were just looking for</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.939" end="00:13:10.540" style="s2">all cases all published papers on Kovan</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.389" end="00:13:12.339" style="s2">19 that had that said that included any</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.540" end="00:13:13.030" style="s2">information at all as to the smoking</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.030" end="00:13:17.260" style="s2">right that was just that was what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.470" end="00:13:19.930" style="s2">were looking for so there I mean still</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.260" end="00:13:23.230" style="s2">it amounts to the same thing if you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.930" end="00:13:25.710" style="s2">an expert in such a field you would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.230" end="00:13:27.910" style="s2">faced with the fact that there were</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.040" end="00:13:41.020" style="s2">figure out why the pattern is not</p>

<p begin="00:13:41.020" end="00:13:46.990" style="s2">you pool the data and and ask a question</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.990" end="00:13:51.190" style="s2">this is an essential art but what</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.490" end="00:13:54.550" style="s2">Heather is saying is that it is fraught</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.190" end="00:13:56.950" style="s2">with dangers because it is inherent that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.550" end="00:13:59.050" style="s2">the methodologies will differ and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.950" end="00:14:01.840" style="s2">figuring out how to compile the data so</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.050" end="00:14:04.870" style="s2">that it tells a coherent story even</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.840" end="00:14:06.640" style="s2">harder now when everyone who&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.870" end="00:14:08.650" style="s2">this work is working so hard they</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.640" end="00:14:10.330" style="s2">probably are not eager to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.650" end="00:14:12.970" style="s2">requests to you know just supply me your</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.330" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">entire data set so they&#39;re comparing</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:17.589" style="s2">they&#39;re comparing the publications</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">really they&#39;re not necessarily even able</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.589" end="00:14:21.280" style="s2">to go and look at the original data sets</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:24.130" style="s2">which means that there are whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.280" end="00:14:25.750" style="s2">biases are in you know in data set one</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.130" end="00:14:28.030" style="s2">two three four or five are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.750" end="00:14:29.110" style="s2">different are not going to be visible we</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.160" end="00:14:41.950" style="s2">meta-analysis and it&#39;s just much harder</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.290" end="00:14:43.930" style="s2">to assess where the errors might be than</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.950" end="00:14:46.120" style="s2">in a non meta analysis but it has the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.930" end="00:14:48.670" style="s2">opportunity to potentially reveal bigger</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.120" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">patterns right and this is a I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.670" end="00:14:54.220" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s like fieldwork for data</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:56.380" style="s2">if you go into the field you&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.220" end="00:14:58.360" style="s2">with a chaotic environment that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:15:03.100" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">identify a pattern worth pursuing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.860" end="00:15:10.060" style="s2">part of the art of fieldwork in this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:12.400" style="s2">case the noise is in the different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.060" end="00:15:15.640" style="s2">of data interacting and the different</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.400" end="00:15:18.070" style="s2">you know labs that have biases to them</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.640" end="00:15:22.150" style="s2">and figuring out what&#39;s worth pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.070" end="00:15:25.120" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s at least as much art as</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.150" end="00:15:26.590" style="s2">science and trying to make it rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.120" end="00:15:28.600" style="s2">requires sharing</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.590" end="00:15:31.300" style="s2">methodology this is another place we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.600" end="00:15:33.490" style="s2">having this done out in the open with</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.300" end="00:15:36.160" style="s2">all of us amateurs with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.490" end="00:15:39.010" style="s2">epidemiology able to tune in and you</p>

<p begin="00:15:41.650" end="00:15:47.020" style="s2">that that helps because it allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.530" end="00:15:48.610" style="s2">spot errors that you know an</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.020" end="00:15:50.860" style="s2">epidemiologist may not be an</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.860" end="00:15:54.700" style="s2">evolutionary perspective might allow you</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.170" end="00:15:56.290" style="s2">to rule out certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.700" end="00:16:00.130" style="s2">explanations and cause you to focus</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.290" end="00:16:02.770" style="s2">elsewhere we can bring it to bear so</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.130" end="00:16:04.900" style="s2">good I think it&#39;s all quite positive now</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.770" end="00:16:07.960" style="s2">the question though is what might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.900" end="00:16:10.360" style="s2">going on with the smoking we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.960" end="00:16:13.480" style="s2">gotten to the major part of the meat of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.360" end="00:16:15.220" style="s2">it yet what I will say is that those two</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.480" end="00:16:17.140" style="s2">which I just said something about are</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.220" end="00:16:20.280" style="s2">two of many actually there have been</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.140" end="00:16:23.590" style="s2">both many individually published</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.280" end="00:16:25.630" style="s2">pre-printed papers and several meta meta</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.590" end="00:16:27.610" style="s2">analyses already and and articles</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.630" end="00:16:29.260" style="s2">calling themselves review articles which</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.610" end="00:16:31.030" style="s2">basically I think the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.260" end="00:16:32.920" style="s2">between a review a review article and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.030" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">meta-analysis is that a review article</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.920" end="00:16:38.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t inherently try to do the fancy</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:41.110" style="s2">statistics on the the competent cognate</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.440" end="00:16:43.420" style="s2">Oryx of the analyses that they&#39;re citing</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.110" end="00:16:46.510" style="s2">I would say view article is just saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.420" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">okay here&#39;s here&#39;s what I see from all</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.510" end="00:16:52.600" style="s2">of these different lines of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:54.700" style="s2">review article does not have a method a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.600" end="00:16:56.950" style="s2">review article reports what has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.700" end="00:16:59.410" style="s2">found even if it disbelieves some part</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.950" end="00:17:01.980" style="s2">it may say that but it basically says</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.410" end="00:17:04.840" style="s2">here&#39;s the state of what we know so far</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.980" end="00:17:06.580" style="s2">whereas a meta-analysis actually goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.840" end="00:17:09.880" style="s2">about trying to integrate these things</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.580" end="00:17:11.680" style="s2">into an emergent yeah good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.880" end="00:17:14.709" style="s2">empirical yeah yeah every vertical is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.680" end="00:17:16.870" style="s2">known as American mm-hmm so in either of</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.709" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">those two review of those two</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.870" end="00:17:21.040" style="s2">meta-analysis that I just mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:22.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t their attempt to look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.040" end="00:17:24.459" style="s2">background rates of smoking in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.360" end="00:17:27.840" style="s2">populations from which the patients came</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.459" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">so they are effectively comparing</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.840" end="00:17:32.830" style="s2">outcomes of patients that have that have</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:38.530" style="s2">been hospitalized and saying you do</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.830" end="00:17:40.570" style="s2">smokers or non-smokers do better but far</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.530" end="00:17:41.980" style="s2">cellino&#39;s at all 2020 and Saeki</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.570" end="00:17:44.049" style="s2">you did have that you could pull that up</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.980" end="00:17:50.470" style="s2">now and if you don&#39;t that&#39;s fine just</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.049" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">let me know so this is a paper cool that</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.470" end="00:17:56.440" style="s2">came out on it&#39;s a very new server it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:18:00.789" style="s2">like it&#39;s like a new kind of open-source</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.440" end="00:18:03.220" style="s2">I think it is the moment acting is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.789" end="00:18:04.840" style="s2">preprint server but it could become both</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.220" end="00:18:06.159" style="s2">a preprint and a post print as it were</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.840" end="00:18:11.830" style="s2">server it&#39;s something I&#39;d never heard of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.159" end="00:18:15.399" style="s2">before today oh okay sorry we can see it</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.830" end="00:18:18.190" style="s2">but but you guys can&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.399" end="00:18:23.590" style="s2">as of April 14th it&#39;s in pre print</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.190" end="00:18:25.539" style="s2">version 13 and it&#39;s and some of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.539" end="00:18:31.659" style="s2">version 13 are adding new reviews to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.299" end="00:18:33.250" style="s2">their to their meta analysis and you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.659" end="00:18:35.169" style="s2">see now it&#39;s it&#39;s up on the screen it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.250" end="00:18:37.090" style="s2">smoking vaping and hospitalization for</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.169" end="00:18:38.860" style="s2">kovat 19 I&#39;ll just jump to one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.090" end="00:18:40.360" style="s2">one of the conclusions which is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.860" end="00:18:41.799" style="s2">because there are literally no data on</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.360" end="00:18:44.820" style="s2">vaping they have nothing to say about</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.799" end="00:18:46.870" style="s2">vaping so I&#39;m not sure why that got</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.820" end="00:18:47.860" style="s2">ranked is so important to end up in the</p>

<p begin="00:18:47.860" end="00:18:52.690" style="s2">anything to say about it let me talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.590" end="00:18:54.700" style="s2">first for a moment about something</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.690" end="00:18:57.539" style="s2">that&#39;s not that interesting I think from</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.700" end="00:19:00.070" style="s2">from what we can what we can add here</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.539" end="00:19:01.480" style="s2">and you can maybe take it down whenever</p>

<p begin="00:23:44.040" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">fascinating some of which would tell</p>

<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:54.820" style="s2">not going to be the case but let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.090" end="00:23:56.950" style="s2">for example that people who smoked had a</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.820" end="00:24:00.880" style="s2">high chance of dropping dead within</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.950" end="00:24:02.140" style="s2">hours of contracting Tsarskoe - they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.880" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">less likely to end up in hospital yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.140" end="00:24:04.870" style="s2">they don&#39;t end up in the hospital lo and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">behold it looks like it&#39;s protective and</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.870" end="00:24:08.740" style="s2">it is in its own way it&#39;s protective of</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:10.059" style="s2">ending up in hospitals you don&#39;t live it</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.740" end="00:24:11.410" style="s2">to get to getting there but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.059" end="00:24:13.090" style="s2">bracket that with this isn&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.410" end="00:24:15.160" style="s2">end up being true it&#39;s very unlikely to</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.090" end="00:24:16.990" style="s2">be true although I will say you know my</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.160" end="00:24:18.279" style="s2">favorite stuff is often the things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.990" end="00:24:19.690" style="s2">seem really really unlike</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.279" end="00:24:21.460" style="s2">but I have some reason to think they</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.690" end="00:24:23.139" style="s2">probably are right and one of them I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.460" end="00:24:25.090" style="s2">gonna pat myself on the back here</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.139" end="00:24:28.539" style="s2">potentially which is I have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.090" end="00:24:32.109" style="s2">forever that as terrible as smoking is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.539" end="00:24:34.239" style="s2">for you it will turn out to be a mixed</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.109" end="00:24:36.369" style="s2">bag in the end now I&#39;m not a smoker</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.239" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">you&#39;re not a smoker but the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.369" end="00:24:40.599" style="s2">said that was because you had</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:44.739" style="s2">populations of Native Americans with a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.599" end="00:24:46.840" style="s2">long history of smoking tobacco and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.739" end="00:24:48.940" style="s2">passes what we would call the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.840" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">test which makes it a presumptive</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.940" end="00:24:54.339" style="s2">adaptation we&#39;re it true that it were</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:55.749" style="s2">simply bad those populations that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.339" end="00:24:58.419" style="s2">do it would have an advantage and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.749" end="00:25:00.460" style="s2">would see the behavior go extinct so I</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.419" end="00:25:02.409" style="s2">mean there&#39;s there&#39;s also for with</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.460" end="00:25:05.080" style="s2">regard to Native American traditions it</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.409" end="00:25:09.190" style="s2">often is smoking tobacco but separating</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:31.089" style="s2">although I hesitate to say that out loud</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.080" end="00:25:33.609" style="s2">but these are these are different things</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.669" end="00:26:21.070" style="s2">the marijuana that people smoke now</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.889" end="00:26:26.169" style="s2">versus even even just in the 80s even</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.070" end="00:26:29.169" style="s2">just before 60 70s 80s before there was</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.169" end="00:26:31.839" style="s2">such financial pressure to make it heavy</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.169" end="00:26:32.230" style="s2">to melt to make it dense and small and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.839" end="00:26:34.690" style="s2">pack</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.230" end="00:26:36.179" style="s2">also across borders yeah marijuana</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.690" end="00:26:38.470" style="s2">you&#39;re too kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.179" end="00:26:42.190" style="s2">Wow that was terrible all right I</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.470" end="00:26:46.630" style="s2">apologize for it but but in any case it</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.190" end="00:26:49.720" style="s2">is likely that merit that tobacco in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.630" end="00:26:52.450" style="s2">ancestral context has a net positive</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.720" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">effect for populations that smoked it it</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.450" end="00:26:57.010" style="s2">is likely that that has been disrupted</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:58.120" style="s2">by the way tobacco is now currently</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.010" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">delivered but even in the current</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.120" end="00:27:04.120" style="s2">context I believe there is some evidence</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:06.580" style="s2">that in cases of Parkinson&#39;s it has some</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.120" end="00:27:09.940" style="s2">sort of positive effect and I also</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.580" end="00:27:12.669" style="s2">remember years ago when we were reading</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.940" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">and teaching the emperor of sent about</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.669" end="00:27:17.530" style="s2">luca turin and his model for how</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:22.870" style="s2">olfaction functions terrific book</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.530" end="00:27:26.070" style="s2">excellent book yeah there was a question</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.870" end="00:27:28.990" style="s2">this luca turn is one of the world&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.070" end="00:27:31.390" style="s2">leading experts on smell not only how it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.990" end="00:27:34.179" style="s2">functions but in the art of describing</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.390" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">smell he has written perfume guides for</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.179" end="00:27:37.960" style="s2">example that our world renowned and they</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:40.510" style="s2">too are exquisite like his writing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.960" end="00:27:42.700" style="s2">unlike what most people have to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.510" end="00:27:45.880" style="s2">about perfume and smells if nothing else</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.700" end="00:27:47.410" style="s2">reading this book will cause you to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.880" end="00:27:48.970" style="s2">a completely different relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.410" end="00:27:50.919" style="s2">the way things smell and even if you had</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.970" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">never had any interest in perfumes</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.919" end="00:27:55.330" style="s2">you&#39;ll find yourself going to seek them</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:58.510" style="s2">out and trying to identify what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.330" end="00:28:00.250" style="s2">various notes are but anyway Luca Turin</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.510" end="00:28:02.549" style="s2">at least when that book was written was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.250" end="00:28:05.080" style="s2">a smoker and he was often asked how</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.549" end="00:28:07.780" style="s2">could you possibly be you&#39;re destroying</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.080" end="00:28:10.120" style="s2">your olfactory sense and it turned out</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.780" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">that no in fact if anything it went the</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.120" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">other way</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:15.040" style="s2">it had a heightening effect so so let me</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.000" end="00:28:16.840" style="s2">just say I tried I went down this rabbit</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.040" end="00:28:19.419" style="s2">hole just a tiny bit today I went</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.840" end="00:28:23.470" style="s2">looking for you know I&#39;ve I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.419" end="00:28:26.440" style="s2">that smoking increases people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.470" end="00:28:28.630" style="s2">taste and that often chefs are smokers</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.440" end="00:28:30.040" style="s2">and I can find nothing in the published</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.630" end="00:28:32.260" style="s2">literature just just from you know a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.040" end="00:28:34.780" style="s2">half an hour of looking today but</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.260" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">certainly you know this is anecdotally</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.780" end="00:28:38.530" style="s2">we&#39;ve heard this report from you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">people with masterful noses and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.530" end="00:28:42.970" style="s2">masterful senses of taste and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.950" style="s2">that the literature isn&#39;t bearing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.970" end="00:28:46.480" style="s2">out at least so far as I could find it</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.950" end="00:28:51.130" style="s2">does not inherently mean it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.480" end="00:28:52.420" style="s2">yep now I also did read I wish I</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.130" end="00:28:54.400" style="s2">remember where it was but I did read</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.420" end="00:28:56.260" style="s2">somebody it&#39;s just a conjecture but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.400" end="00:28:59.530" style="s2">somebody was going down the various</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.260" end="00:29:03.220" style="s2">paths of how the lack of smokers of</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.530" end="00:29:06.130" style="s2">current smokers to meet the expectations</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.220" end="00:29:09.250" style="s2">in hospital could possibly be explained</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.130" end="00:29:12.490" style="s2">and one of the things that was offered</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.250" end="00:29:14.140" style="s2">as a possibility was that smoking was</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.490" end="00:29:15.880" style="s2">effectively keeping people at a distance</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.140" end="00:29:18.220" style="s2">from you therefore reducing your</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.880" end="00:29:21.400" style="s2">likelihood of contracting it so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.220" end="00:29:22.990" style="s2">there are you know probably thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.400" end="00:29:24.910" style="s2">different ways that this could interact</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.990" end="00:29:27.070" style="s2">other than being physiologically</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.910" end="00:29:29.050" style="s2">protective but certainly physiological</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.070" end="00:29:32.740" style="s2">protective physiologically protective is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.050" end="00:29:34.330" style="s2">one possibility and it might it might be</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.740" end="00:29:36.760" style="s2">obscured you know the the first minute</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.330" end="00:29:39.070" style="s2">an LSE is I pointed to you which one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.760" end="00:29:41.170" style="s2">which found you know maybe mild support</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.070" end="00:29:44.020" style="s2">for the idea that smoking is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.170" end="00:29:45.940" style="s2">risk factor which we&#39;ve seen elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.020" end="00:29:48.850" style="s2">and you know again I&#39;m not sure how</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.940" end="00:29:51.130" style="s2">seriously to take that result but we</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.850" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">know that smoking is associated with</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.130" end="00:29:57.550" style="s2">other issues that are comorbidities for</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:58.690" style="s2">kovat 19 so if you&#39;re a long-term smoker</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.550" end="00:30:00.450" style="s2">and therefore you have lung damage</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.690" end="00:30:03.730" style="s2">and/or</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.450" end="00:30:06.790" style="s2">COPD you may well be at greater risk for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.730" end="00:30:08.560" style="s2">Kovan 19 even if either the nicotine or</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.790" end="00:30:09.880" style="s2">somehow the smoking and you know were</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.560" end="00:30:12.490" style="s2">going to remain agnostic as to what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.880" end="00:30:14.770" style="s2">mechanism there is even if smoking</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.490" end="00:30:17.140" style="s2">nicotine is giving you some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.770" end="00:30:19.480" style="s2">protection the other effects of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.140" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">smoking may outweigh the benefits that</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.480" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">may obtain yep this this goes to what we</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:27.430" style="s2">discussed in our last livestream about</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:30.700" style="s2">non-mutually exclusive hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.430" end="00:30:33.040" style="s2">this is going to be if you are new to</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.700" end="00:30:36.040" style="s2">biology this is a very frequent case</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.040" end="00:30:38.680" style="s2">because biology is above all else</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.040" end="00:30:40.720" style="s2">complex and that means you&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.680" end="00:30:42.520" style="s2">dealing with a bunch of factors that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.720" end="00:30:45.400" style="s2">pull in different directions and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.520" end="00:30:47.530" style="s2">know you may see the top factor and rule</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.400" end="00:30:49.300" style="s2">out the others falsely and anyway you</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.530" end="00:30:52.530" style="s2">get down the list to some very subtle</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.300" end="00:30:54.400" style="s2">stuff if you pay attention long enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.530" end="00:30:56.830" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s an interesting set of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.400" end="00:30:57.730" style="s2">questions indeed well that&#39;s what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.830" end="00:31:00.350" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.730" end="00:31:02.930" style="s2">smoking for the moment so let&#39;s see from</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.350" end="00:31:05.900" style="s2">the point of view of advice we can say</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.930" end="00:31:07.490" style="s2">well to give advice no I&#39;m smoking</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.900" end="00:31:09.470" style="s2">tobacco at the moment here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.490" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">first of all if we&#39;re not saying you</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.470" end="00:31:12.980" style="s2">should take up smoking but if you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:16.220" style="s2">going to you probably have time to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.980" end="00:31:18.560" style="s2">now that you&#39;re in lockdown but it makes</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.220" end="00:31:20.450" style="s2">more sense from a medical perspective if</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.560" end="00:31:22.400" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take up smoking to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.450" end="00:31:25.820" style="s2">in China because you&#39;re less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.400" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">end up in the hospital that is some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.820" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">the worst advice I have heard you give</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:33.590" style="s2">today all right I feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:36.830" style="s2">getting something okay so we also wanted</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.590" end="00:31:39.370" style="s2">to talk about what what an essential</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.830" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">item is all right so this is in light of</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.370" end="00:31:44.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked a number of times here on</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:49.070" style="s2">the livestream about the shutting down</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.120" end="00:31:52.550" style="s2">of nature areas the 85 miles span of the</p>

<p begin="00:32:10.340" end="00:32:17.240" style="s2">know we we&#39;ve talked about the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.500" end="00:32:20.060" style="s2">desirability and potentially the need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.240" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">get out into nature a fair bit</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.019" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">presumably go on to die of it will not</p>

<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:44.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t go to the store because they knew</p>

<p begin="00:35:59.140" end="00:36:06.430" style="s2">businesses differently so is it fair</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.430" end="00:36:10.720" style="s2">Costco is open since they sell a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.069" end="00:36:13.720" style="s2">amount of stuff that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.720" end="00:36:16.299" style="s2">resemblance to food and then I can go</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.720" end="00:36:19.480" style="s2">buy a TV while I&#39;m there but if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.299" end="00:36:22.210" style="s2">a mom-and-pop TV store down the road</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.480" end="00:36:23.650" style="s2">they&#39;re closed because we&#39;ve got a lock</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.210" end="00:36:27.460" style="s2">down and they don&#39;t sell any food that</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.650" end="00:36:30.430" style="s2">is unfairly favoring the Costco style</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.460" end="00:36:32.470" style="s2">store and not the mom-and-pop place and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.430" end="00:36:35.019" style="s2">may get people in the habit who were not</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.470" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">already in the habit of shopping at</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.019" end="00:36:41.410" style="s2">Costco for their televisions of just</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:43.779" style="s2">figuring it&#39;s the one one-stop shopping</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.410" end="00:36:45.400" style="s2">place and it further takes the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.779" end="00:36:47.140" style="s2">mom-and-pop and small businesses stores</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.400" end="00:36:49.749" style="s2">out of business once we&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.140" end="00:36:51.430" style="s2">lockdown right so I think we&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.749" end="00:36:52.960" style="s2">pretty good job of steel Manning this</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.430" end="00:36:54.999" style="s2">one those seem like two really good</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.960" end="00:36:57.549" style="s2">arguments see them you know we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.999" end="00:36:59.650" style="s2">we&#39;re defending mom and pop and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.549" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">preventing people from dying by hey</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.650" end="00:37:03.670" style="s2">we&#39;re saving mom and pop and the economy</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:06.339" style="s2">right I mean to that look look at how</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.670" end="00:37:09.519" style="s2">good that is so now let&#39;s get to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.339" end="00:37:13.509" style="s2">wrong with this policy so much so much</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.519" end="00:37:16.920" style="s2">so much so I will say one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.509" end="00:37:20.069" style="s2">about this pandemic is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.920" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">simultaneously demonstrating the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.069" end="00:37:25.119" style="s2">insanity of libertarianism and it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:27.190" style="s2">also driving many of us in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.119" end="00:37:29.529" style="s2">direction based on the horror of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:31.450" style="s2">being deployed on our behalf and because</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.529" end="00:37:33.010" style="s2">of how bad government is how bad</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.450" end="00:37:35.740" style="s2">government is when it went</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.010" end="00:37:37.570" style="s2">poorly which is frequently and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.740" end="00:37:40.600" style="s2">not to say that it has to be done poorly</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.570" end="00:37:43.330" style="s2">no it doesn&#39;t but in this case the idea</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.600" end="00:37:45.550" style="s2">of limiting sales only to essential</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.330" end="00:37:47.650" style="s2">items it&#39;s not the worst idea I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.550" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">heard but it&#39;s definitely in the top ten</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.650" end="00:37:55.810" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really bad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.359" end="00:37:57.550" style="s2">it&#39;s not quite as high as Joe Biden it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.810" end="00:38:02.230" style="s2">the right guy to beat Donald Trump but</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.550" end="00:38:04.540" style="s2">it&#39;s close just leave that one there</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.230" end="00:38:08.859" style="s2">I&#39;ll feel the political blowback from it</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.540" end="00:38:12.820" style="s2">but anyway the problem is the whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.859" end="00:38:16.030" style="s2">of knowing what an essential item is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.820" end="00:38:17.560" style="s2">preposterous on its face it presupposes</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.030" end="00:38:19.390" style="s2">that the people defining what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.560" end="00:38:22.060" style="s2">essential have a really good grip on</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.390" end="00:38:24.100" style="s2">what humans are and what we need so</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.060" end="00:38:25.540" style="s2">since I&#39;ve heard about this policy I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.100" end="00:38:27.430" style="s2">been playing a little game with myself</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.540" end="00:38:29.770" style="s2">where I come up with an item that</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.430" end="00:38:32.740" style="s2">presumably is not essential and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.770" end="00:38:34.150" style="s2">within 14 seconds figure out how I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.740" end="00:38:35.410" style="s2">make a pretty good argument that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.150" end="00:38:36.910" style="s2">might be essential and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.410" end="00:38:39.310" style="s2">pretty much everything&#39;s on the list</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.910" end="00:38:42.070" style="s2">because you know if we were just</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.310" end="00:38:43.810" style="s2">machines and we needed a certain number</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.070" end="00:38:45.790" style="s2">of things to keep us running and we</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.810" end="00:38:49.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a psychology associated with</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.790" end="00:38:50.440" style="s2">them then for awhile for short term you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.000" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">could define the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.440" end="00:38:55.080" style="s2">these things but given that none of us</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.910" style="s2">know how long lockdown is going to last</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.080" end="00:39:00.040" style="s2">we have a psychology that has to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.910" end="00:39:02.350" style="s2">maintained that is now being confronted</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.040" end="00:39:04.690" style="s2">with this very frightening fact of a</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.500" end="00:39:43.240" style="s2">centers plant nurseries or paint yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.810" end="00:39:44.830" style="s2">now on the one hand not essential I mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.240" end="00:39:46.700" style="s2">you do need some flooring but by and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.830" end="00:39:49.130" style="s2">large most places that you would renter</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.700" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">I have it installed I actually wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.130" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">we might not just go back and tell an</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:55.579" style="s2">anecdote from our own lives here and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:39:59.320" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t this doesn&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.579" end="00:40:02.119" style="s2">essentials but when we lived in Michigan</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.320" end="00:40:02.690" style="s2">we had a little house that was very</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.119" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">sweet</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.690" end="00:40:06.740" style="s2">we were in grad school there and at one</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:10.280" style="s2">point so you were in the field you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.740" end="00:40:11.869" style="s2">in Panama for 18 months and during that</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.280" end="00:40:13.310" style="s2">time I came down and acted you should</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.869" end="00:40:15.650" style="s2">feel the system for a couple months and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.310" end="00:40:18.140" style="s2">you had before you went that come to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.650" end="00:40:19.369" style="s2">Madagascar I guess afterwards tell me</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.140" end="00:40:24.230" style="s2">man and ask her with me on one of my</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.369" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">field seasons but I was there alone for</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.230" end="00:40:27.890" style="s2">a few months between coming back up from</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:28.220" style="s2">Panama and before actually we got</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.890" end="00:40:31.430" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.220" end="00:40:32.630" style="s2">this would&#39;ve been 98 and we had the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.430" end="00:40:35.150" style="s2">most wonderful neighbors in the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.630" end="00:40:37.070" style="s2">Tom and Sue McGuire and Tom McGuire was</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.150" end="00:40:40.070" style="s2">a flooring guy by trade so he did he</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.070" end="00:40:44.839" style="s2">installed carpet and tile and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.070" end="00:40:46.460" style="s2">for our wedding I would have our</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.839" end="00:40:50.210" style="s2">solarium tile they&#39;ve had these you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.460" end="00:40:51.619" style="s2">cheesy stick on linoleum tiles and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.210" end="00:40:54.260" style="s2">were grad students we didn&#39;t have much</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.619" end="00:40:58.880" style="s2">money and I wanted to learn how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.260" end="00:41:01.099" style="s2">anyway so I hired Tom to do the work and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.880" end="00:41:05.000" style="s2">to have me as his apprentice so that I</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.099" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">could learn how to tile tile floor and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.000" end="00:41:10.460" style="s2">did it and then we together</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:13.190" style="s2">tiled I think my parents front patio a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.460" end="00:41:15.770" style="s2">few years later and you now had the</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.190" end="00:41:17.329" style="s2">skill and since then you I&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.770" end="00:41:19.250" style="s2">little bit more but you&#39;ve done a</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.329" end="00:41:22.250" style="s2">tremendous amount of both wood flooring</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.250" end="00:41:25.700" style="s2">and and tiling and I&#39;ve done some as</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.250" end="00:41:28.369" style="s2">well and you know I don&#39;t know at what</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.700" end="00:41:31.099" style="s2">point you call it essential but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.369" end="00:41:32.690" style="s2">those are skills that we have that allow</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.099" end="00:41:35.420" style="s2">us to be more self-sufficient than we</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.690" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">would be absent them that bring pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.420" end="00:41:40.369" style="s2">that allow us to affect the aesthetic of</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:42.920" style="s2">our home and our environment and be</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.369" end="00:41:48.530" style="s2">creative and be productive and increase</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.920" end="00:41:50.420" style="s2">the value of our homes and so much of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.530" end="00:41:52.400" style="s2">what is available to people right now is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.420" end="00:41:55.220" style="s2">shut off just like you said so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.400" end="00:41:57.230" style="s2">let&#39;s make the argument cleanly all</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.220" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">right on the one hand flooring seems</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.230" end="00:42:01.460" style="s2">non-essential on the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:03.260" style="s2">people many of whom are facing a</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.460" end="00:42:06.380" style="s2">frightening situation with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.260" end="00:42:09.650" style="s2">their employment what they have is time</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.380" end="00:42:12.050" style="s2">and their home to the extent that they</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.650" end="00:42:14.600" style="s2">can upgrade their home with that time</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.050" end="00:42:17.390" style="s2">that is at least some sort of a hedge</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.600" end="00:42:19.430" style="s2">against the situation of having lost</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.390" end="00:42:20.900" style="s2">their job and potentially medical</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.430" end="00:42:24.770" style="s2">insurance the value of their home could</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.900" end="00:42:27.530" style="s2">go up it entertains the mind it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.770" end="00:42:30.230" style="s2">skill so it you know it can be</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.530" end="00:42:32.750" style="s2">contemplative it can be educational it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.230" end="00:42:33.770" style="s2">something people can participate in with</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.750" end="00:42:34.970" style="s2">their kids</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.770" end="00:42:39.470" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.970" end="00:42:41.630" style="s2">during the lockdown outside you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.470" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve done a bunch of gardening I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.630" end="00:42:48.290" style="s2">done some some landscaping we&#39;ve brought</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:49.910" style="s2">our kids into it and the fact is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.290" end="00:42:52.010" style="s2">think we have a problem with our</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.910" end="00:42:53.450" style="s2">psychological health here in part</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.010" end="00:42:54.800" style="s2">because even though things are very</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.450" end="00:42:59.210" style="s2">definitely not normal</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.800" end="00:43:00.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to do and it feels ok but</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.210" end="00:43:03.370" style="s2">we also have a much better situation</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.740" end="00:43:05.780" style="s2">than most people you know we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.370" end="00:43:08.020" style="s2">cheek-by-jowl with our neighbors and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.780" end="00:43:12.740" style="s2">we&#39;re not stuck at an apartment building</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.020" end="00:43:15.050" style="s2">so anyway for people who I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.740" end="00:43:17.030" style="s2">basic point is I can&#39;t tell you whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.050" end="00:43:20.150" style="s2">flooring is essential for you or not but</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.030" end="00:43:21.980" style="s2">I would easily entertain an argument in</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.150" end="00:43:26.150" style="s2">many circumstances that it could be</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.980" end="00:43:28.010" style="s2">essential in in in many people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.150" end="00:43:30.140" style="s2">at this point just a simple fact of</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.010" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">something productive to do rather than</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.140" end="00:43:34.460" style="s2">dwell on the frightening situation yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:38.030" style="s2">that we find ourselves in changing your</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.460" end="00:43:39.830" style="s2">environment for the better for some in</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.030" end="00:43:42.620" style="s2">some way that feels better to you that</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.830" end="00:43:45.170" style="s2">has increased the value of of your home</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.620" end="00:43:46.880" style="s2">and giving providing a project for</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.170" end="00:43:49.460" style="s2">finding you something to see change in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.880" end="00:43:51.230" style="s2">over that I mean cut it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.460" end="00:43:54.770" style="s2">increasingly hard to figure out what day</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.230" end="00:43:58.250" style="s2">of the week it is and this is true I</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.770" end="00:44:00.170" style="s2">think across many sectors maybe not all</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.250" end="00:44:01.730" style="s2">but you know the people on the front</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.170" end="00:44:04.430" style="s2">lines who are you know who the health</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.730" end="00:44:05.840" style="s2">care workers may have that problem for</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.430" end="00:44:09.170" style="s2">the inverse reason the days are running</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.840" end="00:44:12.710" style="s2">together because they&#39;re always at work</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.170" end="00:44:15.740" style="s2">but for those of us who are working</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.710" end="00:44:17.530" style="s2">you know whose kids are doing remote</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.740" end="00:44:20.300" style="s2">schooling and we&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.530" end="00:44:22.970" style="s2">pretending to keep this Monday through</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.300" end="00:44:24.380" style="s2">Friday work schedule not really like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.970" end="00:44:26.210" style="s2">don&#39;t I haven&#39;t heard from anyone like</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:28.670" style="s2">yeah they totaled it that&#39;s working it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.210" end="00:44:30.109" style="s2">it totally feels normal and I get up at</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.670" end="00:44:32.210" style="s2">the same time that I always would have</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.109" end="00:44:34.520" style="s2">been on a Tuesday and I&#39;m going to bed</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.210" end="00:44:36.500" style="s2">at the same time no you know those</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.520" end="00:44:41.660" style="s2">things are beginning to to tatter and</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.500" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">fray and being able to either do work of</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.660" end="00:44:45.950" style="s2">the sort that you already have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:47.300" style="s2">skills and or potentially learn some</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.950" end="00:44:49.460" style="s2">kind of skill that you didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.300" end="00:44:52.390" style="s2">before while really working hard to stay</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.460" end="00:44:55.520" style="s2">out of the hospital seems like an</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.390" end="00:44:59.150" style="s2">extraordinary way and a potentially easy</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.520" end="00:45:01.430" style="s2">and cheap way for governments to allow</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.150" end="00:45:05.540" style="s2">for this not to be a massive</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.430" end="00:45:07.490" style="s2">psychological death as well yeah I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.540" end="00:45:09.109" style="s2">say it is an interesting exercise try</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.490" end="00:45:12.230" style="s2">for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.109" end="00:45:15.710" style="s2">naming a product something you might buy</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.230" end="00:45:17.270" style="s2">and take whatever list you think it</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.710" end="00:45:18.410" style="s2">normally belongs on and see if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.270" end="00:45:21.260" style="s2">make an argument for the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.410" end="00:45:23.510" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s pet food essential yeah as</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.260" end="00:45:24.770" style="s2">pets aren&#39;t unless you think they are I</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.510" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">mean that&#39;s the problem is we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.770" end="00:45:28.520" style="s2">going to agree pet food is is essential</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:31.250" style="s2">because so many people have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.520" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">relationship with their pet that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.250" end="00:45:38.359" style="s2">unthinkable that you would view it any</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:40.490" style="s2">other way but the fact is even even if</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.359" end="00:45:44.230" style="s2">you don&#39;t like pets even if you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.490" end="00:45:46.790" style="s2">that people who have pets are ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.230" end="00:45:50.480" style="s2">you have to know that those of us with</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.790" end="00:45:51.589" style="s2">pets if you take pet food offline we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.480" end="00:45:53.180" style="s2">not going to just stop feeding our pets</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.589" end="00:45:55.430" style="s2">we&#39;re going to start feeding our pets</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.180" end="00:45:57.619" style="s2">human food which causes more of a</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.430" end="00:45:59.869" style="s2">problem with the supply chain for human</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.619" end="00:46:02.180" style="s2">food yeah it&#39;s far better to allow us to</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.869" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">continue to feed our pets yeah people</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.180" end="00:46:05.150" style="s2">will feed their pets regardless and in</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:07.099" style="s2">this case I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.150" end="00:46:08.630" style="s2">danger at all of people making the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.099" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">choice on this but the point is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.630" end="00:46:15.230" style="s2">an aesthetic call and so much of it is I</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:18.740" style="s2">mean this podcast itself is functioning</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.230" end="00:46:23.480" style="s2">on the basis largely of materials that I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.740" end="00:46:26.599" style="s2">mean and all of this came late at night</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.480" end="00:46:28.339" style="s2">yeah Zach and I late at night</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.599" end="00:46:30.380" style="s2">to Home Depot there was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.339" end="00:46:31.549" style="s2">nobody there and we just sourced</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.380" end="00:46:32.869" style="s2">everything we would need because we</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.549" end="00:46:37.099" style="s2">didn&#39;t know what kind of lockdown was</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.869" end="00:46:39.769" style="s2">coming this is right before Governor</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.099" end="00:46:41.569" style="s2">Brown put the lockdown order in place so</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.769" end="00:46:44.119" style="s2">as it turns out Home Depot and Lowe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.569" end="00:46:45.950" style="s2">and even the smaller hardware stores are</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.119" end="00:46:47.390" style="s2">open just with much restricted hours but</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.950" end="00:46:48.650" style="s2">you were going there they were closing</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.390" end="00:46:51.229" style="s2">like at 10:00 or 11:00</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.650" end="00:46:53.059" style="s2">yeah so you&#39;d go until closing bring the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.229" end="00:46:54.890" style="s2">stuff back then go to the office to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.059" end="00:46:56.059" style="s2">dismantle it to get the equipment but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.890" end="00:46:58.279" style="s2">mean the thing is you could make the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.059" end="00:47:00.859" style="s2">argument this is not essential right</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.279" end="00:47:03.559" style="s2">frankly even if you thought the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.859" end="00:47:06.200" style="s2">was somehow important we could do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.559" end="00:47:08.569" style="s2">with you know the camera that&#39;s on our</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.200" end="00:47:09.140" style="s2">laptops and you know sitting in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.569" end="00:47:11.359" style="s2">corner</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.140" end="00:47:13.160" style="s2">so was any of this essential well I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.359" end="00:47:15.829" style="s2">don&#39;t know because it has some effect on</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.160" end="00:47:17.509" style="s2">how other people are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.829" end="00:47:19.549" style="s2">lockdown there a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.509" end="00:47:21.470" style="s2">finding that they take solace in these</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.549" end="00:47:24.349" style="s2">discussions and hearing what rational</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.470" end="00:47:26.329" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know any better than</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.349" end="00:47:28.729" style="s2">you all what&#39;s going on but maybe have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.329" end="00:47:31.009" style="s2">some tools to sort it out so and that in</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.729" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">turn provides us Seles so you know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.009" end="00:47:38.059" style="s2">goes both ways and the places that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:39.559" style="s2">find solace are not obvious in part</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.059" end="00:47:41.630" style="s2">because we are not machines which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.559" end="00:47:46.430" style="s2">where you started right so all I would</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.630" end="00:47:49.190" style="s2">say is I don&#39;t I think the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.430" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">can take a list of products and decide</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.190" end="00:47:54.140" style="s2">whether they are essential is</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:47:56.539" style="s2">preposterous on its face right and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.140" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">literally try it for yourself take a</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.539" end="00:48:01.039" style="s2">product and then make an argument for</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:03.229" style="s2">make an argument against and now imagine</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.039" end="00:48:05.989" style="s2">bureaucrats deciding this for you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.229" end="00:48:09.950" style="s2">an obscene kind of an exercise what</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.989" end="00:48:12.229" style="s2">needs to happen is we need to be armed</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.950" end="00:48:15.229" style="s2">with good information about how this</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.229" end="00:48:17.509" style="s2">thing is transmitted you know so that we</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.229" end="00:48:21.049" style="s2">can make judgments we also have to build</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.509" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">a system that doesn&#39;t externalize the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.049" end="00:48:26.049" style="s2">harm in other words what we</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">evolutionists especially people who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.049" end="00:48:34.400" style="s2">well-versed in human evolution know is</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">that systems of reputation exist in</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.400" end="00:48:40.230" style="s2">order to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:42.390" style="s2">well being so in other words to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.230" end="00:48:43.920" style="s2">extent that if you&#39;re sick and you go</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.390" end="00:48:45.690" style="s2">out you&#39;re gonna get other people sick</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.920" end="00:48:48.570" style="s2">but you&#39;re not necessarily going to make</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.690" end="00:48:51.300" style="s2">your own situation worse that has to in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.570" end="00:48:53.340" style="s2">some sense be viewed as unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.300" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">behavior you know like not washing your</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.340" end="00:48:58.320" style="s2">hands after you go to the bathroom right</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:49:01.110" style="s2">this is viewed dimly for good reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.320" end="00:49:03.300" style="s2">because the harm to your reputation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.110" end="00:49:05.940" style="s2">being seen you know leaving the bathroom</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.300" end="00:49:07.650" style="s2">without washing your hands is enough to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.940" end="00:49:09.660" style="s2">inspire people to wash their hands who</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.650" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">might not otherwise do it so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.660" end="00:49:15.900" style="s2">have that kind of reputation accost for</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:17.670" style="s2">behaving badly and then you need to have</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.900" end="00:49:20.910" style="s2">discretion to say actually you know what</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.670" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">in this case this object which might be</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.910" end="00:49:24.780" style="s2">not essential in some other context is</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:26.460" style="s2">essential enough that it&#39;s worth it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.780" end="00:49:29.870" style="s2">here&#39;s how I&#39;m going to minimize the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.460" end="00:49:32.570" style="s2">risk that I am involved in creating a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.870" end="00:49:34.830" style="s2">epidemiological hazard for anybody else</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.570" end="00:49:37.890" style="s2">right and that is doable with</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.830" end="00:49:39.660" style="s2">information but this again requires that</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.890" end="00:49:41.070" style="s2">people develop models of what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.660" end="00:49:43.470" style="s2">risks are and where they&#39;re coming from</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.070" end="00:49:47.580" style="s2">as opposed to receiving a list of do&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.470" end="00:49:51.090" style="s2">and don&#39;ts yeah the the the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.580" end="00:49:53.750" style="s2">that you can do this by algorithm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.090" end="00:49:57.240" style="s2">going to be effectively automated is</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.750" end="00:49:58.710" style="s2">nonsense and that is not to say that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.240" end="00:50:00.840" style="s2">there should not be a line between</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.710" end="00:50:02.910" style="s2">essential and not essential but it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.840" end="00:50:05.670" style="s2">say that you can&#39;t you can&#39;t put the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.910" end="00:50:09.270" style="s2">object on a list and say what its nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.670" end="00:50:11.420" style="s2">is it just won&#39;t work yeah I guess one</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.270" end="00:50:15.540" style="s2">other thing with regard to essential</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.420" end="00:50:18.840" style="s2">very quickly live entertainment was shut</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.540" end="00:50:20.850" style="s2">down so we had tickets both to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.840" end="00:50:22.440" style="s2">armory here Portland center stage to</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.850" end="00:50:25.140" style="s2">some theater and to Oregon Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.440" end="00:50:27.360" style="s2">Festival down in Ashland both of which</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.140" end="00:50:29.670" style="s2">we are well for Oregon Shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.360" end="00:50:32.700" style="s2">Festival long term you know more than a</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.670" end="00:50:35.340" style="s2">decade we&#39;ve been going there most</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.700" end="00:50:38.060" style="s2">summers in Portland Center stations</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.340" end="00:50:41.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve lived here live theatre is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.060" end="00:50:45.450" style="s2">fabulous fabulous joy of being human for</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.550" end="00:50:47.100" style="s2">those of us who do enjoy it and it yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.450" end="00:50:50.220" style="s2">it would appear to be non-essential with</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.100" end="00:50:50.789" style="s2">regard to you don&#39;t die within six</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.220" end="00:50:53.699" style="s2">months if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.789" end="00:50:55.679" style="s2">don&#39;t get to see live theater but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.699" end="00:50:58.890" style="s2">would say that the reason that they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.679" end="00:51:00.749" style="s2">shutdown was not for their non-essential</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.890" end="00:51:03.660" style="s2">nature it&#39;s because what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.749" end="00:51:05.999" style="s2">in order to enjoy live theater puts you</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.660" end="00:51:08.759" style="s2">and everyone at risk right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.999" end="00:51:13.199" style="s2">this again a conflation of is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.759" end="00:51:19.009" style="s2">activity itself dangerous and is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.199" end="00:51:22.859" style="s2">activity itself actually valuable and</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.009" end="00:51:24.660" style="s2">value necessity essential these have an</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.859" end="00:51:28.019" style="s2">interplay that are going to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.660" end="00:51:30.839" style="s2">hard to define and no one is going to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.019" end="00:51:33.630" style="s2">argue that live theater should rank</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.839" end="00:51:37.109" style="s2">above say grocery stores in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.630" end="00:51:39.959" style="s2">their ability to to run but the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.109" end="00:51:43.289" style="s2">that they closed which was you know we</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.959" end="00:51:45.779" style="s2">saw coming and were disappointed but we</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.289" end="00:51:48.539" style="s2">knew it was going to happen should not</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.779" end="00:51:51.929" style="s2">be read as an indication that the people</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.539" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">behind those those theater groups are</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.929" end="00:51:58.439" style="s2">not doing great services to humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">providing not just beauty but truth in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.439" end="00:52:06.569" style="s2">artistic form to humans yeah and I say</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:09.109" style="s2">another one of these silver linings is</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.569" end="00:52:12.539" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen quite a number of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.109" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">begin to innovate substitutes for things</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.539" end="00:52:18.599" style="s2">like theater using the online tools that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:20.640" style="s2">we have and you know have never really</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.599" end="00:52:24.059" style="s2">been a great fit for civilization when</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.640" end="00:52:25.739" style="s2">it&#39;s humming along but in this case lots</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.059" end="00:52:28.679" style="s2">of things are conceivable that could be</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.739" end="00:52:29.880" style="s2">done remotely that maybe it would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.679" end="00:52:32.969" style="s2">better if you were sitting there but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.880" end="00:52:35.339" style="s2">given that the the demand side is very</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.969" end="00:52:39.089" style="s2">high because people have more time and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.339" end="00:52:41.039" style="s2">less ability to choose what to do so</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.089" end="00:52:42.209" style="s2">anyway there&#39;s a lot of room there for</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.039" end="00:52:44.959" style="s2">people to figure out how to do these</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.209" end="00:52:49.439" style="s2">things you and I have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.959" end="00:52:50.909" style="s2">offering lectures in biology to</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.439" end="00:52:52.709" style="s2">institutions that are suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.909" end="00:52:55.909" style="s2">scrambling to figure out what to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.709" end="00:52:59.789" style="s2">where they&#39;ve promised online content to</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.909" end="00:53:02.920" style="s2">students but they&#39;re not practiced in it</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.789" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">and so anyway we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.920" end="00:53:08.140" style="s2">explored the possibility that we should</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:11.230" style="s2">be offering those lectures and if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.140" end="00:53:14.620" style="s2">are interested in such a thing then</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.230" end="00:53:19.450" style="s2">please contact us at support at Brett</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.620" end="00:53:22.720" style="s2">Weinstein net brett has won t alright so</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.450" end="00:53:25.570" style="s2">I there was one other outgrowth of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.720" end="00:53:27.910" style="s2">discussion that I wanted to cover there</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.570" end="00:53:31.540" style="s2">more that you had yeah so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.910" end="00:53:34.870" style="s2">talk a little bit about the what I see</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.540" end="00:53:39.700" style="s2">as the looming game-theoretic crisis</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.870" end="00:53:43.570" style="s2">that we I believe are about to face the</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.700" end="00:53:46.990" style="s2">fact is we don&#39;t have a national policy</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.570" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">of only essential items being for sale</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.990" end="00:53:51.880" style="s2">what we have is one state exploring it</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:55.390" style="s2">several states well several states</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.880" end="00:53:58.090" style="s2">Michigan was the one you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.390" end="00:54:00.990" style="s2">raises a question let&#39;s say that there</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.090" end="00:54:03.430" style="s2">was some smart way to impose this policy</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.990" end="00:54:06.970" style="s2">which I don&#39;t think there is but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.430" end="00:54:09.850" style="s2">say that there was and then some state</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.970" end="00:54:11.620" style="s2">like Michigan implements it and it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.850" end="00:54:14.260" style="s2">becomes better to live in some other</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.620" end="00:54:17.830" style="s2">state because it didn&#39;t implement it so</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.260" end="00:54:20.350" style="s2">the epidemiology favors the policy but</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.830" end="00:54:21.580" style="s2">those who live elsewhere have an</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.350" end="00:54:22.930" style="s2">advantage and that they can source</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.580" end="00:54:25.030" style="s2">whatever they want and there would be</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.930" end="00:54:26.980" style="s2">competitors in Michigan let&#39;s say are</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.030" end="00:54:32.470" style="s2">sidelined by the inability to source</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.980" end="00:54:35.860" style="s2">materials so that creates a asymmetric</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.470" end="00:54:38.850" style="s2">competition between states which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.860" end="00:54:42.550" style="s2">likely to result in the economic</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.850" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">realities dominating the epidemiological</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.550" end="00:54:48.910" style="s2">realities the reason I raise this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">that we have a question that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.910" end="00:54:55.270" style="s2">now hearing the the the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.690" end="00:54:57.310" style="s2">which is well when does this end when</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.270" end="00:54:59.560" style="s2">does this end is really two different</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.310" end="00:55:05.350" style="s2">questions when do you think we will have</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.560" end="00:55:07.530" style="s2">the response to the epidemic that would</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.350" end="00:55:09.880" style="s2">justify ending the lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.530" end="00:55:11.380" style="s2">that&#39;s one conversation we can have but</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.880" end="00:55:13.120" style="s2">there&#39;s another conversation which seems</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.380" end="00:55:16.300" style="s2">to be brewing right alongside it which</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.120" end="00:55:19.360" style="s2">is at what point do we realize</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.300" end="00:55:21.490" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a strategy for declaring</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.360" end="00:55:23.230" style="s2">an end to the lockdown because maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.490" end="00:55:25.500" style="s2">vaccine if that&#39;s what we&#39;re depending</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.230" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">on might be a year or two down the road</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.500" end="00:55:30.310" style="s2">are we gonna live like this or are we</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.060" style="s2">just going to decide to bite the bullet</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.310" end="00:55:35.620" style="s2">and move forward and my fear is that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.060" end="00:55:39.790" style="s2">discussion about biting the bullet and</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.620" end="00:55:43.030" style="s2">moving forward is really it will be had</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.790" end="00:55:46.180" style="s2">in terms that are not completely honest</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.030" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">it will be had in terms that justify it</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.180" end="00:55:51.280" style="s2">that say now is the time it&#39;s safe</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:54.130" style="s2">enough whether or not it is and that in</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.280" end="00:55:57.880" style="s2">effect what we would be doing if we</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.130" end="00:56:02.110" style="s2">decided to go back to normal is we would</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.880" end="00:56:04.210" style="s2">be rationalizing something I mean it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.110" end="00:56:08.590" style="s2">loose parallel but you know we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.210" end="00:56:11.410" style="s2">heard tales of Inuit for example putting</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.590" end="00:56:14.800" style="s2">elders on ice floes now what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.410" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">know is that this behavior did exist it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.800" end="00:56:21.970" style="s2">was only ever deployed in very severe</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:25.000" style="s2">circumstances like famine and the logic</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.970" end="00:56:27.040" style="s2">behind it is kind of obvious which is if</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:33.130" style="s2">you live in circumstances as harsh as</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.040" end="00:56:35.710" style="s2">the Inuit faced then elders are all well</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.130" end="00:56:37.360" style="s2">and good when there&#39;s enough to go</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.710" end="00:56:39.430" style="s2">around but that there are times when</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.360" end="00:56:42.310" style="s2">things are so severe with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.430" end="00:56:44.230" style="s2">member of the quantity of resources that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.310" end="00:56:49.260" style="s2">a very difficult decision that most of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.230" end="00:56:52.630" style="s2">us never need to contemplate becomes</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.260" end="00:56:57.850" style="s2">manifest in a life-and-death form so my</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.630" end="00:56:58.930" style="s2">point is I am concerned about a rush to</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.850" end="00:57:01.570" style="s2">normalcy</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.930" end="00:57:04.540" style="s2">based on economic considerations which</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.570" end="00:57:10.110" style="s2">are very real that will in effect have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.540" end="00:57:13.600" style="s2">massive consequence for well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.110" end="00:57:16.450" style="s2">the most vulnerable people in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.600" end="00:57:19.000" style="s2">society those who you know homeless</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.450" end="00:57:22.950" style="s2">can&#39;t control their infections based on</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.000" end="00:57:25.810" style="s2">their living conditions the elderly are</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.950" end="00:57:28.760" style="s2">physiologically vulnerable people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.810" end="00:57:30.440" style="s2">live in dense circumstances because of X</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.760" end="00:57:32.590" style="s2">I&#39;m a card ship all of these groups</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.440" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">would pay the price for that choice but</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.590" end="00:57:41.060" style="s2">the game theory will in my opinion be</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:45.350" style="s2">very unlikely to support the choice of</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.060" end="00:57:48.740" style="s2">the Y&#39;s municipalities states nations</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.350" end="00:57:50.600" style="s2">that resist this urge that is to say to</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.740" end="00:57:53.600" style="s2">the extent that somebody decides to</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.600" end="00:57:56.540" style="s2">rationalize relaxing these lockdown</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.600" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">standards they will be economically</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.540" end="00:58:02.260" style="s2">rewarded and what we will have is a race</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:06.650" style="s2">to the bottom where people rush to join</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.260" end="00:58:08.750" style="s2">the what will look like an economic boom</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.650" end="00:58:11.600" style="s2">for whatever part of the world starts</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.750" end="00:58:15.310" style="s2">back up and I think we would be very</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.600" end="00:58:18.040" style="s2">wise to prepare ourselves for that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.310" end="00:58:22.220" style="s2">totally foreseeable game-theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.040" end="00:58:23.990" style="s2">catastrophe so that we don&#39;t go down</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.220" end="00:58:26.810" style="s2">that road because at the moment what we</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.990" end="00:58:29.600" style="s2">have is a situation where because the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.810" end="00:58:31.850" style="s2">whole world is offline all at once</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.600" end="00:58:34.430" style="s2">nobody&#39;s advancing now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.850" end="00:58:36.500" style="s2">perfectly true as we talked about Costco</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.430" end="00:58:38.540" style="s2">has certain advantages over the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.500" end="00:58:42.170" style="s2">mom-and-pop shop down the street because</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.540" end="00:58:45.950" style="s2">Costco sells food but from the point of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.170" end="00:58:47.870" style="s2">view of one nation versus the next by</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.950" end="00:58:51.560" style="s2">and large everybody&#39;s offline from the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.870" end="00:58:53.210" style="s2">point of view of individuals well a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.560" end="00:58:55.490" style="s2">of people are facing the prospect that</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.210" end="00:58:58.040" style="s2">they won&#39;t be able to pay their mortgage</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.490" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">now I realize are their rent or their</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.040" end="00:59:03.680" style="s2">rent now what is that if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:05.150" style="s2">imagine that these were individual cases</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.680" end="00:59:07.250" style="s2">that be very frightening on the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.150" end="00:59:09.800" style="s2">hand when an entire population faces</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.250" end="00:59:12.380" style="s2">these kinds of questions together in</p>

<p begin="00:59:12.380" end="00:59:18.200" style="s2">every house on the block right it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.590" end="00:59:21.410" style="s2">use them and if mortgage relief is built</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.200" end="00:59:24.410" style="s2">into the care act for up to a year</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.410" end="00:59:28.460" style="s2">rent relief is not I believe but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.410" end="00:59:30.410" style="s2">presumably landlords could apply for</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.460" end="00:59:32.540" style="s2">mortgage relief the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.410" end="00:59:34.040" style="s2">homeowners could although there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.540" end="00:59:35.780" style="s2">limitations the mortgage relief built</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.040" end="00:59:37.760" style="s2">into the care act such as that you need</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.780" end="00:59:40.970" style="s2">to have a federally bank loan federally</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.760" end="00:59:45.260" style="s2">backed loan which not all mortgages are</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.970" end="00:59:47.570" style="s2">and and of course you know for people</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.260" end="00:59:48.980" style="s2">who you know for landlords for instance</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.570" end="00:59:51.590" style="s2">who simply own their property outright</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.980" end="00:59:54.440" style="s2">and who are depending on rent for all of</p>

<p begin="00:59:59.119" end="01:00:03.500" style="s2">suddenly all of their renters have no</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.430" end="01:00:06.470" style="s2">ability to pay so it&#39;s not there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.500" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">there is no perfect solution so this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.470" end="01:00:13.099" style="s2">in fact a reflection of exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:15.020" style="s2">getting which is because it is not in</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.099" end="01:00:18.170" style="s2">the interest of banks to foreclose on</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.020" end="01:00:22.700" style="s2">everybody there was no resistance to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.170" end="01:00:25.760" style="s2">idea of basically protecting homeowners</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.700" end="01:00:27.140" style="s2">from facing mortgage default the banks</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.760" end="01:00:28.880" style="s2">didn&#39;t want it because they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.140" end="01:00:30.080" style="s2">to own every house in the block because</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.880" end="01:00:32.450" style="s2">it&#39;d be nobody to sell it to those</p>

<p begin="01:00:35.780" end="01:00:42.280" style="s2">essence what you had is society deciding</p>

<p begin="01:00:42.280" end="01:00:49.250" style="s2">but my point is time outs do not make</p>

<p begin="01:00:52.490" end="01:00:57.080" style="s2">timeout then there&#39;s no such thing as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:01:01.640" style="s2">time out anymore and so what we have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.080" end="01:01:04.070" style="s2">avoid is something where homeowners are</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.640" end="01:01:06.290" style="s2">in a different situation than renters</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.070" end="01:01:07.910" style="s2">where people in one state are in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.290" end="01:01:09.380" style="s2">different situation from another where</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.910" end="01:01:12.160" style="s2">people in one nature and are in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.380" end="01:01:14.930" style="s2">different state than another we have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.160" end="01:01:17.930" style="s2">carefully step away from the game</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.930" end="01:01:21.740" style="s2">theoretic time bomb that&#39;s been set in</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.930" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">motion and then if we manage that then</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.740" end="01:01:25.280" style="s2">we have to figure out how to put in</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:27.260" style="s2">place something so that the next time</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:29.150" style="s2">something unforeseen like this happens</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.260" end="01:01:31.970" style="s2">again we are not in the same predicament</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.150" end="01:01:34.250" style="s2">because the game theory isn&#39;t new right</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.970" end="01:01:36.920" style="s2">this is the thing that put us in that</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.250" end="01:01:39.830" style="s2">predicament but there&#39;s nothing about</p>
