<p begin="00:01:51.090" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">because part of my whole job and my</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:57.600" style="s2">whole sort of experience is telling my</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:00.390" style="s2">personal story over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.600" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">again and it seems to have new twists</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.390" end="00:02:06.090" style="s2">all the time so the the short story is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:09.209" style="s2">that I haven&#39;t been an entrepreneur</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.090" end="00:02:10.340" style="s2">generally in my whole life started</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.209" end="00:02:13.640" style="s2">businesses when I was young</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.340" end="00:02:16.040" style="s2">kid worked as a real estate developer an</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.640" end="00:02:19.220" style="s2">independent sort of construction and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.040" end="00:02:22.790" style="s2">building expert in the 2000s here in</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.220" end="00:02:24.410" style="s2">Washington DC and then after that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.790" end="00:02:26.209" style="s2">the real estate market turned in two</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.410" end="00:02:28.700" style="s2">thousand eight and nine I have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.209" end="00:02:31.069" style="s2">working with charter schools in in DC</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.700" end="00:02:33.769" style="s2">helping them find their own real estate</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.069" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">facilities and so I actually leveraged</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.769" end="00:02:39.049" style="s2">or no leverage I pivoted into charter</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:40.819" style="s2">school leadership I started off as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.049" end="00:02:43.670" style="s2">real estate consultant for charter</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.819" end="00:02:45.590" style="s2">schools than a CEO Oh a CFO and then</p>

<p begin="00:02:45.590" end="00:02:50.150" style="s2">then I became a turnaround expert in</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.780" end="00:02:51.650" style="s2">charter schools in fact I would be hired</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.150" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">to turn around some of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.650" end="00:02:56.030" style="s2">performing education institutions in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:58.190" style="s2">District of Columbia and we had</p>

<p begin="00:02:58.190" end="00:03:01.459" style="s2">it just one time I did it twice some</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.379" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">could say even did it three different</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.459" end="00:03:07.610" style="s2">times and I had a great career there I</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:09.379" style="s2">ended up moving up to the regulator in</p>

<p begin="00:06:25.860" end="00:06:30.839" style="s2">cost but hey if you&#39;re a tough person</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.630" end="00:06:32.099" style="s2">what do you care right yeah one thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.839" end="00:06:32.750" style="s2">that I noticed when I was reading your</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.099" end="00:06:35.210" style="s2">book was</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.750" end="00:06:37.370" style="s2">your DC area connections I resonated</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.210" end="00:06:38.930" style="s2">with that I grew up in the DC area when</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.370" end="00:06:42.470" style="s2">I was a little kid we lived in Anacostia</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.930" end="00:06:44.090" style="s2">southeast DC over on Texas Avenue and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.470" end="00:06:47.360" style="s2">then when I was two we moved Prince</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.090" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">George&#39;s County my dad was a DC cop</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.360" end="00:06:51.050" style="s2">worked his way up one things you</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">mentioned and in the thing that I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.050" end="00:06:56.540" style="s2">grinned about was some of the local DC</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:58.040" style="s2">isms like go-go music and Mambu sauce</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.540" end="00:07:00.680" style="s2">and I remember one of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.040" end="00:07:02.600" style="s2">really loved was getting fried shrimp</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.680" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">with Mambu sauce at the shrimp boat</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.600" end="00:07:07.370" style="s2">northeast DC back in the days right near</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:09.200" style="s2">their 14th police precinct back in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.370" end="00:07:12.169" style="s2">day when my dad had his first command</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.200" end="00:07:16.040" style="s2">job as shift commander over there I&#39;m us</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.169" end="00:07:17.810" style="s2">about 1965 something like that and DC is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.040" end="00:07:19.790" style="s2">an interesting place you know we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.810" end="00:07:21.110" style="s2">of it as the seat of government etc but</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.790" end="00:07:23.390" style="s2">it&#39;s also a city that has its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.110" end="00:07:25.400" style="s2">culture which is kind of cool yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.390" end="00:07:27.730" style="s2">people forget that Washington DC is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.400" end="00:07:30.950" style="s2">city with its own culture and its own</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.730" end="00:07:32.540" style="s2">permanent residents there&#39;s people come</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.950" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">in from out of town all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.540" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">they&#39;re like DC so transient and</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:37.760" style="s2">whatever and I&#39;m thinking to myself</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">everyone that I&#39;m friends with everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.760" end="00:07:42.200" style="s2">that I know here was basically born here</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.550" style="s2">and lived here maybe maybe it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.200" end="00:07:46.250" style="s2">surprise that most of my local</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.550" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">associates are like real estate agents</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.250" end="00:07:51.710" style="s2">hair salon operators local lawyers you</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:53.600" style="s2">know people real estate developers</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.550" style="s2">people that that are that would build</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.600" end="00:07:57.740" style="s2">the city that all these transient people</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.550" end="00:08:00.200" style="s2">come to you so there is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.740" end="00:08:02.960" style="s2">history and roots here in DC and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.200" end="00:08:04.760" style="s2">love living here for the most part but</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:07.100" style="s2">it&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.760" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">justify it in my mind really mighty</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.100" end="00:08:11.300" style="s2">expensive for what it is these days yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:13.610" style="s2">and the part of PG County I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.300" end="00:08:15.260" style="s2">it was you know mostly solid</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.610" end="00:08:17.000" style="s2">working-class folks I think in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.260" end="00:08:18.710" style="s2">little neighborhood you know you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.000" end="00:08:20.630" style="s2">about electricians and plumbers meet</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.710" end="00:08:22.970" style="s2">cutters we had a baker we had a couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.630" end="00:08:25.729" style="s2">of cops a couple of schoolteachers etc</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.970" end="00:08:27.830" style="s2">the demographics later so much to my</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.729" end="00:08:30.050" style="s2">surprise I realized that half the adults</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.830" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">were high school dropouts but they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.050" end="00:08:33.800" style="s2">all solid and respectable folks right I</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:36.050" style="s2">think the divorce rate might have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.800" end="00:08:38.180" style="s2">10% something like that maybe lower a</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.050" end="00:08:39.770" style="s2">lot of my old friends who I&#39;m still in</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.180" end="00:08:41.000" style="s2">regular contacts are just like the kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.770" end="00:08:43.010" style="s2">of people you talk about one&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.000" end="00:08:44.690" style="s2">surveyor another one had a bread route</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.010" end="00:08:46.440" style="s2">that he owned where he delivered bread</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.690" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">the grocery stores</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.440" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">were small-scale home improvement</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:51.870" style="s2">contractors a couple of them made it</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:53.760" style="s2">into the larger side of construction</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.870" end="00:08:54.990" style="s2">other one was a heavy equipment guy so</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.760" end="00:08:56.430" style="s2">yeah those kind of people those are the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.990" end="00:08:57.780" style="s2">kind of people I grew up with and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.430" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">think there&#39;s you know kind of bedrocks</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.780" end="00:09:02.220" style="s2">of America yeah well you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:04.230" style="s2">interesting in Washington that that sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.220" end="00:09:06.570" style="s2">of middle class has been hollowed out in</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.230" end="00:09:08.250" style="s2">the city for sure it&#39;s really polarized</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.570" end="00:09:11.480" style="s2">you know on one side of the park you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.250" end="00:09:14.190" style="s2">got two very wealthy that 1% the top 1%</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.480" end="00:09:15.870" style="s2">you know your think tank people your</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.190" end="00:09:18.180" style="s2">McKinsey people your government</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.870" end="00:09:20.220" style="s2">lobbyists and defense contractors and</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.180" end="00:09:21.720" style="s2">then on the other side of the park it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.220" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of poverty and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.720" end="00:09:26.040" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a lot of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:27.630" style="s2">hunger and a lot of poor educational</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.040" end="00:09:29.790" style="s2">outcomes for our students as well so</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.630" end="00:09:31.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a city of polar</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.790" end="00:09:34.200" style="s2">opposites and of dichotomies of black</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.860" end="00:09:35.940" style="s2">and white it was predominantly an</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.200" end="00:09:38.400" style="s2">african-american city up until just</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.940" end="00:09:40.290" style="s2">recently it&#39;s like the first time in its</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.400" end="00:09:43.500" style="s2">history that it was a it&#39;s now a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.290" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">majority non african-american at least</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.500" end="00:09:48.090" style="s2">since for a long time for sure let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:50.400" style="s2">jump into your book democrat to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.090" end="00:09:52.050" style="s2">deplorable so i&#39;ll put a marker on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.400" end="00:09:54.330" style="s2">ground and before we hop in and say i</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.050" end="00:09:56.670" style="s2">personally kind of did a reverse journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.330" end="00:09:59.310" style="s2">i start out in life and a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.670" end="00:10:00.540" style="s2">conservative cop military family and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.310" end="00:10:02.970" style="s2">had some other reasons we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.540" end="00:10:04.920" style="s2">politically conservative my parents like</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.970" end="00:10:07.080" style="s2">were radicalized in favor of Goldwater</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.920" end="00:10:09.840" style="s2">and I was myself a pretty radical</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.080" end="00:10:11.460" style="s2">Republican up until 1991 with the fall</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.840" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">of communism which was my number one</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.460" end="00:10:15.900" style="s2">issue and I&#39;ve gradually drifted towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:18.780" style="s2">a much more radical view in fact I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.900" end="00:10:20.670" style="s2">now drifted way past the Democrats into</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.780" end="00:10:23.640" style="s2">a space of thinking about how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.670" end="00:10:25.110" style="s2">radically reconstruct society on a much</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.640" end="00:10:28.530" style="s2">more bottoms-up</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.110" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">localist and egalitarian basis so be</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.530" end="00:10:31.980" style="s2">very interesting to explore your journey</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:33.570" style="s2">in the opposite direction but anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.980" end="00:10:36.120" style="s2">started reading the book and I always do</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.570" end="00:10:37.970" style="s2">read the books here fairly carefully it</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.120" end="00:10:40.970" style="s2">seemed to me that one of your initial</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.970" end="00:10:44.010" style="s2">radicalizing experiences was your</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.970" end="00:10:46.350" style="s2">experience with family court family law</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.010" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">and the difficulties fathers in</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.350" end="00:10:50.010" style="s2">particular faced in the impact of those</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">institutions maybe you could tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.010" end="00:10:54.839" style="s2">little bit about that yeah you know in</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:57.240" style="s2">2009 I got divorced and it was the most</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.839" end="00:10:58.120" style="s2">difficult decision I ever made and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.240" end="00:11:00.339" style="s2">looked</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.120" end="00:11:03.850" style="s2">on it and try to analyze it actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.339" end="00:11:07.680" style="s2">quite quite a bit it started me down a</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.850" end="00:11:10.089" style="s2">path of discovery of understanding that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.680" end="00:11:12.819" style="s2">more female relationships</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.089" end="00:11:15.009" style="s2">the family unit the perception of father</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.819" end="00:11:16.809" style="s2">is the perception of masculinity all</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.009" end="00:11:19.360" style="s2">these things were in question and I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.809" end="00:11:23.769" style="s2">no idea really you know I got married in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.360" end="00:11:26.490" style="s2">2002 divorced in 2009 and a lot changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.769" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">in that time period from 2002 to 2009</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.490" end="00:11:31.779" style="s2">not the least of which was internet</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:35.259" style="s2">social media dating apps etc but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.779" end="00:11:37.420" style="s2">was the increasing rise of a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.259" end="00:11:40.629" style="s2">masculinity was something that needed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.420" end="00:11:42.220" style="s2">be dealt with not embraced and it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.629" end="00:11:44.889" style="s2">around that time that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.220" end="00:11:47.439" style="s2">increased activity in the sort of</p>

<p begin="00:11:51.309" end="00:11:56.490" style="s2">masculinity was a bad thing that needed</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.829" end="00:11:58.389" style="s2">to be eradicated because male power</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.540" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">to see is to have the incentives lined</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.460" end="00:18:02.710" style="s2">up to motivate both men and women into</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.510" style="s2">the proper outcome so like when a guy</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.710" end="00:18:06.850" style="s2">like Jordan Peterson starts talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.510" end="00:18:09.160" style="s2">about enforced culturally enforced</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.160" end="00:18:13.570" style="s2">that up it&#39;s just sent off a firestorm</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.750" end="00:18:15.400" style="s2">because people couldn&#39;t comprehend that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.570" end="00:18:16.750" style="s2">culturally enforced is something</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.400" end="00:18:19.390" style="s2">entirely different than you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.750" end="00:18:21.850" style="s2">government enforced Wow but there there</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.390" end="00:18:24.040" style="s2">were distinct advantages to having a</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.850" end="00:18:26.020" style="s2">very you know secure and predictable</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.040" end="00:18:27.610" style="s2">family life it&#39;s good for the parents</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.020" end="00:18:29.830" style="s2">it&#39;s good for the children it&#39;s good for</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.610" end="00:18:31.650" style="s2">society and then the incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.830" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">changed and so when men are</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.650" end="00:18:36.160" style="s2">disincentivized from creating families</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:38.320" style="s2">and from leading families this is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.160" end="00:18:40.750" style="s2">thing this is a bad thing for society in</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.320" end="00:18:43.300" style="s2">general and over time the negative</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.750" end="00:18:45.070" style="s2">effects of that will be compounded I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.300" end="00:18:47.410" style="s2">think and I think it&#39;s a good analogy</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.070" end="00:18:49.510" style="s2">also for our political system our</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.410" end="00:18:52.060" style="s2">economic systems globalization it&#39;s such</p>

<p begin="00:18:52.060" end="00:18:56.290" style="s2">past are broken and as we continue to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.550" end="00:18:59.560" style="s2">feed into the same system we keep</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.290" end="00:19:02.560" style="s2">getting increasingly larger messes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.560" end="00:19:03.700" style="s2">and more broken outcomes instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.560" end="00:19:05.860" style="s2">know trying to wanting to get the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.700" end="00:19:07.870" style="s2">outcome that we desire we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.860" end="00:19:10.600" style="s2">doubling down on these systems and</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.870" end="00:19:12.730" style="s2">getting more negative outcomes but yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.600" end="00:19:14.260" style="s2">we haven&#39;t taken the time to revise the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.730" end="00:19:16.600" style="s2">system or change the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.260" end="00:19:18.550" style="s2">structures or to make structural changes</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.600" end="00:19:19.780" style="s2">we just keep hoping that the outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.550" end="00:19:22.300" style="s2">are gonna be different even though we</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.780" end="00:19:24.010" style="s2">keep doing the same thing and in that</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.300" end="00:19:25.210" style="s2">the definition of insanity doing the</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.510" end="00:20:33.520" style="s2">different yeah first first of all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.780" end="00:20:35.530" style="s2">essay by Peter is fantastic and I really</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.140" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">go down as an excellent piece of</p>

<p begin="00:21:21.100" end="00:21:26.410" style="s2">it was a chance for men to congregate in</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.380" end="00:21:30.280" style="s2">a way that offered them privacy and then</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.410" end="00:21:32.020" style="s2">an anonymity and an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.280" end="00:21:34.810" style="s2">actually share and be a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.020" end="00:21:37.360" style="s2">empathetic and vulnerable than they</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.810" end="00:21:39.370" style="s2">would have been ordinarily because you</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:40.870" style="s2">know there&#39;s no real online community</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.370" end="00:21:42.280" style="s2">without sharing right you have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.870" end="00:21:44.020" style="s2">actually put yourself out there and</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.280" end="00:21:45.970" style="s2">communicate and that takes a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.020" end="00:21:47.710" style="s2">element of vulnerability which is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.970" end="00:21:49.810" style="s2">interesting thread to actually consider</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.450" end="00:24:20.560" style="s2">future gonna look like and all these</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.850" end="00:24:22.660" style="s2">things are tied together with critical</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.560" end="00:24:24.520" style="s2">social justice theory and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.660" end="00:24:27.220" style="s2">intersectionality and VOC ISM and all</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.520" end="00:24:29.380" style="s2">that because we&#39;re trying to get down to</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.220" end="00:24:31.450" style="s2">a sense of truth and we&#39;re trying to get</p>

<p begin="00:24:31.450" end="00:24:35.260" style="s2">that&#39;s been the same ethos for me coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.850" end="00:24:38.620" style="s2">out of the manosphere and into this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.260" end="00:24:41.260" style="s2">which is like what&#39;s going on what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.620" end="00:24:43.540" style="s2">the problems how can we fix it what do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.260" end="00:24:45.130" style="s2">we know that will work currently and</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.540" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">what can we do in the future to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.130" end="00:24:48.610" style="s2">things better and I think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:50.830" style="s2">the that&#39;s the common ground where you</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.310" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2">interesting decentralized network theory</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.410" end="00:25:06.460" style="s2">which is you know when you have a common</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:08.050" style="s2">goal we have different backgrounds we</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.460" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">may have other goals that aren&#39;t aligned</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.050" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">but we do have a common goal in figuring</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.770" style="s2">out these emerging networks how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:17.500" style="s2">design for them how to design for</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.770" end="00:25:19.360" style="s2">emergence how to participate in them how</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.500" end="00:25:20.920" style="s2">to foster them what is the power what</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.360" end="00:25:22.510" style="s2">are understanding what the power of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.920" end="00:25:24.850" style="s2">networks are gonna be in the future and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.510" end="00:25:26.830" style="s2">so that&#39;s you know that&#39;s pull on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.850" end="00:25:28.270" style="s2">thread from the manosphere and I end up</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.830" end="00:25:30.190" style="s2">here talking to you about these issues</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.270" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">so I know that they&#39;re related and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.190" end="00:25:34.390" style="s2">know that they&#39;re connected and I know</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:35.890" style="s2">that they&#39;re important and I&#39;m happy to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.390" end="00:25:37.240" style="s2">be having these conversations with folks</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.890" end="00:25:39.370" style="s2">like you and others so that we can keep</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.240" end="00:25:41.350" style="s2">pushing the ball forward yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.370" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">interesting how these various vectors</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.350" end="00:25:45.580" style="s2">are coming together and to what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:47.860" style="s2">broadly call what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.580" end="00:25:49.750" style="s2">yeah not really sure because the nature</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.860" end="00:25:51.640" style="s2">of emergence if it&#39;s really an emergence</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.750" end="00:25:53.710" style="s2">you can&#39;t predict it but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.640" end="00:25:56.080" style="s2">a growing number of us that realize that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.710" end="00:25:57.880" style="s2">the current game game a is corrupt from</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.080" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">top to bottom it&#39;s also on a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.880" end="00:26:02.560" style="s2">self-destructive path that&#39;s gonna kill</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:04.000" style="s2">us through ecocide if not through some</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.560" end="00:26:06.460" style="s2">other means and it might find some other</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.000" end="00:26:08.560" style="s2">means that do us in quicker and I also</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.460" end="00:26:11.230" style="s2">like you used the word alignment bruce</p>

<p begin="00:26:16.450" end="00:26:21.300" style="s2">to be hugely powerful that those of us</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.550" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">huge clue to me on how to build which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.860" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">from the bottom up from the locality</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:40.450" style="s2">first right rather than you know Big</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.790" end="00:26:48.430" style="s2">and we don&#39;t have to agree as long as</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.880" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">we&#39;re aligned generally on a better way</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.430" end="00:26:52.300" style="s2">to be we can disagree about a number of</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:54.700" style="s2">things as long as we have a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.300" end="00:26:56.800" style="s2">what I call coherent pluralism there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.700" end="00:26:58.120" style="s2">core of things we agree to agree on and</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.800" end="00:27:00.610" style="s2">then everything else we agree that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.120" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">can disagree honorably with right yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.610" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">nothing wrong with that in the slightest</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.200" end="00:27:05.620" style="s2">and I see that is the way forward let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:06.460" style="s2">get back a little bit to your journey</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.620" end="00:27:08.320" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.460" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">now this is one I happen to agree with</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.320" end="00:27:12.220" style="s2">you on you mentioned that you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:13.810" style="s2">traditional and you mentioned the words</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.220" end="00:27:15.730" style="s2">already traditional masculinity is now</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.810" end="00:27:17.680" style="s2">considered toxic and all that business</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.730" end="00:27:19.540" style="s2">funny I was returned to an old online</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.680" end="00:27:21.190" style="s2">community of mine yesterday which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.540" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">been away from from a year it&#39;s kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.330" end="00:27:38.350" style="s2">take their own rhetoric and do a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.800" end="00:27:43.350" style="s2">rhetorical judo which is in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.350" end="00:27:43.350" style="s2">toxic masculinity is hate speech right</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.560" end="00:27:48.850" style="s2">and of course sends him in a tizzy right</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:51.270" style="s2">because oh damn and I use a judo move on</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.850" end="00:27:53.920" style="s2">them because it really is right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.270" end="00:27:54.970" style="s2">toxic means poisonous right let&#39;s look</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.920" end="00:27:57.490" style="s2">it up in the dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.970" end="00:28:01.780" style="s2">toxic means poisonous so how can be a</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.490" end="00:28:04.360" style="s2">normal man with normal masculine values</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.780" end="00:28:07.480" style="s2">in history be labeled toxic and not be</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.360" end="00:28:08.860" style="s2">hate speech indeed it is it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.480" end="00:28:10.750" style="s2">to what you did which is which is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.860" end="00:28:12.160" style="s2">turn of rules around on them which is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.750" end="00:28:13.900" style="s2">use their rhetoric and to use their</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.160" end="00:28:16.180" style="s2">standards and to turn it around and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.900" end="00:28:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s a it usually doesn&#39;t lead to</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.180" end="00:28:20.980" style="s2">anything super productive but it does it</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.910" end="00:28:22.300" style="s2">does sort of take the air out of some of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.980" end="00:28:23.770" style="s2">the attacks that they have and there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.300" end="00:28:26.350" style="s2">people online who dedicate their lives</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.770" end="00:28:28.300" style="s2">to following that rule of making them</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.350" end="00:28:30.910" style="s2">making the other side live up to their</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.300" end="00:28:32.800" style="s2">their own standards but the subject that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.910" end="00:28:33.650" style="s2">you bring up toxic masculinity I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.800" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">that where is that where</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.650" end="00:28:37.550" style="s2">we&#39;re headed with this because we can we</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:40.190" style="s2">can dig into that yeah yeah yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.550" end="00:28:43.040" style="s2">talk about a little bit yeah it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.190" end="00:28:47.480" style="s2">said before you know it it felt it felt</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.040" end="00:28:49.430" style="s2">weird and sort of weak almost to to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.480" end="00:28:51.800" style="s2">out loud that there was an attack on</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.430" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">masculinity or that there was rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.800" end="00:28:55.790" style="s2">around masculinity that was meant to</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:58.370" style="s2">diminish it that seems like a weak</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.790" end="00:29:00.590" style="s2">position almost right it&#39;s like I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:34:29.890" end="00:34:34.510" style="s2">definitely it wasn&#39;t that long ago women</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.610" end="00:35:01.570" style="s2">one of my quotes that will survive is</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.560" end="00:36:49.380" style="s2">talking about feminism and and she has</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.280" end="00:36:50.940" style="s2">unfortunately drank the bathwater and</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.920" end="00:37:11.970" style="s2">statistical curves with big overlaps</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.140" end="00:37:13.590" style="s2">ain&#39;t never gonna happen you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.970" end="00:37:15.090" style="s2">gave her the case of Sweden which she</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.590" end="00:37:17.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t know you probably are aware of</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.090" end="00:37:19.110" style="s2">this that Sweden probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.100" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">gender egalitarian fact I would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.110" end="00:37:23.460" style="s2">certainly the most gender egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:25.560" style="s2">society in human history so far at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.460" end="00:37:29.220" style="s2">since the invention of agriculture the</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.560" end="00:37:31.500" style="s2">CEO of male-female in engineering is</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.220" end="00:37:34.860" style="s2">more skewed towards the male than in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.500" end="00:37:37.740" style="s2">United States the male-female ratio in</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.860" end="00:37:39.810" style="s2">nursing in Sweden is more skewed towards</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.740" end="00:37:42.330" style="s2">female than it is in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.810" end="00:37:44.190" style="s2">and so here&#39;s a country that Inc by any</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.330" end="00:37:46.830" style="s2">standards has gone as far as any other</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.190" end="00:37:50.280" style="s2">country has gone or is likely to go in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.830" end="00:37:52.620" style="s2">an ethos and an age structure for gender</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.280" end="00:37:55.350" style="s2">egalitarianism and yet there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.620" end="00:37:57.620" style="s2">differences in the interests of people</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.350" end="00:38:00.060" style="s2">on average not to say that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.620" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">female engineers there&#39;s plenty of them</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.060" end="00:38:04.260" style="s2">in Sweden but it&#39;s maybe 15 or 20</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:06.210" style="s2">percent or are there male nurses maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.260" end="00:38:08.250" style="s2">it&#39;s ten percent it shouldn&#39;t be zero</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.210" end="00:38:11.400" style="s2">but we should not expect equal outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.250" end="00:38:13.860" style="s2">it&#39;s just unrealistic yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.400" end="00:38:15.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the main issue is is getting well</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.860" end="00:38:17.660" style="s2">there&#39;s some number of things there but</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.180" end="00:38:21.990" style="s2">yes one for sure as I wrote in my book</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.660" end="00:38:24.960" style="s2">the the fight for equal legal conditions</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.990" end="00:38:26.580" style="s2">under the law and the opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.960" end="00:38:28.680" style="s2">whatever you want is a righteous</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.580" end="00:38:32.100" style="s2">injustice war that was fought and won</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:33.930" style="s2">and I support that 110 percent now what</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.100" end="00:38:35.610" style="s2">I also support are women making</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.930" end="00:38:38.190" style="s2">decisions that other women other</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.610" end="00:38:39.720" style="s2">feminists don&#39;t agree with and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.190" end="00:38:42.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be the feminists that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.720" end="00:38:44.370" style="s2">today that are allowing and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.060" end="00:38:46.770" style="s2">believe in female agency and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.370" end="00:38:48.270" style="s2">writing about female agency was one of</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.770" end="00:38:51.780" style="s2">the things that got me in hot water a</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.270" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">few years ago because you know I see out</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.780" end="00:38:56.340" style="s2">there this exact example you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:58.710" style="s2">about if like we need to have 50/50</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.340" end="00:39:00.900" style="s2">gender equality in every profession but</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.710" end="00:39:02.490" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t jive with biology it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.900" end="00:39:04.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t jive with reality it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.490" end="00:39:07.650" style="s2">drive with what women was so effectively</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.680" end="00:39:09.900" style="s2">what you&#39;ve got now our radical third</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.650" end="00:39:12.450" style="s2">and fourth wave feminists who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.900" end="00:39:14.250" style="s2">believe in female agency and don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.450" end="00:39:16.530" style="s2">believe that there are any differences</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.250" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">between men and women and then also</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.530" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">believe that we should regulate</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:24.390" style="s2">legislate and in bureaucratize</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:25.800" style="s2">compelling women into professional</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.390" end="00:39:28.500" style="s2">situations that they don&#39;t want to be in</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.800" end="00:39:30.980" style="s2">you know basically the solution to their</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.500" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">problem their 50-50 problem are</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.980" end="00:39:36.390" style="s2">authoritarian they are basically torture</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:38.250" style="s2">they&#39;re basically slavery is basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.390" end="00:39:39.069" style="s2">compelling people to do things that they</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.250" end="00:39:41.319" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.069" end="00:39:43.180" style="s2">and when women don&#39;t conform to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.319" end="00:39:44.650" style="s2">notion the radical feminists have in</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.180" end="00:39:46.779" style="s2">their mind of how women should behave</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.650" end="00:39:49.900" style="s2">and live then they get all crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.779" end="00:39:52.209" style="s2">insane - and in fact the whole thing mmm</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.900" end="00:39:54.729" style="s2">I again am making the same problem that</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.209" end="00:39:56.829" style="s2">others make which is trying to apply</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.729" end="00:39:58.869" style="s2">rational thought to irrational behavior</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.829" end="00:40:01.420" style="s2">there&#39;s just no there&#39;s no way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.869" end="00:40:03.759" style="s2">and and the more you try to analyze it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.420" end="00:40:05.890" style="s2">and the more you try to apply rational</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.759" end="00:40:08.769" style="s2">lens the more frustrating it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.890" end="00:40:11.589" style="s2">because it is just a mucky gobbly gook</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.769" end="00:40:13.569" style="s2">of nonsense that really lacks at a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.589" end="00:40:16.059" style="s2">fundamental level and appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.569" end="00:40:18.459" style="s2">Liberty and appreciation for personal</p>

<p begin="00:40:21.489" end="00:40:24.940" style="s2">are fundamental to our society</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.959" end="00:40:27.489" style="s2">fundamental to our Western Way of life</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.940" end="00:40:29.199" style="s2">and people who consider themselves today</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.489" end="00:40:32.680" style="s2">still feminists who still fight these</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.199" end="00:40:34.299" style="s2">wars I don&#39;t know if most of them</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.680" end="00:40:37.779" style="s2">understand that they&#39;re actually working</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.299" end="00:40:39.729" style="s2">towards an erosion of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.779" end="00:40:41.589" style="s2">values and the Western values that</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.729" end="00:40:43.989" style="s2">founded our nation that gave them the</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.989" end="00:40:48.339" style="s2">and so there&#39;s like a huge information</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.449" end="00:40:50.559" style="s2">campaign that needs to go on an</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.339" end="00:40:53.109" style="s2">education campaign a national education</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.880" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">rather much like a good prepper does and</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:36.369" style="s2">probably cost me a certain amount of</p>

<p begin="00:44:36.369" end="00:44:39.900" style="s2">earned it all back an interest over the</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.869" end="00:44:43.119" style="s2">last two months I can tell you god damn</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.900" end="00:44:45.130" style="s2">yeah that I think of an ensemble of</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.119" end="00:44:47.050" style="s2">trajectories as a good prepper does</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.130" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">right as I tell my prepper friends you</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.050" end="00:44:50.020" style="s2">know don&#39;t prep for the asteroid that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">killed the dinosaurs if that happened</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.020" end="00:44:52.510" style="s2">just put your head between your legs and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:54.580" style="s2">kiss your ass good-bye</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.510" end="00:44:56.530" style="s2">right but pick a series of scenarios</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.580" end="00:44:58.960" style="s2">which are plausible and prep for those</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.530" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">right and so I think the same way about</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.960" end="00:45:02.619" style="s2">the collapse of game a it could happen</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:04.780" style="s2">tomorrow afternoon might not happen till</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.619" end="00:45:07.510" style="s2">2100 where we gradually eat it up from</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.780" end="00:45:09.250" style="s2">the bottom so I&#39;m kind of open on that</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.510" end="00:45:11.740" style="s2">question another comment about</p>

<p begin="00:45:13.300" end="00:45:18.220" style="s2">brain of many of our elites and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:19.990" style="s2">recently had a discussion a very good</p>

<p begin="00:45:19.990" end="00:45:23.560" style="s2">one of the leading lights of Mehta</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.369" end="00:45:26.560" style="s2">modernism in fact I had a second one</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.560" end="00:45:28.030" style="s2">very recently as well and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.560" end="00:45:30.400" style="s2">things I push back on him he now</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.030" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">actually is kind of agreeing with me I</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.400" end="00:45:35.950" style="s2">said Hansie you estimated that 25% of</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.750" style="s2">people in modern societies like Sweden</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.950" end="00:45:39.910" style="s2">or the United States are post modernists</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.750" end="00:45:41.800" style="s2">I&#39;d say horseshit I think it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.910" end="00:45:43.150" style="s2">1% and he said how do you get to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.800" end="00:45:45.670" style="s2">number and I said here&#39;s how I got to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.150" end="00:45:49.270" style="s2">that number basically take those who</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.670" end="00:45:50.740" style="s2">went to a top 10% elite university which</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.270" end="00:45:52.090" style="s2">will get you down to you know your</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.740" end="00:45:54.040" style="s2">Georgetown&#39;s your University of</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.090" end="00:45:55.930" style="s2">Michigan&#39;s etc the University of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.040" end="00:45:58.000" style="s2">Virginia that&#39;s 10 percent of college</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.930" end="00:46:00.220" style="s2">grads let&#39;s take the 30% of them that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.000" end="00:46:03.609" style="s2">are humanities or social science majors</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.220" end="00:46:05.440" style="s2">that get you to 3% and college grads are</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.609" end="00:46:08.350" style="s2">about a third of our population they get</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.440" end="00:46:09.210" style="s2">you to 1% so only 1% of people have</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.350" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">actually been</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.210" end="00:46:13.740" style="s2">infected with the disease the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:16.470" style="s2">though as you pointed out in passing is</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.740" end="00:46:19.140" style="s2">that these people are absolutely grossly</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.470" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">over concentrated in the higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.140" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">of media the law academia itself so I</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:29.670" style="s2">would argue that the deep disease</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:31.500" style="s2">postmodernist theory is way thinner than</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.670" end="00:46:33.870" style="s2">we think but these people have</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.500" end="00:46:36.300" style="s2">unfortunately seized levers of power on</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.870" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">our institutions so the fight might be</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.300" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">not as bad as we think as long as we</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.530" style="s2">realize that it&#39;s this 1% that is our</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:45.570" style="s2">opponents you know not the institutional</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.530" end="00:46:48.600" style="s2">ramifications that these 1% of caused</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.570" end="00:46:50.310" style="s2">that make sense yeah it definitely does</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.600" end="00:46:53.370" style="s2">and you&#39;re right you know it makes me</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.310" end="00:46:54.870" style="s2">think of Nassim Taleb theory the tyranny</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.370" end="00:46:56.580" style="s2">of the minority so it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.870" end="00:46:58.080" style="s2">matter if you have a majority you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.580" end="00:47:01.950" style="s2">need to have high leverage power which</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.080" end="00:47:04.950" style="s2">they definitely have but as in context</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.950" end="00:47:08.280" style="s2">with our our current social media</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.950" end="00:47:10.680" style="s2">environment the Pomo guys the critical</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.280" end="00:47:12.750" style="s2">guys they don&#39;t have to it&#39;s not who</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.680" end="00:47:15.570" style="s2">studied in college and who has power</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.750" end="00:47:18.510" style="s2">over the lovers now it&#39;s their ability</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.570" end="00:47:20.780" style="s2">to inject these memes and ideas into our</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.510" end="00:47:23.670" style="s2">society which then get it swallowed</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.780" end="00:47:27.870" style="s2">uncritically and so i would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.670" end="00:47:30.270" style="s2">most of America at least blue America</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.870" end="00:47:32.190" style="s2">for sure has swallowed all of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.270" end="00:47:33.750" style="s2">concepts and ideas without even</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.190" end="00:47:36.870" style="s2">questioning it and don&#39;t even realize</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.750" end="00:47:39.720" style="s2">that they have been Trojan horsed as in</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.870" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">a way right so like for example my aunt</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.720" end="00:47:45.090" style="s2">ardent feminist from the 60s right who</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:47.910" style="s2">fought for all the things that we agree</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.090" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">on our good things still calls herself a</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.910" end="00:47:54.560" style="s2">feminist today and snout outs and spouts</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:57.690" style="s2">the poem Oh critical party line</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.560" end="00:47:59.820" style="s2">uncritically because in her mind she</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.690" end="00:48:02.430" style="s2">can&#39;t see that her movement has been</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.820" end="00:48:04.920" style="s2">hijacked and then it happened</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.430" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">all these kids today with the movies and</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.920" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">social media and the memes and and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:14.550" style="s2">know the the television shows that just</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:16.650" style="s2">uncritically spread these notions that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.550" end="00:48:19.890" style="s2">the real struggle is the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.650" end="00:48:22.060" style="s2">struggle and i don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.890" end="00:48:25.600" style="s2">gonna take to wash that out</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.060" end="00:48:29.410" style="s2">also when you&#39;re 1% or 3% you talk about</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.370" end="00:48:41.470" style="s2">they&#39;re like embedded and they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.650" end="00:48:44.410" style="s2">and so it&#39;s it&#39;s I understand what</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.470" end="00:48:45.790" style="s2">you&#39;re saying but I think that when you</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.410" end="00:48:47.470" style="s2">look at it from that perspective it may</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.790" end="00:48:49.270" style="s2">minimize the struggle and it may</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.470" end="00:48:52.180" style="s2">minimize the impact that the ideas are</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.270" end="00:48:55.120" style="s2">having on our society especially when</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.180" end="00:48:58.150" style="s2">most of the frontline soldiers are just</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.120" end="00:49:01.120" style="s2">spouting these those mimetic ideas</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.150" end="00:49:02.770" style="s2">without any critical thinking or</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.120" end="00:49:04.150" style="s2">understanding of where they come from or</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.770" end="00:49:06.550" style="s2">why so when you try to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.150" end="00:49:09.430" style="s2">conversation with them they&#39;re instantly</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.550" end="00:49:11.650" style="s2">triggered mostly I think because when</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.430" end="00:49:13.180" style="s2">they begin to examine their own thought</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.650" end="00:49:15.070" style="s2">process they can&#39;t come up with</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.180" end="00:49:17.920" style="s2">something logical because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.070" end="00:49:20.350" style="s2">logic and so it causes them great</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:22.690" style="s2">frustration and there&#39;s no way to have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.350" end="00:49:24.250" style="s2">conversation with somebody I find that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.690" end="00:49:27.520" style="s2">you know you mentioned the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.250" end="00:49:30.340" style="s2">earlier I find that in order to shake</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.520" end="00:49:32.440" style="s2">people from those thought patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.340" end="00:49:34.900" style="s2">that thought model it takes a crisis it</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.440" end="00:49:36.850" style="s2">takes something external to them it</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.900" end="00:49:38.830" style="s2">takes like a big fucking Club over the</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.850" end="00:49:41.020" style="s2">head but it gives them a moment to</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.830" end="00:49:43.030" style="s2">reconsider because if you&#39;re just going</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.020" end="00:49:44.980" style="s2">about your day to day life you have no</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.030" end="00:49:47.110" style="s2">real reason to question these ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.980" end="00:49:48.550" style="s2">then you know someone questions you you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.110" end="00:49:50.050" style="s2">get angry and you&#39;re like that guy&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.550" end="00:49:51.760" style="s2">asshole what a Nazi and then you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.050" end="00:49:54.610" style="s2">move on you don&#39;t really reconsider it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.760" end="00:49:57.070" style="s2">only when life forces you to reconsider</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.610" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">things that people are gonna take a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.070" end="00:49:59.850" style="s2">hard look and I just don&#39;t know how long</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:01.750" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.850" end="00:50:03.970" style="s2">it&#39;d be interesting to see what comes</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.750" end="00:50:05.560" style="s2">out of this Koba 19 thing some people</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.970" end="00:50:07.150" style="s2">for the first time ever in their life</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.560" end="00:50:09.850" style="s2">they&#39;ve been living in the hammock of</p>

<p begin="00:50:12.070" end="00:50:15.820" style="s2">maybe that&#39;ll start some of them to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.720" end="00:50:17.620" style="s2">more empowered we&#39;re moving along here</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.820" end="00:50:19.990" style="s2">in time kind of fast so let me jump back</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.620" end="00:50:22.150" style="s2">into your book a little bit and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.990" end="00:50:25.030" style="s2">you can tell us a little bit about your</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.150" end="00:50:26.320" style="s2">education work and how all that ended</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.030" end="00:50:28.210" style="s2">and that will kind of take us into a</p>

<p begin="00:54:46.490" end="00:54:51.560" style="s2">know had I done that that&#39;s fine but I</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.180" end="00:55:03.140" style="s2">there&#39;s just no there&#39;s just no excuse</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.550" end="00:55:04.970" style="s2">and it was just a prime example of</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.140" end="00:55:08.210" style="s2">social justice warriors getting in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.970" end="00:55:09.590" style="s2">way of actually positive outcomes for</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.590" end="00:55:13.850" style="s2">help and it&#39;s a sad story that ended</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.960" end="00:55:14.780" style="s2">with the school closing just like a year</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.850" end="00:55:17.390" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.780" end="00:55:18.980" style="s2">and they took it over and drew and ran</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.390" end="00:55:21.170" style="s2">it into the ground and they ruined it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.980" end="00:55:22.490" style="s2">and it&#39;s just something those are the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.170" end="00:55:24.350" style="s2">kind of things that we have to look out</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.490" end="00:55:26.330" style="s2">for all across the country and now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.350" end="00:55:28.070" style="s2">not even just in education it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.330" end="00:55:30.830" style="s2">health care it&#39;s in disability studies</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.070" end="00:55:32.960" style="s2">it&#39;s health being healthy now saying</p>

<p begin="00:55:32.960" end="00:55:36.860" style="s2">oppressive now like so people social</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.360" end="00:55:38.810" style="s2">justice are literally getting in the way</p>

<p begin="00:55:50.330" end="00:55:55.540" style="s2">insane and that was a moment in which I</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.510" end="00:55:57.830" style="s2">realized that no matter what I did I</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.540" end="00:56:00.530" style="s2">would be called a racist and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.830" end="00:56:03.170" style="s2">misogynist no matter what even though I</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.530" end="00:56:05.030" style="s2">basically hired all minorities and women</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.170" end="00:56:07.310" style="s2">for almost 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.030" end="00:56:09.320" style="s2">train them promoted them gave them</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.310" end="00:56:11.810" style="s2">bonuses rewarded their good bit you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.320" end="00:56:13.790" style="s2">good performance gave them free leeway</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.810" end="00:56:16.570" style="s2">to do what they wanted and to implement</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.790" end="00:56:20.600" style="s2">their own ideas and it translated into</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.570" end="00:56:23.630" style="s2">higher test scores for basically a</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.600" end="00:56:25.370" style="s2">hundred percent poverty-stricken kids in</p>

<p begin="00:56:25.370" end="00:56:29.450" style="s2">mattered the only thing that mattered</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.530" end="00:56:31.250" style="s2">was that I was a white dude and they had</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.450" end="00:56:34.150" style="s2">to get rid of me and if they ruined the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.250" end="00:56:36.339" style="s2">whole thing because of it so be it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.150" end="00:56:39.099" style="s2">yeah this social justice warrior</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.339" end="00:56:41.980" style="s2">obsession on race and left foot on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.099" end="00:56:44.740" style="s2">table there is still systemic racism in</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.980" end="00:56:47.259" style="s2">our country there is still residual</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.740" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">implicit racism and everybody including</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.259" end="00:56:52.390" style="s2">black people interestingly the</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:54.099" style="s2">psychology lab tests on implicit racism</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.390" end="00:56:56.079" style="s2">show that majority of blacks actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.099" end="00:56:58.180" style="s2">have negative attitudes about blacks or</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.079" end="00:57:00.279" style="s2">in addition to some negative attitudes</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.180" end="00:57:01.359" style="s2">about whites and whites do too and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.279" end="00:57:04.059" style="s2">these things are real I mean you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.359" end="00:57:06.249" style="s2">expect after 500 600 years of racial</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.059" end="00:57:08.410" style="s2">discrimination much of it legal</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.249" end="00:57:11.319" style="s2">institutionalized horrors like slavery</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.410" end="00:57:13.749" style="s2">there&#39;d still be some left but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.319" end="00:57:15.640" style="s2">not as much left it seems to me as the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.749" end="00:57:17.470" style="s2">insanity of the kind you just described</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.640" end="00:57:20.049" style="s2">represents let me quote a statistic from</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.470" end="00:57:22.690" style="s2">the Gallup poll this is a question I</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.049" end="00:57:24.849" style="s2">find to be the question about real</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.690" end="00:57:26.950" style="s2">racism people who really hate other</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.849" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">people for their race which is do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.950" end="00:57:31.450" style="s2">approve or disapprove of marriage</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:32.829" style="s2">between blacks and whites you know if</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.450" end="00:57:34.509" style="s2">you were a real racist think that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.829" end="00:57:36.359" style="s2">other race is inferior then you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.509" end="00:57:39.670" style="s2">be opposed to people close to you being</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.359" end="00:57:42.130" style="s2">married to them in 1959 how many</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.670" end="00:57:48.549" style="s2">disapproved of marriage between blacks</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.130" end="00:57:50.859" style="s2">and whites 96% disapproved 1959 and 2015</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.549" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">8 percent disapproved</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.859" end="00:57:56.230" style="s2">we went from 96% who I would say could</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:57.880" style="s2">be called on the surface literally</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.230" end="00:58:00.039" style="s2">racist thought marriage between black</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.880" end="00:58:02.170" style="s2">and white was wrong it&#39;s now down to 8%</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.039" end="00:58:04.239" style="s2">over a relatively short period time</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.170" end="00:58:07.299" style="s2">seems like a remarkable progress and yet</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.239" end="00:58:09.099" style="s2">social justice warriors seem more spun</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.299" end="00:58:10.180" style="s2">up than they&#39;ve ever been not to say</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.099" end="00:58:11.799" style="s2">that we should give up the fight we</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.180" end="00:58:14.739" style="s2">still have to get rid of that last 8%</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.799" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">but it seems to me that the intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.739" end="00:58:19.749" style="s2">the foaming has gotten way stronger as</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:23.079" style="s2">the amount of racism has actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.749" end="00:58:24.460" style="s2">declined yes that&#39;s absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.079" end="00:58:27.119" style="s2">and part of the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.460" end="00:58:30.609" style="s2">because as a society becomes flatter</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.119" end="00:58:34.089" style="s2">instances of in equal outcomes become</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.609" end="00:58:36.420" style="s2">more prominent and so there when the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.089" end="00:58:39.670" style="s2">this is the real rub</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.420" end="00:58:43.210" style="s2">there has never been a time in America</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.670" end="00:58:44.859" style="s2">where minorities and women have had had</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.210" end="00:58:47.410" style="s2">more rights more opportunities more</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.859" end="00:58:49.089" style="s2">people rooting for them to win there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.410" end="00:58:51.069" style="s2">never been in a time in America where</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.089" end="00:58:54.539" style="s2">there was more money spent on education</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.069" end="00:58:57.039" style="s2">more of a focus of closing the education</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.539" end="00:58:59.470" style="s2">achievement gap there&#39;s never been a</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.039" end="00:59:01.900" style="s2">time at which the corporate America</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.470" end="00:59:05.559" style="s2">wanted to hire more minorities more</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.900" end="00:59:08.019" style="s2">people of color more women etc etc never</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.559" end="00:59:09.670" style="s2">never has there been a time at which the</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.019" end="00:59:13.380" style="s2">whole society was working towards that</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.670" end="00:59:15.430" style="s2">and yet we find there are persistent</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.380" end="00:59:17.440" style="s2">differences in outcomes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.430" end="00:59:18.880" style="s2">differences in education outcomes or</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.440" end="00:59:22.960" style="s2">differences and professional outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.880" end="00:59:25.029" style="s2">and so now because most of the limiting</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.960" end="00:59:27.339" style="s2">factors have been peeled away now people</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.029" end="00:59:29.980" style="s2">are left to become who they are</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.339" end="00:59:31.329" style="s2">basically because of who they are and of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.980" end="00:59:34.029" style="s2">their personal choices and the choices</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.329" end="00:59:36.010" style="s2">of their families and such and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.029" end="00:59:37.990" style="s2">there&#39;s not a hundred percent equal</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.010" end="00:59:40.210" style="s2">outcome in that environment then it has</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.990" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">to be only because there are racists out</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.210" end="00:59:45.539" style="s2">there and so as long as there is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:49.720" style="s2">persistence in a difference of outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.539" end="00:59:53.440" style="s2">the left majority left now will only be</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.720" end="00:59:55.980" style="s2">able to point to a mythical fabricated</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.440" end="00:59:58.450" style="s2">sense of racism that&#39;s out there because</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.980" end="00:59:59.950" style="s2">don&#39;t push back a little bit on this the</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.450" end="01:00:03.309" style="s2">remaining you know element of core</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.950" end="01:00:05.109" style="s2">institutional racism in America that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.309" end="01:00:07.420" style="s2">all assuming that there are actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.109" end="01:00:10.089" style="s2">people sitting in a position at a desk</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.420" end="01:00:12.759" style="s2">somewhere that&#39;s deciding to act in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.089" end="01:00:15.700" style="s2">racist capacity when we talk about there</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.759" end="01:00:18.640" style="s2">being a gender gap in wages that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.700" end="01:00:20.829" style="s2">just like some if it if it to the extent</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.640" end="01:00:24.220" style="s2">that it exists which it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.829" end="01:00:26.259" style="s2">not just like some big figure you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.220" end="01:00:27.430" style="s2">ethereal ephemeral figure out there that</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.259" end="01:00:29.470" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing a finger at no you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.430" end="01:00:31.240" style="s2">actually pointing the finger at a guy at</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.470" end="01:00:33.730" style="s2">a desk or a woman at a desk</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.240" end="01:00:34.990" style="s2">who&#39;s looking at a resume and looking</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.730" end="01:00:37.390" style="s2">across the table at somebody and being</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.990" end="01:00:38.769" style="s2">like well we usually pay men a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.390" end="01:00:40.750" style="s2">grand for this job because she&#39;s a woman</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.769" end="01:00:43.509" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pay her 70 grand that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.750" end="01:00:45.339" style="s2">that means is it when when people talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.509" end="01:00:48.440" style="s2">about institutional racism or</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.339" end="01:00:51.109" style="s2">discrimination I it to me it&#39;s a cop-out</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.440" end="01:00:53.810" style="s2">because it&#39;s avoiding actually zeroing</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.109" end="01:00:56.359" style="s2">down on the specific instances on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.810" end="01:00:58.760" style="s2">margin at which discrimination allegedly</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.359" end="01:01:00.770" style="s2">is taking place and so when you really</p>

<p begin="01:01:00.770" end="01:01:04.339" style="s2">happening there there have to be people</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.660" end="01:01:06.050" style="s2">who are making these decisions and</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.339" end="01:01:09.349" style="s2">frankly I just don&#39;t see that happening</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.050" end="01:01:11.060" style="s2">out there at all and unfortunately there</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.349" end="01:01:14.000" style="s2">are going to be differences in outcomes</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.060" end="01:01:15.950" style="s2">across all groups of people we know this</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.000" end="01:01:17.990" style="s2">to be a fact we know we can study</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.950" end="01:01:20.089" style="s2">science shows us that men and women at</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.990" end="01:01:21.829" style="s2">large have differences in preferences</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.089" end="01:01:24.230" style="s2">and psychological makeups that are going</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.829" end="01:01:26.480" style="s2">to lead to different outcomes like men</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.230" end="01:01:28.369" style="s2">being men and women being women free to</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.480" end="01:01:29.960" style="s2">be who they want to be are going to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.369" end="01:01:32.480" style="s2">different income levels that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.960" end="01:01:34.670" style="s2">something we all need to accept but</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.480" end="01:01:37.069" style="s2">nobody can seem to accept that fact and</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.670" end="01:01:38.720" style="s2">and that is going to apply to tall</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.069" end="01:01:40.910" style="s2">people being better at basketball and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.720" end="01:01:42.260" style="s2">smart people being better at physics and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.910" end="01:01:44.450" style="s2">whatever the case may be there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.260" end="01:01:46.190" style="s2">be differences and outcomes and as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.450" end="01:01:48.530" style="s2">pointed out rightfully in the Swedish</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.190" end="01:01:50.660" style="s2">model when people are given is the the</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.530" end="01:01:53.089" style="s2">maximum amount of freedom to be who they</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.660" end="01:01:54.680" style="s2">are and who they want to be they end up</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.089" end="01:01:56.000" style="s2">picking things that are different from</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.680" end="01:01:58.640" style="s2">other people and they end up having</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.000" end="01:02:00.530" style="s2">different outcomes so as a society we</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.640" end="01:02:02.300" style="s2">have to accept and we haven&#39;t gotten</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.530" end="01:02:04.730" style="s2">there yet especially in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.300" end="01:02:06.950" style="s2">Education we have to accept that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.730" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">going to be different outcomes and until</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.950" end="01:02:10.670" style="s2">we can accept that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:13.579" style="s2">different outcomes there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.670" end="01:02:15.740" style="s2">this ongoing war on racism and war on</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.579" end="01:02:18.589" style="s2">oppression and more on masculinity or on</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.740" end="01:02:21.020" style="s2">white people because today now it</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.589" end="01:02:23.300" style="s2">becomes the only explanation rather than</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.020" end="01:02:25.190" style="s2">accepting the fact that there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.300" end="01:02:27.230" style="s2">be different outcomes now as my</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.190" end="01:02:30.650" style="s2">experience in education has shown me</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.230" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">there are two factors which almost 100%</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.650" end="01:02:35.180" style="s2">correlate with student outcomes it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:37.400" style="s2">the education level of the mother and</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.180" end="01:02:39.380" style="s2">the income level of the zip code that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.400" end="01:02:42.140" style="s2">the student comes from those things</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.380" end="01:02:44.119" style="s2">which then actually have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.140" end="01:02:46.730" style="s2">to race because of our history and</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.119" end="01:02:48.500" style="s2">because of the way the cities work and a</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.730" end="01:02:51.440" style="s2">welfare state works and the soul system</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.500" end="01:02:53.359" style="s2">works which can also argue you know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.440" end="01:02:55.069" style="s2">there is that that is one element of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.359" end="01:02:57.500" style="s2">quote the institutional racism but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.069" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">not racism per se at this point because</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.500" end="01:03:00.650" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s help right it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:02.540" style="s2">welfare system is meant to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.650" end="01:03:05.090" style="s2">for great but it&#39;s actually causing</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.540" end="01:03:06.920" style="s2">problems and so when the outcomes are</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.090" end="01:03:09.320" style="s2">unequal which they are the achievement</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.920" end="01:03:12.650" style="s2">gap is persistent and consistent by</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.320" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">those factors all across the country we</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.650" end="01:03:15.890" style="s2">have to accept that throwing more money</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:17.750" style="s2">at that&#39;s not going to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.890" end="01:03:20.690" style="s2">calling more people racism is not going</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.750" end="01:03:22.190" style="s2">to solve the problem in fact I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.690" end="01:03:23.600" style="s2">accepting that they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.190" end="01:03:25.880" style="s2">different outcomes is a humane and</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.600" end="01:03:27.740" style="s2">empathetic way to go about your life and</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.880" end="01:03:29.210" style="s2">this is where it gets difficult to have</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.740" end="01:03:31.840" style="s2">these conversations I had a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.210" end="01:03:34.370" style="s2">like this with the with an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.840" end="01:03:36.050" style="s2">psychologist but Weingard you know and</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.370" end="01:03:38.270" style="s2">here in trouble for talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.050" end="01:03:39.860" style="s2">kind of stuff because you can accept</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.270" end="01:03:41.630" style="s2">that there are differences there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.860" end="01:03:43.460" style="s2">innate differences biological</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.630" end="01:03:45.740" style="s2">differences psychological differences</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.460" end="01:03:47.690" style="s2">differences and outcomes without all of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.740" end="01:03:50.030" style="s2">a sudden like taking some great leap</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.690" end="01:03:52.940" style="s2">into supremacy and oppression and like</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.030" end="01:03:55.940" style="s2">eugenics and shit it&#39;s like we just need</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.940" end="01:03:57.860" style="s2">to look around and accept a reality so</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.940" end="01:04:00.080" style="s2">that we can we can do the things which</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.860" end="01:04:01.940" style="s2">are going to improve it and right now I</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.080" end="01:04:03.650" style="s2">just don&#39;t see that happening at all and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.940" end="01:04:06.050" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit frustrating and</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.650" end="01:04:09.320" style="s2">so to get to tie this all back together</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.050" end="01:04:12.380" style="s2">when when if society is flat like ours</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.320" end="01:04:14.150" style="s2">is instances of differing outcomes are</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.380" end="01:04:17.480" style="s2">going to be assigned</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.150" end="01:04:18.910" style="s2">but the racism tag until we can accept</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.480" end="01:04:20.900" style="s2">that there are actually going to be</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.910" end="01:04:23.750" style="s2">differences in outcomes based on</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.900" end="01:04:25.340" style="s2">preferences and based on abilities and</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.750" end="01:04:26.810" style="s2">in so that&#39;s how I miss it you know I</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.340" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.810" end="01:04:31.700" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to get people to accept</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:33.710" style="s2">that to be honest yeah push back just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.700" end="01:04:36.500" style="s2">little which is especially with respect</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.710" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">to race I think so-called systemic</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.500" end="01:04:40.310" style="s2">racism which I like it&#39;s a better term</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:43.070" style="s2">than institutional racism one can argue</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.310" end="01:04:44.990" style="s2">that the effects of past racism must</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.070" end="01:04:47.120" style="s2">still be substantially impacting the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.990" end="01:04:50.570" style="s2">african-american community you know I</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.120" end="01:04:52.670" style="s2">bought a house in the in 2002 in Santa</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.570" end="01:04:55.490" style="s2">Fe New Mexico and right in the title it</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.670" end="01:04:57.560" style="s2">said as a covenant you may not sell this</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.490" end="01:05:01.040" style="s2">house to a black person right that</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.560" end="01:05:02.720" style="s2">became unenforceable maybe in 1968 or</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.040" end="01:05:06.590" style="s2">there abouts but I mean there was</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.720" end="01:05:09.110" style="s2">absolutely rigid racism in housing there</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.590" end="01:05:10.730" style="s2">was redlining and banking it was illegal</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.110" end="01:05:13.660" style="s2">for a black person to marry a white</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.730" end="01:05:16.180" style="s2">person here in Virginia until 1967 and</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.660" end="01:05:19.000" style="s2">that has had to have long-term systemic</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.180" end="01:05:19.839" style="s2">impact on the culture on the Family</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.950" end="01:05:28.839" style="s2">definitely the other one is the implicit</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.289" end="01:05:30.849" style="s2">racism is real I mean there&#39;s lab</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.839" end="01:05:32.260" style="s2">psychology tests show it clearly and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.849" end="01:05:34.329" style="s2">there&#39;s even much more pragmatic</p>

<p begin="01:05:34.329" end="01:05:38.440" style="s2">about you send a resume and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.460" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">identical except the name is you know</p>

<p begin="01:05:43.510" end="01:05:50.109" style="s2">gonna get 20 or 30% more replies from</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.750" end="01:05:52.299" style="s2">employers than Jamal Robinson well so</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.109" end="01:05:53.890" style="s2">that&#39;s still there and I think it&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.299" end="01:05:57.099" style="s2">premature to say the fight against</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.890" end="01:05:58.839" style="s2">racism is over but we&#39;ve made a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.099" end="01:06:00.700" style="s2">progress and then the other one that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.839" end="01:06:02.559" style="s2">did not mention which unfortunately gets</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.700" end="01:06:06.670" style="s2">to be a third rail and discussions about</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.559" end="01:06:09.609" style="s2">this is partially impact of past racism</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.670" end="01:06:12.789" style="s2">and random evolutionary drift has</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.609" end="01:06:15.190" style="s2">produced some sub cultural issues that I</p>

<p begin="01:06:35.079" end="01:06:39.579" style="s2">white and therefore you know hateful and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.630" end="01:06:41.380" style="s2">you remember what being a junior high</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.579" end="01:06:43.510" style="s2">school kid was like you know being out</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.380" end="01:06:46.089" style="s2">of touch with your you know your local</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.510" end="01:06:47.770" style="s2">culture is a tough thing when you&#39;re 13</p>

<p begin="01:06:47.770" end="01:06:52.750" style="s2">is you know doing well in algebra is</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.440" end="01:06:54.339" style="s2">acting white an awful lot of black kids</p>

<p begin="01:15:14.870" end="01:15:19.700" style="s2">beholding to Trump in fact I wrote very</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.180" end="01:15:21.560" style="s2">clearly in the book that supporting him</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.700" end="01:15:24.020" style="s2">is awesome often times very distasteful</p>

<p begin="01:15:40.730" end="01:15:44.900" style="s2">and total justification for supporting</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.530" end="01:15:47.390" style="s2">Donald Trump I wrote in my book I wrote</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.900" end="01:15:49.130" style="s2">as early as 2016 before Trump was even</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.390" end="01:15:51.560" style="s2">the candidate before he was even the</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.130" end="01:15:54.860" style="s2">nominee I said that Donald Trump as</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.560" end="01:15:57.080" style="s2">president will remedy the title 9 crisis</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.860" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">and if he doesn&#39;t it will all be worth</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.080" end="01:16:00.680" style="s2">it to me and guess what Jim just two</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:02.930" style="s2">days ago in the last 24 hours he</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.680" end="01:16:05.540" style="s2">actually did that a restored due process</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.930" end="01:16:07.550" style="s2">and justice to our universities and</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.540" end="01:16:09.200" style="s2">restored free speech and protection of</p>

<p begin="01:16:11.150" end="01:16:16.100" style="s2">good about my choice also he understands</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.220" end="01:16:18.020" style="s2">that were in conflict with China so now</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.100" end="01:16:20.330" style="s2">again that those social issues have been</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.020" end="01:16:23.150" style="s2">resolved and the Democrats went all</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.330" end="01:16:24.860" style="s2">haywire and nutso it makes me open up my</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.150" end="01:16:27.080" style="s2">mind to other candidates and I have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.860" end="01:16:29.810" style="s2">fight not only for the positions that I</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.080" end="01:16:31.130" style="s2">believe in which I&#39;ve already stated but</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.810" end="01:16:33.080" style="s2">I also have to fight against the</p>

<p begin="01:17:04.520" end="01:17:07.820" style="s2">things that I believe in but I have to</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.750" end="01:17:09.290" style="s2">vote for a viable candidate that will</p>

<p begin="01:17:20.720" end="01:17:24.680" style="s2">that out there in the world because if</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.250" end="01:17:26.480" style="s2">people really truly understood what it</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.680" end="01:17:28.340" style="s2">meant to vote for Democrats especially</p>

<p begin="01:17:44.870" end="01:17:48.230" style="s2">understood what they were voting for if</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:50.060" style="s2">they voted for the Democrats I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.230" end="01:17:51.950" style="s2">think any of them would because they</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.060" end="01:17:54.410" style="s2">don&#39;t understand it goes back to what we</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.950" end="01:17:56.780" style="s2">were talking about before about only 3%</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.410" end="01:17:58.310" style="s2">of the world are our critical theorists</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.780" end="01:17:59.750" style="s2">or whatever but doesn&#39;t matter when half</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.310" end="01:18:02.870" style="s2">the country has swallowed their memes</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.750" end="01:18:04.610" style="s2">and believes them and espouses them then</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.870" end="01:18:06.170" style="s2">we have to educate we have to change</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.610" end="01:18:08.810" style="s2">their minds we have to show them what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.170" end="01:18:10.490" style="s2">actually happening and that&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.810" end="01:18:12.320" style="s2">been part of one of my missions in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.490" end="01:18:15.680" style="s2">last few years is just try to pull back</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.320" end="01:18:18.860" style="s2">the covers I use a metaphor in a book</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.680" end="01:18:20.690" style="s2">often about the sanitizing effect of</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.860" end="01:18:23.120" style="s2">daylight you know we just need to expose</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.690" end="01:18:25.760" style="s2">these things because if you talk about</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.120" end="01:18:27.530" style="s2">them enough the logical conclusion to</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.760" end="01:18:29.390" style="s2">talking about them is that they will go</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.530" end="01:18:32.060" style="s2">away because there&#39;s no logic there and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.390" end="01:18:35.300" style="s2">so that&#39;s my mission and again just to</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.060" end="01:18:38.060" style="s2">wrap it all up but like the Democrats</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.300" end="01:18:40.010" style="s2">left me I left the Democrats at the same</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.060" end="01:18:42.680" style="s2">time because the Democrats aren&#39;t who</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.010" end="01:18:44.870" style="s2">they used to be there is no you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.680" end="01:18:47.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not the Democrats at the 90s I</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.870" end="01:18:48.260" style="s2">voted for Clinton Bill Clinton I voted</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.090" end="01:18:51.260" style="s2">for Barack Obama</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.260" end="01:18:52.910" style="s2">I was a lifelong Democrat but once a few</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.260" end="01:18:55.250" style="s2">of those social issues were resolved and</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.910" end="01:18:56.600" style="s2">combine that with them careening wildly</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.250" end="01:18:59.960" style="s2">to the left it became an absolute</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.600" end="01:19:02.360" style="s2">no-brainer and and I believe no diss on</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.960" end="01:19:03.830" style="s2">anybody but if you dig deep into their</p>

<p begin="01:24:46.360" end="01:24:51.340" style="s2">fact my version at least of game B is an</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.120" end="01:24:53.290" style="s2">Enlightenment 2.0 and this is something</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.340" end="01:24:55.840" style="s2">that Ponzi phrenic and I agree on that</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.290" end="01:24:57.670" style="s2">the Enlightenment needs some upgrade and</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.840" end="01:24:59.890" style="s2">improvement but it didn&#39;t indeed</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.670" end="01:25:02.470" style="s2">enlighten the world so very important</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.890" end="01:25:04.390" style="s2">but there are days I think that Trump is</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.470" end="01:25:06.070" style="s2">suffering from tertiary syphilis I mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.390" end="01:25:11.160" style="s2">how could somebody say the shit that the</p>

<p begin="01:25:16.540" end="01:25:20.170" style="s2">thing to remember is you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.580" end="01:25:22.300" style="s2">trained his whole life is dealing with</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.170" end="01:25:25.120" style="s2">the media and the media has never been</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.300" end="01:25:27.040" style="s2">straight about anything so he plays to</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.120" end="01:25:28.720" style="s2">the media the media plays with him I</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.040" end="01:25:29.200" style="s2">have no idea what he says behind closed</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.720" end="01:25:30.880" style="s2">doors</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.200" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">I do remember his interviews with like</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.880" end="01:25:36.700" style="s2">Oprah Winfrey in the 80s very clear</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:38.410" style="s2">thinker always had America at her always</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.700" end="01:25:40.980" style="s2">interested in protecting America from</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.410" end="01:25:43.900" style="s2">foreign competitors always interested in</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.980" end="01:25:44.340" style="s2">taking care of American worker and</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.900" end="01:25:46.199" style="s2">prevent</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.340" end="01:25:48.270" style="s2">taking the Chinese or Japanese takeovers</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.199" end="01:25:50.760" style="s2">if you read his interviews and Playboy</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.270" end="01:25:52.469" style="s2">and stuff from the 80s and 90s he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.760" end="01:25:54.119" style="s2">been he&#39;s still talking about the same</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.469" end="01:25:56.130" style="s2">things he&#39;d been talking about back then</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.119" end="01:25:59.130" style="s2">and his whole worldview was shaped</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.130" end="01:26:02.159" style="s2">mostly by real estate in New York City</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.130" end="01:26:03.690" style="s2">in the 80s where he saw how the Japanese</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.159" end="01:26:05.639" style="s2">had been taking our lunch in an</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.690" end="01:26:07.230" style="s2">industrial world than taking our dollars</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.639" end="01:26:09.389" style="s2">coming back to United States and buying</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.230" end="01:26:11.580" style="s2">up precious assets and he saw that and</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.389" end="01:26:13.139" style="s2">he lived it he remembers when</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.580" end="01:26:15.119" style="s2">Rockefeller Center was purchased by a</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.139" end="01:26:17.340" style="s2">Japanese company that really left a big</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.119" end="01:26:19.920" style="s2">impact on him and he&#39;s been singing the</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.340" end="01:26:22.349" style="s2">same notes basically for 40 years now</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.920" end="01:26:24.060" style="s2">does he lie and twist and exaggerate and</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.349" end="01:26:26.099" style="s2">be all hyperbolic and shit hundred</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.060" end="01:26:29.010" style="s2">percent can I listen to him talk all the</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.099" end="01:26:30.179" style="s2">time no I certainly cannot but I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.010" end="01:26:32.250" style="s2">that there are some broad general</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.179" end="01:26:34.710" style="s2">strokes that make some sense to me and</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.250" end="01:26:36.690" style="s2">again you know he is the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.710" end="01:26:38.699" style="s2">pushing back against these things which</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.690" end="01:26:40.050" style="s2">are fundamentally a conflict of interest</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.699" end="01:26:41.639" style="s2">with Western civilization</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.050" end="01:26:44.699" style="s2">does he do it in a way that&#39;s unsavory</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.639" end="01:26:47.460" style="s2">and kind of gross sure but you know what</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.699" end="01:26:50.340" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m focused on existential threats</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.460" end="01:26:52.739" style="s2">I&#39;m not focused on being offended and by</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.340" end="01:26:54.389" style="s2">the way what president what person who</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.739" end="01:26:55.889" style="s2">aspires to be the leader of the free</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.389" end="01:26:57.929" style="s2">world doesn&#39;t have some element of</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.889" end="01:26:59.610" style="s2">narcissism built into them in fact I</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.929" end="01:27:01.500" style="s2">think it&#39;s a precondition for the job</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.610" end="01:27:03.480" style="s2">because who the who the hell would want</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.500" end="01:27:05.190" style="s2">to be presidents a worst job in America</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.480" end="01:27:07.050" style="s2">but you got to do it and there&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.190" end="01:27:10.469" style="s2">be reasons for it and on this issue</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.050" end="01:27:13.980" style="s2">about kovat I would argue that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.469" end="01:27:18.480" style="s2">network&#39;s chose when to shut down the</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.980" end="01:27:21.060" style="s2">country not the President and not CDC</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.480" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">and the World Health Organization both</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.060" end="01:27:25.230" style="s2">of those institutions were were</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:28.290" style="s2">themselves behind the curve and in fact</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.230" end="01:27:31.650" style="s2">the w-h-o and CDC both were giving</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.290" end="01:27:34.500" style="s2">totally contrary opinions or sort of</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.650" end="01:27:36.270" style="s2">giving advice at ran contrary to what we</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.500" end="01:27:38.070" style="s2">ended up thinking was the right thing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.270" end="01:27:41.400" style="s2">do as late as late February and early</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.070" end="01:27:43.530" style="s2">March so I I push back on this too I</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.400" end="01:27:45.420" style="s2">think that he&#39;s handled kovat as well as</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.530" end="01:27:48.090" style="s2">any of our leaders could possibly have</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.420" end="01:27:50.849" style="s2">done it and in fact he shut down the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.090" end="01:27:53.940" style="s2">economy and the Kilda stock market which</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.849" end="01:27:56.040" style="s2">if you think about it well the two</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.940" end="01:27:58.120" style="s2">things that he hold most important and</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.040" end="01:27:59.830" style="s2">dear to him so he</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.120" end="01:28:01.840" style="s2">that even knowing that it was going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.830" end="01:28:03.640" style="s2">destroy his economy that he had built</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.840" end="01:28:06.340" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna destroy the Dow Jones which</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.640" end="01:28:08.920" style="s2">he you know it&#39;s taking claim for credit</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.340" end="01:28:10.720" style="s2">for so he did that in knowing that it</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.920" end="01:28:12.550" style="s2">was going to be a problem for him but I</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.720" end="01:28:15.550" style="s2">would argue anyway no matter who the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.550" end="01:28:17.860" style="s2">president was the network of sense</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.550" end="01:28:19.000" style="s2">makers of which we were a part in a limo</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.860" end="01:28:21.520" style="s2">order for sure</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.000" end="01:28:23.650" style="s2">decided on our own when it was time to</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.520" end="01:28:25.870" style="s2">shut down I don&#39;t think for one second</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.650" end="01:28:28.660" style="s2">that in late February</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.870" end="01:28:30.670" style="s2">that the the country itself was ready to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.660" end="01:28:33.520" style="s2">accept closures he&#39;ll the country isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.670" end="01:28:35.080" style="s2">ready to accept closures today so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.520" end="01:28:37.420" style="s2">not sure what more could have been done</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.080" end="01:28:39.490" style="s2">all of the stuff about the ventilators</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.420" end="01:28:41.080" style="s2">totally overblown they didn&#39;t even need</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.490" end="01:28:43.000" style="s2">the ones they sent to New York City all</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.080" end="01:28:44.410" style="s2">this stuff I don&#39;t know how much better</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.000" end="01:28:47.710" style="s2">it could have been handled and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.410" end="01:28:50.290" style="s2">know in our current system to what</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.710" end="01:28:53.020" style="s2">extent he even has the comp you know the</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.290" end="01:28:55.030" style="s2">control or the capability of doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.020" end="01:28:57.010" style="s2">things quote earlier or doing things in</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.030" end="01:28:59.110" style="s2">a more significant way the network&#39;s are</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.010" end="01:29:00.940" style="s2">in control now and it&#39;s public the</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.110" end="01:29:02.410" style="s2">public information networks that drew us</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.940" end="01:29:04.180" style="s2">into the closure and they&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.410" end="01:29:06.910" style="s2">the ones that draw us out into whatever</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.180" end="01:29:07.120" style="s2">the final resolution is gonna be all</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.910" end="01:29:09.610" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.120" end="01:29:10.990" style="s2">well said I think I could disagree about</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.610" end="01:29:14.500" style="s2">some of the details about Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.990" end="01:29:16.660" style="s2">handling but let&#39;s move on the section</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.500" end="01:29:19.420" style="s2">here which is about the new masculinity</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.660" end="01:29:22.090" style="s2">or what is some positive models for</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.420" end="01:29:23.800" style="s2">masculinity going forward and I as doing</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.090" end="01:29:26.110" style="s2">my prep and I says you know I do a lot</p>

<p begin="01:29:46.540" end="01:29:50.590" style="s2">had a lot of fun with that so basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.040" end="01:29:52.480" style="s2">what happened is my mom was in from out</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.590" end="01:29:54.280" style="s2">of town and I&#39;ve got three kids and so</p>

<p begin="01:30:07.850" end="01:30:12.230" style="s2">and before I knew it there was like a</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.500" end="01:30:13.820" style="s2">whole crew of like eight to ten to 12</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.230" end="01:30:15.080" style="s2">year old boys I just showed up out of</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.820" end="01:30:17.690" style="s2">nowhere to start playing in our</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.080" end="01:30:19.700" style="s2">dodgeball game and the more aggressive</p>

<p begin="01:30:25.550" end="01:30:29.600" style="s2">and my first reaction I looked at him</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.860" end="01:30:31.750" style="s2">was you know where&#39;s your dad and he</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.600" end="01:30:34.370" style="s2">goes I don&#39;t have a dad that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.750" end="01:30:36.920" style="s2">and I looked around and I started to</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.370" end="01:30:39.380" style="s2">observe and I noticed that oh there were</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.920" end="01:30:41.210" style="s2">no fathers they&#39;re the ones who were</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.380" end="01:30:43.220" style="s2">there were had their nose buried in</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.210" end="01:30:45.110" style="s2">their phone there were moms there</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.220" end="01:30:47.930" style="s2">without their husbands there were boys</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.110" end="01:30:49.520" style="s2">there who didn&#39;t have dads and the dads</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.930" end="01:30:51.080" style="s2">who were there weren&#39;t engaged they</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.520" end="01:30:54.200" style="s2">weren&#39;t involved and one of them were</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.080" end="01:30:55.730" style="s2">being physical or aggressive or smashing</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.200" end="01:30:57.860" style="s2">kids in the face with little nerf balls</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.730" end="01:30:59.840" style="s2">on a trampoline net where the kids</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.860" end="01:31:01.820" style="s2">absolutely flipped and loved it right</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.840" end="01:31:03.470" style="s2">the boys loved it so much I had to like</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.820" end="01:31:06.080" style="s2">send them away after a while because I</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.470" end="01:31:08.900" style="s2">want to get back to my own family and it</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.080" end="01:31:10.910" style="s2">just became as I was writing about it it</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.900" end="01:31:12.950" style="s2">just became a great example to me like</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.910" end="01:31:14.990" style="s2">where is the male leadership in our</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.950" end="01:31:17.080" style="s2">society today where are the dads out</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.990" end="01:31:19.370" style="s2">there leading our families where is the</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.080" end="01:31:22.040" style="s2">aggressiveness and competition and</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.370" end="01:31:24.800" style="s2">physicality especially physicality</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.040" end="01:31:26.240" style="s2">between dads and boys is important right</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.800" end="01:31:27.680" style="s2">kids have to learn you know what</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.240" end="01:31:29.540" style="s2">boundaries are they have to learn how</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.680" end="01:31:32.540" style="s2">aggressive they can be without you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.540" end="01:31:34.550" style="s2">making other people upset how to play</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.540" end="01:31:37.010" style="s2">play is such an important part of</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.550" end="01:31:39.500" style="s2">childhood development the whole story</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.010" end="01:31:41.330" style="s2">just became an allegory or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.500" end="01:31:44.840" style="s2">a metaphor or whatever I&#39;m not a writer</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.330" end="01:31:47.960" style="s2">oh wait I am that the sort of emblematic</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.840" end="01:31:49.760" style="s2">of society like you know the dads just</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.960" end="01:31:51.320" style="s2">weren&#39;t there and it dads weren&#39;t doing</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.760" end="01:31:55.730" style="s2">their thing and that&#39;s what we really</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.320" end="01:31:58.300" style="s2">want to try to do as our response to all</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.730" end="01:32:01.220" style="s2">of this social justice craz crazy</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.300" end="01:32:04.100" style="s2">leftist stuff you know you mentioned the</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.220" end="01:32:05.780" style="s2">word localism and you know I&#39;m just just</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.100" end="01:32:07.070" style="s2">beginning to explore that subject in</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.780" end="01:32:10.030" style="s2">fact I&#39;m going to be talking to Joe</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.070" end="01:32:12.620" style="s2">Norman about that in a couple weeks and</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.030" end="01:32:14.249" style="s2">my understanding or at least our</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.620" end="01:32:18.210" style="s2">intention with the liminal or</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.249" end="01:32:21.210" style="s2">is we want to fight this fight from the</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.210" end="01:32:24.510" style="s2">ground up we want to put down roots and</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.210" end="01:32:27.179" style="s2">build a community that focuses on and is</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.510" end="01:32:30.690" style="s2">gathered around ideas of positive</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.179" end="01:32:33.499" style="s2">masculinity and and the way that we are</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.690" end="01:32:37.280" style="s2">formulating our response to culture war</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.499" end="01:32:40.860" style="s2">is not by writing policy papers or</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.280" end="01:32:43.499" style="s2">protesting or trolling people online or</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.860" end="01:32:47.280" style="s2">whatever now our approach is to build</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.499" end="01:32:50.190" style="s2">community and relationships start by</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.280" end="01:32:53.039" style="s2">focusing on improving ourselves become</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.190" end="01:32:55.739" style="s2">capable of being leaders then lead our</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.039" end="01:32:59.190" style="s2">families and then if we can do that we</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.739" end="01:33:01.139" style="s2">can help lead our communities and then</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.190" end="01:33:02.940" style="s2">if we&#39;re capable of doing that then</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.139" end="01:33:05.670" style="s2">maybe we can end up leading the nation</p>
<p begin="01:33:02.940" end="01:33:08.369" style="s2">and so that&#39;s basically the general gist</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.670" end="01:33:10.440" style="s2">of what the limo order is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.369" end="01:33:12.449" style="s2">community of men who believe in the</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.440" end="01:33:13.889" style="s2">power of masculinity and understand that</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.449" end="01:33:16.530" style="s2">in order to change the world we have to</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.889" end="01:33:18.539" style="s2">change ourselves and we can do that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.530" end="01:33:20.039" style="s2">then we can change our families and our</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.539" end="01:33:23.429" style="s2">families lead our communities and</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.039" end="01:33:25.679" style="s2">hopefully eventually either change the</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.429" end="01:33:28.050" style="s2">nation lead the nation or be what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.679" end="01:33:31.050" style="s2">standing when everything else comes</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.050" end="01:33:33.300" style="s2">crashing down around us and the thesis</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.050" end="01:33:36.659" style="s2">for the limo order has been proven in</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.300" end="01:33:38.130" style="s2">that when people of like-minded interest</p>
<p begin="01:33:36.659" end="01:33:41.820" style="s2">get together they can become happier</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.130" end="01:33:44.099" style="s2">healthier and wealthier and safer that</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.820" end="01:33:45.900" style="s2">has been proven and we combine the old</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.099" end="01:33:49.170" style="s2">sense of communities with the nuisance</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.900" end="01:33:51.150" style="s2">of network sense making then you have a</p>
<p begin="01:33:49.170" end="01:33:52.650" style="s2">hybrid product which is us which is</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.150" end="01:33:55.619" style="s2">Illumina order you know we&#39;re an old</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.650" end="01:33:57.989" style="s2">old-style community in the sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.619" end="01:33:59.639" style="s2">like Mutual Aid Society we help each</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.989" end="01:34:01.710" style="s2">other when we&#39;re in crisis we do</p>
<p begin="01:33:59.639" end="01:34:04.769" style="s2">professional networking personal</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.710" end="01:34:06.300" style="s2">development social events we have</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.769" end="01:34:08.579" style="s2">in-person meetings we&#39;ve had in person</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.300" end="01:34:11.099" style="s2">meetings that I think almost nine cities</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.579" end="01:34:14.719" style="s2">across the country now and then we</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.099" end="01:34:18.749" style="s2">combine that with network sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.719" end="01:34:21.239" style="s2">and perception and discernment and so</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.749" end="01:34:23.789" style="s2">we&#39;re both an old-line community plus a</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.239" end="01:34:25.260" style="s2">21st century since making apparatus that</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.789" end="01:34:27.160" style="s2">has allowed us to be ahead of the curve</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.260" end="01:34:29.380" style="s2">on things like kovat and Corona</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.160" end="01:34:32.380" style="s2">we knew that there was going to be a</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.380" end="01:34:33.790" style="s2">total shutdown meat shortages all these</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.380" end="01:34:36.730" style="s2">things that are happening now we knew</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.790" end="01:34:38.740" style="s2">back in January we put out a position</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.730" end="01:34:40.590" style="s2">paper in the middle of February it&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.740" end="01:34:44.410" style="s2">our members warning them to get prepared</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.590" end="01:34:47.680" style="s2">warning them to stock up on meats or get</p>

<p begin="01:34:47.680" end="01:34:52.150" style="s2">of things but basically just be prepared</p>
<p begin="01:34:49.800" end="01:34:54.040" style="s2">and you know some of our members</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.150" end="01:34:54.850" style="s2">families said they report to us that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.040" end="01:34:57.490" style="s2">their families thought that they were</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.850" end="01:34:59.200" style="s2">crazy but then a few weeks go by and all</p>

<p begin="01:34:59.200" end="01:35:03.850" style="s2">advanced knowledge of what was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.580" end="01:35:04.960" style="s2">happen so that&#39;s our response all of</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.850" end="01:35:07.510" style="s2">these things are tied together that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.960" end="01:35:10.300" style="s2">why that essay is on my website that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.510" end="01:35:12.130" style="s2">why my book is congruent with the work</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.300" end="01:35:13.630" style="s2">that I&#39;m doing the limo order that I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:35:15.970" end="01:35:21.190" style="s2">together I&#39;m tired of people whining</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.610" end="01:35:23.830" style="s2">about shit on social media policy papers</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.190" end="01:35:26.140" style="s2">are totally ineffective revenge is not</p>

<p begin="01:35:26.140" end="01:35:30.790" style="s2">that the smart and only rational thing</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.570" end="01:35:32.260" style="s2">to do is to build a community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.790" end="01:35:35.230" style="s2">based around the values that I hold</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.260" end="01:35:37.900" style="s2">important to frame it and to gear it up</p>

<p begin="01:35:37.900" end="01:35:41.170" style="s2">live the best lives that we possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.580" end="01:35:42.760" style="s2">so that we can build a community that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:35:49.120" end="01:35:52.750" style="s2">you and I talked to think is coming in</p>
<p begin="01:35:50.710" end="01:35:54.910" style="s2">the next few years here then maybe we</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.750" end="01:35:56.980" style="s2">will be an entity that is left standing</p>

<p begin="01:36:00.580" end="01:36:05.860" style="s2">I believe everything that I say</p>
