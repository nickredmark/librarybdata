<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">so the format of this event is going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">be like many of the other stone events</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:15.320" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do about half an hour of</p>

<p begin="00:01:15.320" end="00:01:20.720" style="s2">contextualize this project</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.759" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">and talk about our own experiences kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.720" end="00:01:25.840" style="s2">of coming into our</p>

<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">create this this idea of the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.079" end="00:01:58.000" style="s2">queen</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">series here at the stoa hi</p>

<p begin="00:02:01.600" end="00:02:06.880" style="s2">i was inspired to write the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">queen manifesto initially</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.880" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">because i noticed there was a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">current or perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">an old current that was resurfacing</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:21.200" style="s2">of a divine feminine nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">that was very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">a bit dark according to some yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">in need of exploration</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:35.280" style="s2">and i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:38.480" style="s2">bring forth this archetype or resurface</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.280" end="00:02:39.840" style="s2">this archetype so we could discuss what</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.480" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">was happening</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.840" end="00:02:44.879" style="s2">and i dubbed us the philosopher queens</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:47.920" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.879" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">not tradwives um but we&#39;re also not</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.920" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">social justice</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">activists we&#39;re femme fatales we</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:58.080" style="s2">occupy an interesting space and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">i believe it&#39;s time for us to explore</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.080" end="00:03:00.800" style="s2">this space</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:07.519" style="s2">great i&#39;m gonna just read um a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">bit of the philosopher queen manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.519" end="00:03:10.959" style="s2">uh just to contextualize what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:12.319" style="s2">talking about here i&#39;ve threw the link</p>

<p begin="00:03:12.319" end="00:03:15.760" style="s2">to look at um the medium post that kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.959" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">of outlines</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.760" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">rachel&#39;s thinking it&#39;s right there so</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:23.040" style="s2">i love that you begin with camille</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:23.440" style="s2">paulia so i&#39;ll be right up front about</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.040" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.440" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">influences here i&#39;m currently reading uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">sexual personae</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">uh which is the magnum opus of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:34.879" style="s2">heretical feminist camille paglia</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:36.640" style="s2">and um i would have to admit that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.879" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">of my views as a feminist</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.640" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">um come from her and she is a very</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:42.720" style="s2">controversial figure within the world of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:45.760" style="s2">feminism and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.720" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of partially what uh rachel</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.760" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:52.319" style="s2">are drawing from which is her lineage</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">um her lineage which is very primarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.319" end="00:03:56.000" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">the great mother and these like dark</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">qualities of the feminine that are often</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:04.319" style="s2">kind of pasted over with these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:04.959" style="s2">that have um kind of persisted of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.319" end="00:04:07.680" style="s2">purity</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.959" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">or kind of the virginal aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.680" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:11.680" style="s2">so the beginning of the philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">queen manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.680" end="00:04:14.799" style="s2">begins with the greatest philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:17.600" style="s2">queen herself</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.799" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">camille paglia once said that there is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.600" end="00:04:20.479" style="s2">no female mozart</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">because there is no female jack the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.479" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">ripper i posit that by the same token</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:27.440" style="s2">there is no male sylvia plath because</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.759" style="s2">there is no male courtney love</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.440" end="00:04:30.639" style="s2">gender comes in cycles and that which we</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.759" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">do not reveal</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.639" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">becomes that which the world desires</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">along this line of reasoning there is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">female equivalent to the hell&#39;s angels</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:40.960" style="s2">and if we join a gang like the hell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">angels as an obscure</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.960" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">gesture of folklore this is quite</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">different from an intellectual pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">we are out in the wild attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">investigate to domesticate ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">into the feminized society we feel too</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.680" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">masculine for</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">yet we yet are we really that masculine</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">or are we simply not the plastic healing</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">goddesses we are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:07.280" style="s2">on instagram categories such as hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:08.240" style="s2">boss girl and social justice activist do</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.280" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">not define us</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.240" end="00:05:12.960" style="s2">and never could contain us we were not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:14.320" style="s2">second wave feminists and we were not</p>

<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">crashed the oceans of our desires</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.919" end="00:05:23.440" style="s2">this is fine and this is natural and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">this is what is going on here</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.440" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">it is time for us to come forward and</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">define ourselves once again</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:30.560" style="s2">as our previously obscured current is</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:33.120" style="s2">beginning to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.560" end="00:05:33.919" style="s2">shape let us reveal only half of that</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">and admit that even half of that is too</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">we are the philosopher queens or pardon</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">rachel so there&#39;s some like metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.360" end="00:06:14.400" style="s2">terms that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve already kind of began to use which</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.400" end="00:06:19.280" style="s2">i think would be worth</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">discussing um we</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.280" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">talked about the you have the sonic in</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">can you tell me a little bit about what</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">the sonic means to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">yes it&#39;s the deep it&#39;s the obscured</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the hidden the forbidden the taboo</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">healing goddesses the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.639" end="00:06:51.199" style="s2">the chakra police if i did some</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">names for them um but um a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.199" end="00:06:55.039" style="s2">origin is</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">in the root of cthulhu you know like um</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.039" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">camille talks about</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:06:59.520" style="s2">the forbidden zone i don&#39;t know if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">guys saw the</p>

<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">on similar themes and</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">there was a dark goddess philosopher</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">who was one of the main characters in</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">the forbidden zone and it talks about</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.800" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">this mystical force of the this chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:20.800" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">yeah so the so the phonic you know is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">like the bowels of the earth right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:29.919" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">in the metaphysics that camille charts</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.919" end="00:07:32.400" style="s2">out in her book sexual personae you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.400" end="00:07:39.440" style="s2">ability which is associated with reason</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">and delight and order and purity</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.440" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">kind of exemplified in the art of greek</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">culture for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">the kind of beautiful beautiful boy</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">in a kind of contemplative way with</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">sharp delineated edges right these are</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">the kinds of textures of the apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:58.639" style="s2">it&#39;s also associated with masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">and the dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.639" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">is that which the apollonian is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">attempting to run away from</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:05.680" style="s2">the dionysian has the qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">murkiness</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.680" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">there&#39;s like it&#39;s muddy it&#39;s it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">all of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">um like disgusting</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.120" style="s2">kind of qualities to it and but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:19.840" style="s2">also the place where</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.120" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">we celebrate and we we go into kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.840" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">hysterical frenzy we go into</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">um religious experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:31.759" style="s2">have these kind of mind-altering moments</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">of singularity and the phonic is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.759" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">element of the dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">and is that which is the most kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">renegaded to to the bowels of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:44.080" style="s2">that which is hidden</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an element of this that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.080" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">just on a personal level it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">like why would these abstractions be</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.080" style="s2">like why is it helpful to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">apollonian as masculine or the or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.080" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">dionysian is feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">i&#39;ve had lots of conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">friends of mine who kind of push back on</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">this idea that there is any</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">necessity in like making these male or</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">female</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:08.959" style="s2">qualities but for me it&#39;s actually been</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">extremely helpful to kind of come to</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.959" end="00:09:12.560" style="s2">terms with the dark feminine in my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:15.600" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.560" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">and to admit to that which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.600" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">uh dark and powerful there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.640" style="s2">sense of which the</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">the female as a victim as some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:29.839" style="s2">pure force that is uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:32.880" style="s2">passive and things come to her</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.839" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">and in that metaphysics you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.880" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">not necessarily responsible for that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.760" style="s2">which she does</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">and the element of the dark mother</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.760" end="00:09:42.959" style="s2">the great mother is that of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.959" end="00:09:48.320" style="s2">the mother who eats her own children</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">you know who has a kind of power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.320" end="00:09:53.519" style="s2">charged by the bowels of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">and this is seen in at least in paulia</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.519" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:59.920" style="s2">nature you know the apollonian is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.680" style="s2">force that turns away from nature</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.920" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">and so we have this kind of tension or</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.680" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">this conflict between the circular the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">recurrence</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">that which repeats itself from one</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">generation to the next</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">that which is the mother to the daughter</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:14.320" style="s2">who becomes the mother</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">who then gives birth to the daughter and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.320" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">as that continues on and on</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:19.680" style="s2">um and then you have the apollonian</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">which attempts to differentiate itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.680" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">and that is difference</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">so you can also see it within a delusion</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">sense which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">difference in repetition which is one of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">his most influential books</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">um the dionysian is the repetition</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">and the difference is the apollonian um</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">and this is all metaphysics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">you&#39;re here for philosopher queens um so</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:44.640" style="s2">um pardon if if the if the philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">kind of a lot to take in but</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.640" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">uh both rachel and i are you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">drenched</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">in in metaphysics and in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:56.640" style="s2">and um that&#39;s part of my interest here</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">and and for both of us too we want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.640" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">bring in</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">women who are specifically philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">who are working through these ideas who</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:03.920" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">confronting some of these dark elements</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.920" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">that i think um</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">both of us maybe share different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">of critiques of feminism but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">this idea of like the pure goddess</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">um who&#39;s like kind of this perfect form</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:18.640" style="s2">who has no</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">evil to her i think is a reduction of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.640" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">femininity</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.760" style="s2">and rachel i think that you share that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">view as well</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.760" end="00:11:30.320" style="s2">um yeah i really do because</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:31.519" style="s2">people think about the disney princess</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.320" end="00:11:34.240" style="s2">and then they think about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">disney villain you have ariel on one</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.240" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">spectrum and then you have ursula</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">on the other end of the spectrum but in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">the manifesto we say well what if ursula</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:45.200" style="s2">was hot yeah you know what what if there</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.279" style="s2">was a synthesis</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.200" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">you know but what if the the celebration</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.279" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">of life this this chaos this nature</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:57.200" style="s2">it was about the roots the origin</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:59.040" style="s2">the mother the giving birth to uh new</p>

<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.839" style="s2">something to shun you know um what if</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">this was a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.839" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">powerful force that we were only just</p>

<p begin="00:12:38.560" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">my question is what are we going to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">with this energy what what can we</p>

<p begin="00:12:55.680" end="00:13:00.079" style="s2">and i was having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.920" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">raven earlier where she was telling me</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.079" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">about this trip that she had and i i</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">would love</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">for you raven to get into this because</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:08.800" style="s2">it just sounded</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">really groundbreaking from what you were</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.800" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">telling me</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:17.279" style="s2">yeah thanks for the question rachel um</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">so yeah this weekend i went on a camping</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.279" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">trip</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">and took two doses of acid and ended up</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">having a very archetypal experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:29.279" style="s2">um and it i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.880" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s a variety of kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.279" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">of experiences that people have on acid</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.880" end="00:13:36.380" style="s2">but i have a tendency to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">um you know time begins to</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.380" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">phase in from multiple aspects of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">life and so i was</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">i was kind of walking through a time</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">that was both my time as a child as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">little girl</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:54.399" style="s2">and also my like experience of my mother</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:56.000" style="s2">um who for me there&#39;s a kind of special</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.399" end="00:13:58.399" style="s2">relationship that i have with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.000" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">because she passed away when i was 19.</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.399" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">and so there&#39;s always this this attempt</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:04.639" style="s2">to reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:05.600" style="s2">or to empathize with her with her as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.639" end="00:14:08.560" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.600" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">um because i have this absence of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">mother figure in my life</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:16.320" style="s2">and so i i had this moment where i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">climbing up these these boulders up to</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">the top of a mountain</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">and the sun was pouring down upon me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">there was a moment of which i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:26.959" style="s2">looking at my body and i look like my</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:29.440" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.959" end="00:14:31.120" style="s2">i have her body and i have her face and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.440" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">i have her being and i was looking at my</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.120" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">hands</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.240" end="00:14:38.800" style="s2">and i had this singularity where i</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:39.680" style="s2">felt that i was my mother and i was also</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.800" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.680" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">and i was also a sister and i was also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:46.560" style="s2">daughter and i was also a lover and it</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">was all happening in a single moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.560" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">and i like broke down behind the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:54.240" style="s2">boulders and started kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">sobbing in this uh hysteria of of this</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.240" end="00:14:57.440" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.480" style="s2">and for the rest of the trip i i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">like in i was</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.480" end="00:15:05.440" style="s2">occupying this the space</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">of multiple modalities</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.440" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">and to me this was like peak dionysian</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">right it was like it was an embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">of this like property of of like female</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.160" style="s2">existence which alexander bard talks</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:20.560" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.160" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">um which is the mother and the daughter</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.560" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">are not different</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t need to be different</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:26.000" style="s2">if anything there&#39;s actually a danger in</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">their difference</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.000" end="00:15:29.920" style="s2">that they may not pass down that which</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">has been learned</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.920" end="00:15:33.440" style="s2">from the female line and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:36.639" style="s2">kind of sameness</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.440" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">that exists within femininity um</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.639" end="00:15:41.600" style="s2">and then that to be kind of embodied in</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">my experience and how i was relating to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.600" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">all the people around me</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">you know as as this mother figure i was</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">reading out loud</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">and you know i had a friend put her head</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.399" style="s2">on my chest</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:53.360" style="s2">and i was thinking about how as a child</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.399" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">i put my head</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.360" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">on my mother&#39;s chest and heard the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.120" style="s2">vibrations</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">of her body as she read to me and i</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.120" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">thought about myself</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">teaching my own child how to read and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">then i thought about all the women</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">who&#39;ve taught their children how to read</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">you know so there&#39;s this kind of there</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:12.000" style="s2">was this ricocheting of empathy that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">rooted in all of these different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.000" end="00:16:15.680" style="s2">of the feminine experience that was</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">happening kind of in the singular</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.680" end="00:16:19.680" style="s2">moments</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.959" style="s2">um that i was going along with with all</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.680" end="00:16:23.600" style="s2">of these trips</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.959" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">and some of the i mean i&#39;m still kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.600" end="00:16:27.199" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">um in the wake of this experience and of</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.199" end="00:16:31.519" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:33.920" style="s2">there were also other kinds of um</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.519" end="00:16:35.680" style="s2">little tiny dramas that happened um that</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.920" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">would we could blow up and maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.680" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">analysis of but i think you know i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:40.240" style="s2">that this is sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:42.399" style="s2">um to kind of talk about this point</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.240" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">which is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.399" end="00:16:49.279" style="s2">inside of the feminine experience is</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:51.920" style="s2">these multiple dimensions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.279" end="00:16:53.440" style="s2">you know the the try the triad of the of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.920" end="00:16:55.040" style="s2">the feminine the maiden and the mother</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.440" end="00:16:57.839" style="s2">and the crone you know is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.040" end="00:16:58.959" style="s2">um ubiquitous understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.839" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">femaleness and</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">i think that this really uh at least in</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">this moment really resonated with me</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">in the sense that i could feel myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">being all of these things simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a kind of strangeness</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">because there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:13.600" style="s2">and i think rachel you can totally</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:15.280" style="s2">identify with this as well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.600" end="00:17:17.919" style="s2">aspects of myself that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.280" end="00:17:18.480" style="s2">i consider to be very masculine so</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.919" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.480" end="00:17:22.319" style="s2">there&#39;s like an attempt to synthesize to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">exist with and</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.319" end="00:17:27.919" style="s2">really embody this this you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">um the singularity of the female</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.919" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">experience and to put it front and</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:34.080" style="s2">center you know for me i i like heavily</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">identify with motherhood</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.080" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">it is the most important thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:41.679" style="s2">that i think i can do in my life is to</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:43.280" style="s2">like have a child and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.679" end="00:17:45.360" style="s2">that&#39;s not something that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.280" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">believes of my generation and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.360" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">prescribing it for anybody else but for</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">me that is like a central value</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:54.720" style="s2">and it pushes me forward into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.559" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">it makes me look at the things about</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.720" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">myself that i need</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:00.240" style="s2">in order to grow in order to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">responsibility for someone else and for</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.240" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">someone else&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">and it also has me empathize with my own</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">mother who</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:08.400" style="s2">i basically can only access through</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">these these</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.400" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">thought experiments um because of her</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">absence in my existence</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">but at the same time there&#39;s all of this</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">of being a woman now that hadn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:23.440" style="s2">available to women before</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">that you can walk in the world of men</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.440" end="00:18:26.640" style="s2">and also be a mother</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:27.840" style="s2">you know whereas in the in the history</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.640" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">it would have been if you were to walk</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.840" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">in the world of men you were a</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.480" style="s2">prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">there weren&#39;t really these types of</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.480" end="00:18:35.840" style="s2">fluid roles</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">um and so there&#39;s a sense of which i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.840" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">grappling with this</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.400" style="s2">synthesis of these qualities the desire</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">to take on</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.400" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">you know deeply this like role of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">feminine that is like an inherited fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">being of this female lineage but also to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:55.280" style="s2">engage in the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2">of the masculinization of society and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.280" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">the democratization of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">that we now have as as women</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.400" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">yeah i i would echo that sentiment and</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.240" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve developed a deep respect for</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">motherhood as someone who can bring a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:17.120" style="s2">background where people were</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">kind of like against you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:20.799" style="s2">traditional family you know hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.120" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">in a lot of more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">goth subcultures um which embodied</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.320" style="s2">the dark goddess which embodied the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:31.360" style="s2">mother figure</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">but at the same time that they were very</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.360" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">against having kids so i&#39;m kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.080" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">come full circle and having talked to</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.080" end="00:19:42.400" style="s2">a lot more mothers and women who want to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:45.679" style="s2">be mothers i&#39;m beginning to see</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.400" end="00:19:47.600" style="s2">how it all connects and how it is all a</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.679" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">part of the same lineage even if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.600" end="00:19:51.280" style="s2">think about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:53.360" style="s2">different archetypes like kalimata</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.280" end="00:19:55.120" style="s2">goddess of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.360" end="00:19:57.039" style="s2">the goddess of destruction um but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.120" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">question is like what happened after</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.039" end="00:20:03.679" style="s2">the destruction or rebirth um aphrodite</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">we have all of these different</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.679" end="00:20:08.080" style="s2">archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">of women and the question is</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.080" end="00:20:14.640" style="s2">do we embody all of them how</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">do we understand our lineage</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.640" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">as women from different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.120" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">with different backgrounds with with</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">different ideas</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:28.320" style="s2">um and operating in the world of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">masculine is is definitely something</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.320" end="00:20:31.600" style="s2">that i&#39;m familiar with having</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:32.720" style="s2">been involved in a lot of male</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.600" end="00:20:35.840" style="s2">industries and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.720" end="00:20:36.720" style="s2">everything from technology to politics</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.840" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.720" end="00:20:42.159" style="s2">and i did notice that there was a lack</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">of a female presence in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">worlds um</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">because women didn&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:49.919" style="s2">perceived</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:53.360" style="s2">as masculine um which</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.919" end="00:20:56.640" style="s2">i think is kind of reductionist because</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.360" end="00:21:00.000" style="s2">it is possible to embody masculine</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.640" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">traits and be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.000" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">divine philosopher queen you know i&#39;m to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">turn it back to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">philosopher queen theme um that that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">okay we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">embody the masculinity and not breathe</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.039" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">in this world of men while</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">still being a part of this lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">powerful divinity and i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">there&#39;s necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:24.559" style="s2">a contradiction in that and i know there</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:28.559" style="s2">are a lot of women who feel</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.559" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">you know i&#39;m well i&#39;m not trapped enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.559" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not feminine enough i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">masculine enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:40.400" style="s2">but what is like like you are you</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">you are a woman you have that internal</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.400" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">you are a part of this lineage and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.000" style="s2">you should simply be</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.200" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">yeah i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.320" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">i think i i both i completely understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying like there&#39;s no need</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">to like to see oneself as in lack</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">right like to see oneself is needing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">kind of either be more feminine or more</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">masculine to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:09.919" style="s2">fabricate oneself based on a sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">of what one ought to be right like i</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.919" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">absolutely a kind of fallacy in that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:18.080" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">there is some kind of strangeness and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.080" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">course people debate this and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">paulia has a famous quote one of her</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:25.440" style="s2">most controversial that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">you know if civilization had been left</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.440" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">up to women we&#39;d all be living in</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">grass huts um and i i mean i love it i</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">love that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">like i i guess for me it&#39;s um the idea</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:37.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">philosophy is a male pursuit or civil</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.600" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">the building of civilization has been a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">male pursuit that it has been</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">actually um an an act of terraforming</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:51.120" style="s2">that comes of the male</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">um impulse to turn away</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.120" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">from the feminine to turn away from</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">um i don&#39;t find anything wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:00.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">i think that&#39;s that&#39;s a very paulian</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:04.799" style="s2">thing i mean she</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.600" end="00:23:06.799" style="s2">she is like interested in the riches of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.799" end="00:23:07.280" style="s2">culture which are often attributed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.799" end="00:23:09.919" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.280" end="00:23:12.480" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a way in which this this</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.919" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">like amazonian feminism that she</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.480" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">uh she prophetizes is not afraid</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">of the existence of masculinity or the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">riches of masculinity that which has</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:23.760" style="s2">brought</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:25.039" style="s2">great culture and and great literature</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.760" end="00:23:28.320" style="s2">and great philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.039" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">and political theory into the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.320" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">and i follow in that in the line of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">but what follows also from that is a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">kind of understanding that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">femaleness that i am</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">is not that which is exclusively created</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">by femininity</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">but has been also what men</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:50.400" style="s2">have created the</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">stories men have told about women and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.400" end="00:23:53.760" style="s2">how sexual personae have actually been</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">produced through the likes of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.760" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">shakespeare right like shakespeare</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.279" style="s2">wrote these characters of femininity</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:01.120" style="s2">that really um</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.279" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">you know someone like rosalind from as</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.120" end="00:24:04.240" style="s2">you like it or cleopatra from anthony</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:06.720" style="s2">and cleopatra</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.240" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">these characters that were so rich and</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.720" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">full of emotion</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">um that actually occupied roles that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">women in society of that day</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.159" style="s2">would have not had the opportunity to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:18.559" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.159" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">and that sits in the consciousness it</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.559" end="00:24:24.080" style="s2">makes an imprintation on reality</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.360" style="s2">um and it carves out the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.080" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">an alternative way</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.360" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">for for women and i think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">chart this throughout</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">um the western lineage where like the i</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:35.760" style="s2">the notions of being female have</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:38.559" style="s2">actually been notions</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.760" end="00:24:39.679" style="s2">that men have written in many cases and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.559" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t until</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.679" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">um you know a couple hundred years ago</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">that we that women were given the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">opportunity to write about their own</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:48.000" style="s2">experiences um</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:49.279" style="s2">and in that sense they were also doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.000" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">something that was considered to be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.279" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">male pursuit</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s so much complexity in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.320" style="s2">in terms of the dynamics between male</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">and female and the preservation of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.320" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">polarity i think allows</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:06.000" style="s2">for the tension to kind of persist</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s also these these</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.440" style="s2">people in between and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">actually that is who the artists have</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.440" end="00:25:13.840" style="s2">been um you know the male artists</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">who who predate who produce great works</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.840" end="00:25:17.760" style="s2">of literature</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:19.600" style="s2">often were kind of androgen and same</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.760" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">with i think rachel and i we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.600" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">actually occupy the space of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">androgen um</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:29.279" style="s2">and in that space you move between roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">you actually explore the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.279" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">being that which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:35.679" style="s2">not poll polarized um</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:37.440" style="s2">but you still don&#39;t i mean i think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.679" end="00:25:40.559" style="s2">the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.440" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">maybe the metaphysics of of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">paulia or some of these other folks is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:47.360" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a desire i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">in contemporary thought especially the</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.360" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">pop cultural kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">to devour the polarity we we want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">cannibalize it we want it to basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">made completely horizontal um</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.960" end="00:26:02.880" style="s2">so that the mixing all that exists is</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:04.320" style="s2">the dyneesian at this point you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.880" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">just like the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.320" end="00:26:07.520" style="s2">of of things kind of the flatness of</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:10.880" style="s2">things the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.520" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">delusion plateau let&#39;s say um but i</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.880" end="00:26:14.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:17.279" style="s2">you know in acceptance with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.799" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">the apollonian is like no the polarities</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.279" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">are actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">not only are they uh you know functional</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:24.159" style="s2">they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:25.840" style="s2">real you know there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.159" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">these polarities exist</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.840" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">um as as categories transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:35.440" style="s2">categories that have</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">um real kind of attributes</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.440" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">in reality and when we don&#39;t look at</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:40.799" style="s2">them they come for us i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">actually part of the thing it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.799" end="00:26:44.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t look</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">and you don&#39;t consider the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.240" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">and her devouring nature</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.520" style="s2">she&#39;ll come for you she&#39;ll come for you</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:51.760" style="s2">and she&#39;ll eat you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.520" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like and i think that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">you can see that in your manifesto right</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">you talk about the half that is revealed</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">that half that is concealed</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">the hat that is concealed if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">account for that if you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">that like this is the person who reveals</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.880" style="s2">yourself only half</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.400" style="s2">and a half you don&#39;t account for that</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.880" end="00:27:10.159" style="s2">that which you cannot see</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.400" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">it eventually it will come for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.159" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">because you&#39;ve reduced the person</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">to only this kind of pure pure element</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">maybe the trad element or whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.360" end="00:27:22.240" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually see</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:26.399" style="s2">this this sonic element that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.240" end="00:27:28.720" style="s2">is actually kind of where the power lies</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.399" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly where the power lies i</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.720" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">think of a show true blood</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:35.600" style="s2">where there was this character mary ann</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">she was a main ad</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.600" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s the proper</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">pronunciation where she</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">devoured everything that was in her path</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">and it turned out that she was acting on</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.559" style="s2">this very</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">natural primal impulse</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.559" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">talking about this primal instinctive</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:53.520" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">that a lot of the characters in true</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.520" end="00:27:56.880" style="s2">blood weren&#39;t able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">grapple with um and you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.880" end="00:28:00.399" style="s2">they they villainized her</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">um but if you really think about it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.399" end="00:28:04.159" style="s2">these are the women who have</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">changed history these are the women i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.159" end="00:28:08.720" style="s2">in between the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">female the androgen as soon as alexander</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:15.039" style="s2">would call it the end androgyny</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">or something and georgia i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.039" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">pronounce it um but yeah he has the word</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">for this um where it&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:19.760" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">and between the male and the female</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.760" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">girls and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:25.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very crucial because</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:28.559" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">polarized with gender right now um</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.559" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">and i i think there&#39;s like this desire</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">for i guess you could call it on like</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:39.200" style="s2">frivolity</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">or insincerity that a lot of women are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.200" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">adapting you know where everything has</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:46.240" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">like some un serious you know me</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.240" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">and more or joke um and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">other side</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">which is like the the hashtag self-care</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">activists</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.080" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s important that we look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">other opportunities um other forms</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:09.679" style="s2">and other archetypes and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:13.279" style="s2">the history of this current um</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.679" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">where it came from where it is now and</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.279" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">where he&#39;s going i think back to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:20.480" style="s2">xena the princess warrior and</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">how incredible xena the princess warrior</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">and then wonder woman came out like 15</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.039" style="s2">years later</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:29.120" style="s2">and i&#39;m like well this is kind of boring</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.039" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">why do we need wonder woman</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.120" end="00:29:32.320" style="s2">when we have xena you know i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:34.399" style="s2">seemed to me like</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.320" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">like a regression i&#39;m not meant to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.399" end="00:29:38.799" style="s2">off into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">a pop culture tangent um that where</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.799" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">are the bad amazon chicks right um so</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be explored</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:49.679" style="s2">in this realm and i encourage everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:52.799" style="s2">here</p>

<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a strong observation i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">just an observation i</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:07.919" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t go so far to say it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.279" style="s2">critique but there&#39;s an observation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.919" end="00:30:12.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a pretty heavily</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.279" end="00:30:12.720" style="s2">heavy skew um towards men rather than</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.080" end="00:30:14.159" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.720" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">and so this is the you&#39;re right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.159" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">racking my brains like why is this the</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">right and i think like the initial like</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">for me i</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:24.960" style="s2">i am not really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">accusations of misogyny or sexism</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.960" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">um that is not the first thing that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:28.960" style="s2">going to look at i think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.960" end="00:30:32.320" style="s2">a um knee-jerk reaction and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.320" end="00:30:37.039" style="s2">if it if there is a case of misogyny or</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:38.640" style="s2">sexism which i have personally not</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.039" end="00:30:42.159" style="s2">experienced here at all</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.640" end="00:30:43.679" style="s2">um to to make that be your kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.159" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">declaration of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.679" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">i think is also to obscure maybe some of</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">the underlying dynamics that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:52.240" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:55.679" style="s2">excuse to begin with and of course this</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.240" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">you know this um series is an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.679" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:02.399" style="s2">and attract this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:03.360" style="s2">attract other women and i think part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.399" end="00:31:05.200" style="s2">it is like</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.360" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">we&#39;re so distributed and all these other</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.200" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">groups you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">and uh there are just fewer women who</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:11.679" style="s2">are interested</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">in in philosophy let&#39;s say and so we</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.679" end="00:31:13.679" style="s2">have to kind of get them to congregate</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:15.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.679" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">i&#39;m hoping that this can be kind of part</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.440" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">of that right because</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">we we want to be together</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">um i feel such a longing for female</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:27.039" style="s2">relationship and i mean that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">why rachel it&#39;s just been such a gift</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.039" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">to get to know you over the course of of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">this year and to work with you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">and to have someone in my life that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">can share this type of</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">uh very you know abstract kind of niche</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.320" style="s2">you know interest and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">duluz and alexander bard and like all of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.320" end="00:31:45.919" style="s2">these like weird things that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">you know nobody else really knows about</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.919" end="00:31:50.159" style="s2">um to have someone like you</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">is uh it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a sister a</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.159" end="00:31:54.960" style="s2">sister in the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">um to move through this this territory</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.960" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:02.480" style="s2">um otherwise feels pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">uh isolating and i hope that we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.480" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">you know draw more uh women who are</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:09.840" style="s2">interested in these things</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">and yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.840" end="00:32:13.039" style="s2">that&#39;s so touching to me thank you so</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">accusation of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:07.039" style="s2">misogyny and yet we&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">conversation</p>

<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:21.919" style="s2">did was i grabbed my iching</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:25.480" style="s2">because uh what your conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.919" end="00:34:29.359" style="s2">alexander bard and temporality and er</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.480" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">temporalities uh especially intrigued me</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.359" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">i&#39;d love to hear you</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:34.079" style="s2">go back and forth a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.079" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">um what came up for me was the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">48th hexagram the well</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:47.599" style="s2">and uh the the inexhaustible</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">and i think that really relates to like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.599" end="00:34:53.919" style="s2">donald donna haraway&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:55.119" style="s2">and the sonic and various other themes</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.919" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">that you&#39;ve touched on</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.119" end="00:35:02.960" style="s2">so that that chaotic that depth</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">that inexhaustibility that temporality</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.960" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">um that&#39;s what is sparking in me right</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:10.400" style="s2">now i don&#39;t know if that was a question</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:13.280" style="s2">but i&#39;d love to just hear your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.400" end="00:35:13.680" style="s2">sure rachel do you have any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:17.200" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.680" end="00:35:19.680" style="s2">donna harway or the or oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.200" end="00:35:21.599" style="s2">oh my god so donna herrera was one of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.680" end="00:35:24.079" style="s2">big inspirations</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.599" end="00:35:25.839" style="s2">when i became a trans humanist i read</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.079" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">the cyborg manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.839" end="00:35:30.320" style="s2">and she was one of the first women to</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:30.720" style="s2">really go against identity politics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.320" end="00:35:33.280" style="s2">she</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.720" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about misogyny she didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.280" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">talk about victimhood she talked about</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:41.920" style="s2">how women were kind of stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">these human forms when we could be so</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">much more than that</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">and i i see donna harvey as a big</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.839" end="00:35:50.079" style="s2">inspiration for</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:51.280" style="s2">so much of the philosophy and so much of</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">this dialogue and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.280" end="00:35:55.920" style="s2">thank you for mentioning her</p>

<p begin="00:35:55.920" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">donna hairway so and i think that this</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">is maybe a kind of conversation we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:02.480" style="s2">i know that you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:04.800" style="s2">like really affiliated with</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.480" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">transhumanism but um there&#39;s a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.800" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">thing about transhumanism that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:12.960" style="s2">um you know the xeno feminists say</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">nature is unjust change nature right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.960" end="00:36:18.079" style="s2">so that kind of leads us to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">a conclusion of the alterations of our</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.079" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">bodies to kind of transcend</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:23.440" style="s2">the qualities of the feminine condition</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:25.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.440" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">the way that i would differentiate this</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.200" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">is that there&#39;s a female experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:32.560" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a female condition and</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:33.359" style="s2">that that is rooted in the biology of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.560" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.359" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">and i think the female experience is</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:40.720" style="s2">decoupled from the female body and to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:43.760" style="s2">that it kind of explains</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.720" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">transness as as a meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.760" end="00:36:48.560" style="s2">element of femininity but also the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:51.839" style="s2">condition of the female body</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.560" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">um as a as a womb you know as</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.839" end="00:36:58.800" style="s2">this entity that</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">human life incubates inside of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.800" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">um i think is something that</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:06.960" style="s2">donna and the xeno feminists rightfully</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">identify as tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.960" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a tyrannical force it is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.680" style="s2">condition it is something</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">that you have to endure and in that</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.680" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">sense i think that</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:17.920" style="s2">uh you can go two different ways with</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">this you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.920" end="00:37:21.280" style="s2">you can liberate yourself from that and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">that&#39;s like the kind of transhumanist</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.280" end="00:37:26.000" style="s2">roots that&#39;s his you know feminist root</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">that is like let us transform our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.000" end="00:37:30.960" style="s2">so that we may transcend</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">this condition or um i mean for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.960" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">i&#39;ve taken the root of embracing this</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">quality of my existence</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:39.040" style="s2">and um that&#39;s where the kind of mother</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">archetype comes in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">i take this incubator</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">as my own um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">that is like part of how i&#39;m developing</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">my um</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">understanding of the female condition as</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.000" style="s2">i move forward in my life and i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.000" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">uh it&#39;s an interesting thing the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">condition of birth</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:03.839" style="s2">and of incubation</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">as a feminine as a female experience you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.839" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:10.000" style="s2">is at the very least a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">necessary kind of empathy for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.000" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">condition of femininity</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">as it has been in the past um now</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:19.920" style="s2">of course we&#39;ve had a decoupling of sex</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">from reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.920" end="00:38:23.280" style="s2">and so we&#39;re kind of living in the wake</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">of this new era um where</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.280" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">sex is is not that which it has been</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">before it doesn&#39;t have the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.320" style="s2">risks it doesn&#39;t have the same kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.320" end="00:38:35.920" style="s2">like qualities to consequences to it and</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.920" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">this um i don&#39;t know this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">decoupling and the splitting and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:45.599" style="s2">technological intervention um</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">that allows for women to transcend their</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.599" end="00:38:49.040" style="s2">bodies i think is you know it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:50.880" style="s2">unprecedented and it creates these new</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.040" end="00:38:53.359" style="s2">you know the cyborg manifesto it creates</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.880" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">the possibility of this um</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.359" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">world of synthesizing with machines um</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:39:00.079" style="s2">that can</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:01.760" style="s2">for some women provide them an exit from</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.079" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">the female condition</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.760" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">um which some women are interested in uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">i personally am not i think i can go in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">a lot of directions um</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">and i see other kim singer recovering</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:17.920" style="s2">um yeah so transgenderism these days</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.320" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just about immortality</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.920" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">and i think there&#39;s so many more</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">possibilities than</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">immortality um i i would consider the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:27.839" style="s2">xeno-feminists to be post-humanist um</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:28.720" style="s2">even even future oh yeah that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.839" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.720" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">transitionism it&#39;s just like a a branch</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:34.320" style="s2">of public health right now like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about hostinism let&#39;s talk</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.320" end="00:39:37.599" style="s2">about xena feminism let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:40.800" style="s2">possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.599" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">the human body um not just about</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.800" end="00:39:45.200" style="s2">like transcending your body and like</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:48.079" style="s2">going up into the cloud and that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.200" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">enhancing our bodies in whatever way we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.079" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">want on whether</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">that&#39;s changing our gender to enhancing</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">our gender to becoming more feminine um</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">at the risk of um being uh someone who</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">has</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">unpopular views wouldn&#39;t want that right</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.000" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">um i think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">it&#39;s about so much more than like</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">being trans it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:16.800" style="s2">understanding the human condition</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">and reaching to higher metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.800" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">depths</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.599" end="00:40:23.119" style="s2">um perhaps you know you don&#39;t just want</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">to change your gender perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.119" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">want to become um you know like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">queen or somebody who can fly</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">um that there are so many possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:38.240" style="s2">when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">transcendence and futurism here and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.240" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">definitely don&#39;t want to conflate them</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">with the uh immortality cult because</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">completely different world yeah when we</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:50.480" style="s2">look into the future versus looking into</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:54.160" style="s2">the past there&#39;s very different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.480" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">possibilities there i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.160" end="00:40:58.960" style="s2">the post-human question um</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.640" style="s2">and like what that does for us as human</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.960" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.640" end="00:41:04.319" style="s2">i think is like a pretty important one</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">in terms of um</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.319" end="00:41:09.680" style="s2">contextualizing the human experience and</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that goes beyond</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.680" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">you know masculinity or femininity at</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.839" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">all i mean that is like</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:19.760" style="s2">that is kind of a biological quality</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:21.760" style="s2">um yeah so definitely i i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.760" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">right to say that it is post-humanist</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.760" end="00:41:29.839" style="s2">um thank you lisa for that provocation</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">really appreciated that i also love the</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:33.040" style="s2">idea of the well</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">do i wanna invite anybody else to ask</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.040" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">questions um you know we&#39;re here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">two brains</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">and we have things to say</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.880" end="00:41:42.400" style="s2">i&#39;ve got a question all right hi nice to</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">meet you guys</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.400" end="00:41:45.599" style="s2">and thanks for the event um i was</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">wondering if you could expand a little</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.599" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">bit more on the commentary around</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.240" style="s2">the great mother and specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">devouring aspect of the archetype being</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.240" end="00:41:55.839" style="s2">i think more of like the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:58.960" style="s2">power i believe you guys said um</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.839" end="00:41:59.920" style="s2">i think with my point of view i i see</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.960" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">the archetype</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.920" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">as a whole and that tonic element the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:05.920" style="s2">forgotten as</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.200" style="s2">more of a repressive element of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.920" end="00:42:08.880" style="s2">feminine something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.200" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">reclaimed and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.880" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">uh made uh sort of brought back</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">into the light and um a necessary sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">of darkness that that feminine element</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:22.480" style="s2">brings um sort of balances out the light</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:24.880" style="s2">element and kind of together they hold</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.480" end="00:42:26.560" style="s2">to me like the core of the power and</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.880" end="00:42:28.319" style="s2">you know just to throw it back a little</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.560" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">bit more to the comment about ursula</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.319" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">um i think like in her in her darkness</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">in her non-sexy hotness like she is</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">she&#39;s the baba yaga archetype she&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">devouring mother and she</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:42.319" style="s2">through those dark initiations she</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.160" style="s2">forces like the maiden to</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.319" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">to transcend to kind of go through</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.160" end="00:42:49.280" style="s2">psychic transformation and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">um the maiden kind of has her own power</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.280" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">in that case</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:55.359" style="s2">her her openness her trust um</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.319" style="s2">her naivety and it&#39;s kind of through the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.359" end="00:42:58.240" style="s2">bridging of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.319" end="00:43:00.319" style="s2">uh moments that the feminine really kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.240" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">of takes shape and takes hold so</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.319" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">anyways just wondering if you could</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">expand just a little bit more upon your</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.599" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">ideas around that</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">oh yeah thank you for that comment i</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">think that was an excellent way of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:13.760" style="s2">talking about because i mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:15.760" style="s2">bringing up an excellent point the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.760" end="00:43:17.359" style="s2">maiden has her own power</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.760" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">um i think that this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.359" end="00:43:23.599" style="s2">uh is absolutely critical for women to</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:26.640" style="s2">um address for themselves just on a</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.599" end="00:43:29.359" style="s2">like day-to-day basis um</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.640" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">for a long time i denied personally like</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.359" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">the power</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">of my own kind of youth and vitality</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">as a young beautiful woman and it</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">uh is a kind of denial that i see</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:43.280" style="s2">that&#39;s like weird it&#39;s like a weird kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">of self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.280" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">right it&#39;s like oh my god you can see</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">just like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:51.760" style="s2">the worship of these beautiful maiden</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:53.440" style="s2">figures this is everywhere it&#39;s like on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.760" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">the internet it&#39;s like everything i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.440" end="00:43:58.480" style="s2">everything is this made in worship</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">um and yet you know individually women</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.480" end="00:44:02.480" style="s2">i think don&#39;t necessarily kind of fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:04.960" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.480" end="00:44:07.520" style="s2">the implications of their power and of</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.960" end="00:44:10.720" style="s2">course the internet like exaggerates</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.520" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">this specific kind of power</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.720" end="00:44:16.319" style="s2">because it&#39;s so image oriented</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:17.760" style="s2">which is also the realm you know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.319" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">the maiden walks in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.760" end="00:44:25.520" style="s2">with such such great asymmetrical power</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">especially over men um so i think that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.520" end="00:44:30.240" style="s2">you&#39;re totally right to call out the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.280" style="s2">the power of the maiden i think the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.240" end="00:44:34.640" style="s2">funny thing about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.280" end="00:44:37.680" style="s2">um or i guess it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.640" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">uh unification of</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.680" end="00:44:42.640" style="s2">the maiden and the kind of baba yaga or</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">you know the great mother archetype</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.640" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">and some sort of tension because of</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:46.800" style="s2">course that&#39;s the other element of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.800" end="00:44:50.079" style="s2">you know women aren&#39;t some sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">monolith of of</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.079" end="00:44:55.359" style="s2">perfectly aligned figures there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">of conflict that happens between women</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.359" end="00:45:00.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s often conflict uh between</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">and you can see this like that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.000" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">story of snow white right so you have</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">the stepmother who is</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.040" style="s2">cool and evil and ugly and you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">obsessed with her own appearance and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.040" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">have this beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:13.440" style="s2">kind of uh this virgin character who</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">um she is jealous of so there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.440" end="00:45:18.160" style="s2">kind of these the tension</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">between these figures that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.160" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">creates creates these like dark</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">you know these kind of darker dynamics i</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">think for me</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">where where the great mother is such a</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">kind of yearning</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:33.839" style="s2">is the fact that it has been repressed</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">and then that repression it has a kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">of allure to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">um it it draws me in on a personal level</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:43.359" style="s2">and it also</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.520" end="00:45:45.119" style="s2">and i i mean i think honestly what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.359" end="00:45:47.680" style="s2">said is just so perfect because i would</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.119" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">consider myself to be in a maiden phase</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.680" end="00:45:52.880" style="s2">right i&#39;m like a young woman i&#39;m not yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:56.240" style="s2">mother i am not yet</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.880" end="00:45:57.440" style="s2">crohn but it is the confrontation with</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:45:59.520" style="s2">the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.440" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">of the great mother the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.520" end="00:46:03.920" style="s2">great mother that is forcing me</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:05.280" style="s2">to kind of reconcile with my own</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.920" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.280" end="00:46:10.240" style="s2">with with the things that i don&#39;t wish</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">to see about myself that are dark</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.240" end="00:46:13.440" style="s2">you know and the other thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:16.319" style="s2">think about this is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.440" end="00:46:18.560" style="s2">the acceptance of the great mother and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.319" end="00:46:21.920" style="s2">her kind of virtuality as a presence</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.560" end="00:46:22.480" style="s2">that can come along with you um in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.920" end="00:46:26.160" style="s2">eyes</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.480" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">is a gift because the devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.160" end="00:46:30.160" style="s2">is a real archetype i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">you know how everybody&#39;s relationships</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.160" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">with their mothers are but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:38.960" style="s2">total presence of a mother</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:40.960" style="s2">who smothers her children who</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.960" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">holds them close and does not let them</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.960" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">go even when they need to go</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">even when they need to be left even when</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">they need to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">cast away from the breast it&#39;s like get</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:50.960" style="s2">out of here go and differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:54.560" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.960" end="00:46:57.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s like totally um a pitfall</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.560" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">of the mother to hold her children close</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.760" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">and not let them become their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.920" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">and i see that as being kind of starting</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">to dance in this direction of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">devouring mother of embodying the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">and so the process of coming</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">in contact with the great mother</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">archetype i&#39;m seeing in myself</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:18.960" style="s2">that which could become the devouring</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:22.480" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.960" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">and to me that is like it&#39;s a gift to</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.480" end="00:47:26.160" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">a chance to work through those things</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">before i have children</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">so that that&#39;s kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.440" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">yeah my understanding of the matter and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">i really appreciate your comment</p>

<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">coming from which is that um all of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:57.119" style="s2">these confrontations are opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">sort of to</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.119" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">challenge like the current psychic</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:02.559" style="s2">landscape and these</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:04.000" style="s2">figures you know the devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.559" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">the potential of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.000" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">arises within us to show us our</p>

<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.599" style="s2">both shadow and light um so that we can</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">is that he</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:44.000" style="s2">believes that there is a phallic nature</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:46.960" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.000" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">is being lost and i definitely see that</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">with a lot of what you would call the</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">the soy boys</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.520" end="00:50:06.880" style="s2">um that is causing women to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">their more</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.880" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">masculine devouring nature and i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.800" end="00:50:13.920" style="s2">that this is a positive thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:17.119" style="s2">um like i know is there a single woman</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.920" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">um here who&#39;s once married um i&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.119" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">my mistakes right um</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:22.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s very hard for me to meet men</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:25.839" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.559" end="00:50:28.400" style="s2">um exhibit any masculinity at all um and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.839" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">that has made me more in touch</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.400" end="00:50:35.200" style="s2">with the dark feminine aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">myself um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.200" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">i i definitely think we we are going</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:42.800" style="s2">through a feminization</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:45.440" style="s2">um in in this current zeitgeist and i i</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.800" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">believe that this has created a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.440" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">a bunch of like hashtag instagram</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:51.920" style="s2">pseudo feminists who are only willing to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:55.200" style="s2">discuss</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.920" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">the bright light and i do think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.200" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">it&#39;s very harmful</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:02.640" style="s2">to the cycle of birth like uh listen you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.640" end="00:51:06.319" style="s2">yeah definitely yeah i think this</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">question angen</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.319" end="00:51:10.000" style="s2">is like uh i&#39;ll just read it out loud</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">just so everybody can</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.000" end="00:51:13.280" style="s2">get it for the video um what do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:14.800" style="s2">think of alexander bard&#39;s model of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.280" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">world being more feminine or more</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.800" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">phallic</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">uh his whole digital libido thing um so</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">you know i think i i i understand bard&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">position which is basically there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">phallus there&#39;s no phallus around</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">there&#39;s no authentic valleys basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">um what we&#39;re seeing is a kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">excess of femininity uh and you can even</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:35.040" style="s2">see this in</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">um the kind of more excessive stages</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.040" end="00:51:40.880" style="s2">of feminism where</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:42.000" style="s2">you know little boys are being</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.880" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">encouraged to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.000" end="00:51:45.040" style="s2">you know take on feminine traits or to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:47.520" style="s2">dress up as</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.040" end="00:51:48.640" style="s2">as girls you know like an actual kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.520" end="00:51:50.880" style="s2">um desire</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.640" end="00:51:52.400" style="s2">and this i would say is the devouring</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.880" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">mother this is the devouring mother</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.400" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">showing up</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:58.880" style="s2">in real life with with their children</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:00.319" style="s2">um where she&#39;s like you know wants to</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.880" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">create the child and her</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.319" end="00:52:05.520" style="s2">image of what is best for the child</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:07.520" style="s2">and in a way is imposing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.520" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">feminization on the child because there</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.520" end="00:52:12.480" style="s2">has been a demonization of masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:13.200" style="s2">and for bard right like the authentic</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.480" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">phallus</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.200" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">is um something that is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">to attain</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">um it is a masculine pursuit and has</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:22.160" style="s2">been traditionally</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">and um is something that&#39;s necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.160" end="00:52:25.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">perpetuation of civilization and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.280" end="00:52:27.680" style="s2">know this is where his understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.680" end="00:52:33.839" style="s2">fits in um so religion is like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">template or a process or you know a set</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.839" end="00:52:39.280" style="s2">of kind of metaphysical precepts</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.000" end="00:52:40.240" style="s2">that allows for a person to move</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.280" end="00:52:42.640" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.240" end="00:52:43.920" style="s2">into a process of becoming the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.640" end="00:52:47.359" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.920" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">um phallic force of existence and um you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.359" end="00:52:51.040" style="s2">know the messiah</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:51.760" style="s2">would be an example of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.040" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">authentic</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.760" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">phallic figure and right now we have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:52:58.160" style="s2">lack of leaders</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:52:58.640" style="s2">in our in our world um there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.160" end="00:53:01.119" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.640" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">bard would say is like kind of peter pan</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.119" end="00:53:04.880" style="s2">little boys running the show</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:06.960" style="s2">who are more interested in their own</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.880" end="00:53:07.599" style="s2">narcissism and their own need for</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.960" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.599" end="00:53:12.240" style="s2">than they are in actually doing the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:15.760" style="s2">difficult work of making hard decisions</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.240" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">and leading the world um and so well i</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.760" end="00:53:17.680" style="s2">mean my question about this has been</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.680" end="00:53:21.680" style="s2">what is the kind of virtual phallus</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:24.319" style="s2">right um so of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.680" end="00:53:25.280" style="s2">men have penises that&#39;s like a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:27.839" style="s2">direct</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.280" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">um relationship to the phallus uh but</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.839" end="00:53:31.760" style="s2">the phallus as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.520" style="s2">authentic phallus is not that which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">just inherently endowed</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.520" end="00:53:37.920" style="s2">to a man it is not you have to work for</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.440" style="s2">it you have to become</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.920" end="00:53:41.040" style="s2">that thing and in that sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.440" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">virtual and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.040" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">i wonder about can i do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:49.839" style="s2">do i need a penis to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">the virtual authentic phallus i actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.839" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">think that there&#39;s a possibility that i</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">that i don&#39;t um i think that&#39;s a unique</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:59.920" style="s2">kind of quality of becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">um integration of these two forces and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.920" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">think camille poglia i mean she</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">identifies</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">she identifies as trans and i actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:06.800" style="s2">think that this is exactly what she</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:08.880" style="s2">thinks of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.800" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">is is this kind of virtuality of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.880" end="00:54:12.079" style="s2">authentic phallus</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">i&#39;m in her embodiment of this through</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">in a kind of synthesis and a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.400" end="00:54:40.559" style="s2">dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">um so yeah i mean this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.559" end="00:54:43.599" style="s2">questions that i&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">quite a lot in my own thinking is like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.599" end="00:54:47.839" style="s2">the bardian kind of um view of reality</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:48.319" style="s2">and how that fits in with the polyand</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.839" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">view</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.319" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">and then where that kind of places men</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:53.760" style="s2">and women in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:55.520" style="s2">actualizing themselves and i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.760" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">hoping that we can have alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.520" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">on to talk</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">through some of the elements that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">specifically around</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">um the feminine because you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:04.720" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:06.319" style="s2">lots of things that he talks about but i</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.720" end="00:55:07.280" style="s2">really want to nail him down on on this</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.319" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">specific element</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.280" end="00:55:10.400" style="s2">so thanks for the question raven if i</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:13.440" style="s2">could ask</p>

<p begin="00:55:13.440" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t quite understand like how</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">society or the internet like such</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.960" end="00:55:23.839" style="s2">large meta things can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">phallic or female in nature like could</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.839" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">you help us there</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">sure um so in order to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:31.359" style="s2">that i think i&#39;m going to reference</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.359" end="00:55:35.520" style="s2">um so marshall mcluhan for those of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">who don&#39;t know was a media theorist that</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.520" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:39.359" style="s2">extraordinarily influential um in you</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">know the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.359" end="00:55:46.079" style="s2">50s and 60s and um he basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:47.839" style="s2">outlines this uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.079" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">understanding of mediums right so his</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.839" end="00:55:50.240" style="s2">classic statement is the medium is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">message</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.240" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">um so there&#39;s certain kinds of mediums</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">that have</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:56:00.839" style="s2">a kind of grammar to them right so he</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:02.799" style="s2">differentiates two there is the acoustic</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.839" end="00:56:06.880" style="s2">medium the acoustic medium</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.799" end="00:56:10.040" style="s2">is um perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.880" end="00:56:13.040" style="s2">it&#39;s uh that which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.040" end="00:56:15.119" style="s2">non-linear it kind of moves around you</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.040" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s receptive it comes</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.119" end="00:56:19.760" style="s2">to you and i think that this maps on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:22.640" style="s2">acoustic medium maps on</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.760" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">very well to the dionysian or the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.640" end="00:56:27.200" style="s2">feminine</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:31.200" style="s2">the medium the visual medium</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.200" end="00:56:33.119" style="s2">which is uh literacy it&#39;s writing so</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.200" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">acoustic orality that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.119" end="00:56:38.880" style="s2">communication medium</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">um and the literacy which is a visual</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.880" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">medium because you</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">you read the communication is sequential</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:49.839" style="s2">it&#39;s delineated um it is</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">in this sense the apollonian which is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.839" end="00:56:54.160" style="s2">also associated with</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:55.760" style="s2">the phallus right um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.160" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">grounding those ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.760" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">in kind of properties that you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">actually interact with</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">um so reading a long book like one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.799" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">bad boys is is a like phallic endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">it is like an endeavor of the sequential</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:12.160" style="s2">it is an endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">of moving um through a grammar that</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.160" end="00:57:16.000" style="s2">pushes you forward through a linear</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">progression of time</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.000" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">to listen you know to to be around a</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:26.000" style="s2">campfire to be in an oral tradition</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">um is not sequential in the same respect</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.000" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">and what mcluhan theorizes is that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.960" style="s2">internet</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.559" end="00:57:34.160" style="s2">is actually going to be a revival of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.960" end="00:57:37.200" style="s2">acoustic</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.160" end="00:57:40.240" style="s2">um that the qualities</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">of the acoustic medium will be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.240" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:46.160" style="s2">the digital medium and i think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">seen this bore out so we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.160" end="00:57:50.160" style="s2">moving away</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:52.079" style="s2">from communicating through long form</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.160" end="00:57:53.359" style="s2">arguments this is something that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.079" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">know the enlightenment people are</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.359" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">freaking out about because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">seeing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">what they consider to be a regression um</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:03.839" style="s2">but really what it is is a kind of uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.520" style="s2">exploration of the medium of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.839" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">internet which is that which is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.520" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">through image</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:10.480" style="s2">you can create images and you can uh</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:11.920" style="s2">snapshot them so that they have their</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.480" end="00:58:14.480" style="s2">own kind of grammar</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.920" end="00:58:15.359" style="s2">and that is a new communication style</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.480" end="00:58:18.400" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.359" end="00:58:20.079" style="s2">dionysian elements um it&#39;s empathic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.400" end="00:58:22.400" style="s2">intentional</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.079" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">it isn&#39;t doesn&#39;t have to explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.400" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">reveal what it</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">means you look at a video and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">looks self-evident um what it means um</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">and yet it actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:35.200" style="s2">is hiding i mean you can think about</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">instagram right</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.200" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">you you cultivate a kind of perception</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">but behind the camera you know your</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:44.160" style="s2">house is in disarray right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:45.760" style="s2">this like this distance between</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.160" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">um that which is presented and that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.760" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">which is experienced</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:55.040" style="s2">um and this medium</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:57.119" style="s2">the digital medium has very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.040" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">feminine qualities in this sense so</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.119" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">um it i don&#39;t know if that helps at all</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">but i think um kind of grounding it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:06.640" style="s2">some specificity</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:08.000" style="s2">of medium is a really uh a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.640" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">accessing this and i would</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.000" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">absolutely recommend marshall mcluhan um</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:16.079" style="s2">as a way to get a handle</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">on what it means to even say like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.079" end="00:59:19.599" style="s2">internet is feminizing like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:21.200" style="s2">i mean that i mean if you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.599" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">context that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.200" end="00:59:25.359" style="s2">patently absurd you&#39;re like what do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:26.799" style="s2">mean by that um but when you kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.359" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">it as connected to these other</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.799" end="00:59:30.079" style="s2">theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">um concepts it actually does open up the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.079" end="00:59:34.880" style="s2">possibility of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">how these elements are are connected to</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.880" end="00:59:38.960" style="s2">one another</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">is there a mcluhan book in particular</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.960" end="00:59:41.599" style="s2">you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">i will get back to you i&#39;m thinking of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.559" end="00:59:50.160" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">understanding media is his thick one</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.720" end="01:00:02.880" style="s2">symbolic nature of dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.240" end="01:00:04.799" style="s2">of just like generating messages on how</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.880" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">the media operates</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.799" end="01:00:08.960" style="s2">on in an objective kind of systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:11.760" style="s2">thinking approach</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.960" end="01:00:13.040" style="s2">um so understanding media if you want to</p>
