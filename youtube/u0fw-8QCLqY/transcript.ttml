<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:05.370" style="s2">tonight I&#39;m here to talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.879" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">none of the above you know how it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.370" end="00:00:09.840" style="s2">around election time and you decide not</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:17.820" style="s2">to vote because the two candidates are</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.840" end="00:00:20.130" style="s2">so repulsive I never wear a suit I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.820" end="00:00:22.320" style="s2">these are just things that politicians</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.130" end="00:00:26.180" style="s2">use to trick you into thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.320" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">they&#39;re respectable well the politician</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.180" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">that was a clip from a movie Brewster&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:34.320" style="s2">Millions and I&#39;m using it just as a fun</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:36.840" style="s2">way to introduce an idea that idea being</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.320" end="00:00:40.530" style="s2">none of the above and by that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.840" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">specifically what I mean is that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.530" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">campaign be started to encourage people</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:45.690" style="s2">next time they go to the polls to</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:47.610" style="s2">instead of voting for any of the options</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.690" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">that are on there to draw an additional</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.610" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">option none of the above put a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">box next to it tick the little box and</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">stick that in the ballot box and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:57.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not merely as a protest but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:00:58.890" style="s2">very much more to it than that and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.750" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">gonna make the short series of videos</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.890" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">probably four of them in total to unpack</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:06.330" style="s2">this in full so this is the introductory</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:08.070" style="s2">one and for this one I really just want</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">to put the idea out there and very</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:12.090" style="s2">briefly touch on some of the things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:15.150" style="s2">going to explore in more detail in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.090" end="00:01:17.970" style="s2">future videos and so the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.150" end="00:01:20.630" style="s2">point of none of the above is to create</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.970" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">a space in which an inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.630" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">wide-ranging free discussion can occur</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">in which new methodologies new</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:33.810" style="s2">philosophies new principles for</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">organizing ourselves can be looked at</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.810" end="00:01:37.590" style="s2">and can be tried out on small scales and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:38.280" style="s2">experiments can be grabbed and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.590" end="00:01:41.210" style="s2">so on and so on</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.280" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">because within the current framework of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:45.750" style="s2">unbelievably limited political debate if</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:49.350" style="s2">you can even call it there there is no</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.750" end="00:01:52.020" style="s2">possibility of meaningful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.350" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">constructive solutions to the problems</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.020" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">that faces emerging so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">overarching point and then within that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">there are I guess three sub themes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:04.590" style="s2">first of those is fraction astuteness</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">and disunity I mean we see it everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.590" end="00:02:09.060" style="s2">we look I&#39;m personally part of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">resource-based economics movement you</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.060" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">know part of the activist community and</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:14.130" style="s2">you know even within there people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.650" style="s2">were all on the same team</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.130" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">find little things to argue about</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.650" end="00:02:20.459" style="s2">primarily I think out of a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:23.100" style="s2">frustration but the point is that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.459" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">simplicity of none of the above we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.100" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t conflict with anything that</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">anyone else is doing you know other</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:30.739" style="s2">activists other changemakers whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:33.870" style="s2">is they are personally interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.739" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">seeking to change none of the above can</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.870" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">run alongside that the second part of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.180" end="00:02:41.730" style="s2">would be a recognition that our systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.709" style="s2">are incapable of coming up to coming up</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.730" end="00:02:45.510" style="s2">with solutions to problems which they</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.709" end="00:02:48.600" style="s2">themselves have caused and again I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.510" end="00:02:50.280" style="s2">into this more but again it comes back</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.600" end="00:02:52.440" style="s2">to clearing a space if the current</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.280" end="00:02:55.830" style="s2">structures institutions thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.440" end="00:02:57.720" style="s2">processes are incapable of solving the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.830" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">problems then we need to clear them out</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.720" end="00:03:00.780" style="s2">of the way in order to make room for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">kinds of thought processes and</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.780" end="00:03:05.940" style="s2">procedures and so on that have some</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:08.450" style="s2">chance of solving the problems and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.940" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">third part of it is about reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.450" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">sovereignty reclaiming our power as the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">electorate as the people as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.370" end="00:03:20.730" style="s2">as well and so what a widespread none of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">the above campaign could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.730" end="00:03:26.130" style="s2">achieve if you know if 51% of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:29.880" style="s2">vote none of the above this effectively</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.130" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">withdraws the consent of the people for</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.880" end="00:03:34.890" style="s2">the government to govern them right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">it&#39;s once again an acknowledgment that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.890" end="00:03:38.850" style="s2">we need a space to come up with things</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:40.320" style="s2">which are different to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.850" end="00:03:42.140" style="s2">things which are better to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.320" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">things that nobody has yet thought of</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.140" end="00:03:46.500" style="s2">but have no chance of thinking over at</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:47.700" style="s2">least the ideas have no chance of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.500" end="00:03:50.190" style="s2">gaining any traction</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.700" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">within the current framework so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.190" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a recognition of all of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:57.000" style="s2">things at once so I guess that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:59.430" style="s2">all I have to say for now I&#39;m just going</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.000" end="00:04:02.130" style="s2">to leave you with a clip from a speech</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.430" end="00:04:04.950" style="s2">that JFK gave some fifty five years ago</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.130" end="00:04:08.840" style="s2">which i think is apropos and thank you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.950" end="00:04:12.230" style="s2">for listening our problems are man-made</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.840" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">therefore they can be solved by man and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.230" end="00:04:20.269" style="s2">man can be as big as he wants no problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">of human destiny is beyond human beings</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.269" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">man&#39;s reason and spirit have often</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:29.699" style="s2">solved the seemingly unsolvable</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:32.280" style="s2">and we believe they can do it again for</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.699" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">in the final analysis our most basic</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.280" end="00:04:39.770" style="s2">common link is that we all inhabit this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:42.330" style="s2">small planet we all breathe the same air</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.770" end="00:04:46.199" style="s2">we all cherish our children&#39;s futures</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.330" end="00:04:48.090" style="s2">and we are all mortal</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.199" end="00:04:49.889" style="s2">the only thing that silly is the power</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:51.680" style="s2">of the people&#39;s vote and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.889" end="00:05:01.579" style="s2">people should use it to vote for</p>
