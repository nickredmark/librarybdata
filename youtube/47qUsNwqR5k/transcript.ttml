<p begin="00:17:56.550" end="00:18:01.310" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises to</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.779" end="00:19:24.059" style="s2">okay so we have some time for some</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.100" end="00:19:26.279" style="s2">questions a question for Manuel post</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.059" end="00:19:28.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve been having issues labeling fonts</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.279" end="00:19:30.299" style="s2">and Counting the act of making myself</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.049" end="00:19:36.090" style="s2">conscious verbally of the action is</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.299" end="00:19:37.559" style="s2">taking too much my focus so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.090" end="00:19:41.130" style="s2">quite sure what you mean by too much of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.559" end="00:19:44.630" style="s2">your focus do you mean that the act of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.130" end="00:19:49.769" style="s2">speaking is sort of taking out of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.630" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">meditative focus that you&#39;re in perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.769" end="00:20:01.860" style="s2">that&#39;s what you mean if you can step</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:20:04.710" style="s2">back and note your distractions as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.860" end="00:20:09.659" style="s2">process if you can step back and note</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.710" end="00:20:11.519" style="s2">them from the from the standpoint of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.659" end="00:20:13.350" style="s2">five factors of inquiring mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.519" end="00:20:14.909" style="s2">and if you can do all of that without in</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.350" end="00:20:18.539" style="s2">their speech and let go of the inner</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.909" end="00:20:20.730" style="s2">speech the inner speech is a coach that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.539" end="00:20:21.440" style="s2">eventually you let go of you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.730" end="00:20:28.830" style="s2">it anymore</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.440" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">so if you can do all of what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.830" end="00:20:34.200" style="s2">training without having to do the actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:37.139" style="s2">inner verbalization because you find</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.200" end="00:20:40.350" style="s2">that perhaps jarring you out of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.139" end="00:20:45.149" style="s2">mindfulness state then don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.350" end="00:20:48.779" style="s2">but if what&#39;s happening is right your</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.149" end="00:20:52.409" style="s2">your what you&#39;re saying is well when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.779" end="00:20:54.289" style="s2">label it sort of brings me sort of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.409" end="00:20:58.049" style="s2">a demand on me</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.289" end="00:20:59.850" style="s2">so the hesitancy there I have if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.049" end="00:21:01.500" style="s2">if there&#39;s another thing you might be</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.850" end="00:21:04.889" style="s2">talking about which is you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.500" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">getting into a lulled State that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.889" end="00:21:10.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know if this is the case you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.299" style="s2">getting into a very low state and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.110" end="00:21:16.470" style="s2">act of sort of labeling and destruction</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.299" end="00:21:19.409" style="s2">wakes you up a bit alerts that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.470" end="00:21:21.360" style="s2">something that you should try and step</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.409" end="00:21:23.909" style="s2">away from and you should then embrace</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.360" end="00:21:25.529" style="s2">the act of the labeling because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.909" end="00:21:28.830" style="s2">actually bringing the alertness to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.529" end="00:21:30.000" style="s2">mind so I suspect it&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.830" end="00:21:32.100" style="s2">first that I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.000" end="00:21:34.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re you&#39;re getting to a place</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.100" end="00:21:37.380" style="s2">where verbalization is actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.680" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">disruptive of the mindfulness that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.380" end="00:21:41.430" style="s2">can bring to bear enquiring mind fulness</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:43.650" style="s2">you can bring to bear on your</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.430" end="00:21:45.510" style="s2">distractions and if that&#39;s the case let</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.650" end="00:21:49.380" style="s2">the verbalization go it is just a raft</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.510" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">it is just a coach but as I said if</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.380" end="00:21:53.340" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is you&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:56.160" style="s2">a very low dulled state and it&#39;s feeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.340" end="00:21:57.930" style="s2">sort of warm and fuzzy and cozy and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.160" end="00:21:59.610" style="s2">don&#39;t like to do the verbal distraction</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.930" end="00:22:01.860" style="s2">the verbal labeling of your distractions</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.610" end="00:22:04.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of waking you up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.860" end="00:22:06.690" style="s2">jarring you then you should be doing the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.500" end="00:22:11.820" style="s2">labeling so whichever one of those it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.690" end="00:22:14.970" style="s2">most appropriate in the one give up the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.820" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">verbalization and the other you may need</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.970" end="00:22:21.540" style="s2">to embrace it more as I said I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:26.670" style="s2">for you it&#39;s probably the former mark</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.540" end="00:22:28.200" style="s2">without high mark what do I do if I can</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.670" end="00:22:29.370" style="s2">hear and feel my heart beating other</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.200" end="00:22:31.440" style="s2">special ways to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.370" end="00:22:34.830" style="s2">conditions not particularly quickly just</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.440" end="00:22:36.420" style="s2">hyper aware okay so this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.830" end="00:22:37.320" style="s2">happen to many people along this journey</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.420" end="00:22:39.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.320" end="00:22:44.040" style="s2">it&#39;s also different parts of your body</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.080" end="00:22:46.410" style="s2">at different stages so as we practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.040" end="00:22:49.110" style="s2">insula especially sorry as we practice</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.410" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">there are introspective behaviors like</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.110" end="00:22:52.860" style="s2">becoming more aware of our body we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:56.070" style="s2">activating the insula this is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.860" end="00:22:57.900" style="s2">our brain part and that the insula is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.070" end="00:22:59.340" style="s2">always not also active when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.900" end="00:23:02.790" style="s2">picking up on other people&#39;s mental</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.340" end="00:23:04.770" style="s2">states so it&#39;s very powerfully engaged</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.790" end="00:23:06.540" style="s2">in mindfulness dan Siegel argues and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.770" end="00:23:07.830" style="s2">think he&#39;s correct that what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.540" end="00:23:09.930" style="s2">with mindfulness is we&#39;re taking the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.830" end="00:23:11.850" style="s2">ability we use picking up on other</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.930" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">people&#39;s mental states and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.850" end="00:23:16.110" style="s2">internalizing it we&#39;re turning out</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:18.150" style="s2">turning it on ourselves so what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.110" end="00:23:19.680" style="s2">happen as we do this practice is we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.870" end="00:23:27.990" style="s2">practicing your your insula is going to</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.730" end="00:27:58.820" style="s2">there are forgiving practices you can go</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.700" end="00:28:01.350" style="s2">into the Christian meditation tradition</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.820" end="00:28:03.419" style="s2">especially the centering prayers and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.350" end="00:28:04.590" style="s2">prayer of the heart and then they have a</p>

<p begin="00:28:04.590" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">supplementary forgiving practices and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.179" end="00:28:11.470" style="s2">you may be able to integrate that with</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:17.169" style="s2">what I&#39;m teaching you I hope that was</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.470" end="00:28:19.210" style="s2">hopeful the your taro Nakamura I found</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.169" end="00:28:21.730" style="s2">meditation called body scan what do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.210" end="00:28:27.519" style="s2">think about it the body scan is derived</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.730" end="00:28:29.759" style="s2">from Jon kabat-zinn z-- MBSR a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.519" end="00:28:33.159" style="s2">mindfulness based stress reduction and</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.759" end="00:28:35.769" style="s2">when I&#39;m teaching you to find your flow</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.159" end="00:28:36.609" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the same thing during</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.769" end="00:28:39.279" style="s2">the body&#39;s yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.609" end="00:28:43.450" style="s2">I tend to emphasize the cultivation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.279" end="00:28:46.299" style="s2">flow and not just the scanning awareness</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.450" end="00:28:49.570" style="s2">and so it integrates aspect of the body</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.299" end="00:28:51.309" style="s2">scan with the task of all actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.570" end="00:28:54.359" style="s2">helping to cultivate the flow state and</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.309" end="00:28:59.889" style="s2">thereby enhance absorption so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.359" end="00:29:02.619" style="s2">the two are deeply integrated in in what</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.889" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">I&#39;m teaching you this is really good</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.619" end="00:29:09.369" style="s2">questions you know I mean you teach the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:11.259" style="s2">best when you&#39;re learning right and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.369" end="00:29:13.960" style="s2">want to think of it with these questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.259" end="00:29:16.450" style="s2">they make me reflect they help me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.960" end="00:29:20.980" style="s2">explicate they deduce they draw out from</p>
