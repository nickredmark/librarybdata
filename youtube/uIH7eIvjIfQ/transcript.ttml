<p begin="00:00:27.050" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">there is a certain amount of bad</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:34.920" style="s2">behavior in the chat and comments and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:38.100" style="s2">know that this is standard for YouTube I</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.920" end="00:00:40.110" style="s2">also know that for Heather and me this</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.100" end="00:00:42.680" style="s2">has been a lot less terrible than it is</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.110" end="00:00:46.559" style="s2">on most other channels so thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.680" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">being disciplined and I know that as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.559" end="00:00:50.399" style="s2">channel grows this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:51.780" style="s2">problem as new people show up and they</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.399" end="00:00:54.780" style="s2">don&#39;t realize that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.780" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">community spirit around here and in any</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.780" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">case to the extent that you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">out ways to disincentivize that behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">please do and to the extent that there</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:05.129" style="s2">are numskulls who want to come into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">chat and do anything they can to start a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">race war or whatever else you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">to do please don&#39;t this is very serious</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:13.740" style="s2">no matter what side of the political</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.439" style="s2">spectrum you may be on we are in a very</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.740" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">difficult moment in history a moment</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.439" end="00:01:22.049" style="s2">when there&#39;s so much gasoline and tinder</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:25.049" style="s2">around that one numbskull might be able</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.049" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">to set the whole thing a flame and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.049" end="00:01:28.280" style="s2">would be a terrible shame if we&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">on this channel so please don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.280" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">alright get to the Q&#39;s and A&#39;s all right</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna start as always many many</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:39.299" style="s2">good questions I&#39;ve only looked at a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">of them but we&#39;re gonna start with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.299" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">question that has been asked twice</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.840" style="s2">previously which we didn&#39;t get to twice</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">so here we go are you at all concerned</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.840" end="00:01:49.710" style="s2">that growing global tensions between the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:51.570" style="s2">USA and China are leading us to an</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.710" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">inevitable Cold War and quite possibly</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.570" end="00:01:56.759" style="s2">an actual hot war in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">where the legacy superpower USA faces</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.759" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">off against the latest up-and-comer</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:06.299" style="s2">China yes in fact I&#39;m not even sure that</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">the political discord that we find</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">ourselves running into is not being</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:13.560" style="s2">seeded or amplified by some of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:15.180" style="s2">enemies who have recognized</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.560" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">that we have set ourselves up for</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.180" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">failure and that if they stir the pot at</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:21.030" style="s2">this moment we may well do ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">and save them the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.030" end="00:02:25.530" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s the new crypto warfare it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:28.830" style="s2">the new crypto warfare and we would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.530" end="00:02:32.269" style="s2">very wise that the hardest thing is you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.830" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">don&#39;t see this system broken as it is is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.269" end="00:02:36.599" style="s2">doing a tremendous amount of work that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:38.610" style="s2">you don&#39;t notice the part that functions</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.599" end="00:02:41.910" style="s2">is not visible and you&#39;ll note you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.610" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">detect it when it&#39;s gone so we all have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.910" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">an interest in preserving this structure</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:47.100" style="s2">the idea that this is the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:49.890" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go after George Washington</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.100" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">of all people is so absurd and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.890" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">dangerous we have to recognize what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">is that unites us and what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:02:57.959" style="s2">separates us and let&#39;s do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:00.599" style="s2">about that latter part but tearing apart</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.959" end="00:03:03.900" style="s2">the former part is an act of purest</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.599" end="00:03:06.569" style="s2">insanity and can I just remind those who</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.900" end="00:03:09.299" style="s2">may not remember that you say this as</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.569" end="00:03:11.670" style="s2">someone who and this is true for me too</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.299" end="00:03:13.590" style="s2">who sees neither of the major party</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.670" end="00:03:15.599" style="s2">candidates as viable solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.590" end="00:03:17.549" style="s2">problems that we have in part because</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.599" end="00:03:20.040" style="s2">put aside Trump for the moment but why</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.549" end="00:03:22.170" style="s2">isn&#39;t Biden a viable solution he&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.040" end="00:03:24.150" style="s2">know he&#39;s basically giving us the bush</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.170" end="00:03:26.160" style="s2">line you know put aside his likely</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.150" end="00:03:29.459" style="s2">mental incompetence but he&#39;s giving us</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.160" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">the sort of bush to line bush one-line</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.459" end="00:03:34.790" style="s2">to stay the course we&#39;re on right stay</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:37.859" style="s2">the course and you have been arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.790" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">decades that the many parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.859" end="00:03:43.230" style="s2">course are broken so you it is not that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">you think that everything is fine this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.230" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">is not a you know a volte area a Candide</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:51.630" style="s2">like universe in which everything is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.100" end="00:03:53.609" style="s2">going along just fine but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.630" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">fundamentals of the system which are</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.609" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">working are invisible to those who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">complaining that the entire thing must</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.440" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">be burned down and it is very like</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.690" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">quitting smoking</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:06.780" style="s2">the fact is yeah this is a terrible time</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:08.069" style="s2">to have to figure out what to do but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.780" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2">keeps getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.069" end="00:04:12.600" style="s2">so as bad as it is now to have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:15.450" style="s2">out how to rescue ourselves from two non</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.600" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">viable candidates you don&#39;t want it to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.450" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">be worse and it is not the fault of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">people who have been telling you this</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.380" style="s2">election after election it&#39;s not our</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">fault the fact that you&#39;re finally</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.380" end="00:04:27.100" style="s2">listening that is not on us yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">guess one just one more thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.100" end="00:04:30.730" style="s2">thinking about the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:33.070" style="s2">cold war in hot war which made a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.730" end="00:04:36.700" style="s2">sense I think it&#39;s a distinction to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.070" end="00:04:39.670" style="s2">up through the late 80s or so when the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.700" end="00:04:41.440" style="s2">Cold War nominally ended but the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.670" end="00:04:43.210" style="s2">crypto war that can go on a war of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.440" end="00:04:45.790" style="s2">information that is now possible at all</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.210" end="00:04:47.920" style="s2">moments in all places actually doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.790" end="00:04:49.270" style="s2">care if the war is also otherwise cold</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.920" end="00:04:52.630" style="s2">or hot so that will continue regardless</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.270" end="00:04:54.250" style="s2">and that means that the boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.630" end="00:04:57.250" style="s2">between these things are even harder to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.250" end="00:05:00.730" style="s2">determine yeah actually good point let</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.250" end="00:05:03.220" style="s2">me add one thing to it hmm this is a new</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.730" end="00:05:06.100" style="s2">thought I reserve the right to go back</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.220" end="00:05:08.290" style="s2">and fix it yeah you&#39;ve got cold Wars and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.100" end="00:05:12.480" style="s2">hot Wars you&#39;ve got something we call</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.290" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">terrorism terrorism is yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.480" end="00:05:18.550" style="s2">hijacking of your fight-or-flight reflex</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:20.860" style="s2">to get you to harm yourself an enemy</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.550" end="00:05:23.200" style="s2">that can&#39;t harm you uses terror to get</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.860" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">you to harm yourself same way that it</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.200" end="00:05:27.880" style="s2">might get your immune system to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:32.230" style="s2">compromise you if it can&#39;t outright hurt</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.880" end="00:05:33.520" style="s2">you this cyber meddling the cyber</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.230" end="00:05:36.640" style="s2">meddling in our ability to think</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.520" end="00:05:38.620" style="s2">straight is not terror it&#39;s not that you</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.640" end="00:05:42.040" style="s2">go on Twitter and are terrified into</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.620" end="00:05:44.890" style="s2">hurting yourself but it&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.040" end="00:05:47.050" style="s2">they drugged us whoever it is that feeds</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.890" end="00:05:49.630" style="s2">bad information into that system is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.050" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">basically bewildering us so that we will</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.630" end="00:05:53.950" style="s2">fall off a cliff or fall down the stairs</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:56.040" style="s2">or something like that and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.950" end="00:05:58.750" style="s2">the first thing to do is recognize</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.040" end="00:06:01.150" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t want us to see clearly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.750" end="00:06:03.430" style="s2">there&#39;s organic noise and then there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.150" end="00:06:08.440" style="s2">amplified noise your enemy might only</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.430" end="00:06:09.580" style="s2">have to get you confused enough to to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.440" end="00:06:11.320" style="s2">get yourself into a civil war for</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.580" end="00:06:13.240" style="s2">example that you can&#39;t afford and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.320" end="00:06:15.010" style="s2">would do their bidding they won&#39;t fight</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.240" end="00:06:17.980" style="s2">you they&#39;ll have you fight you hmm</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.010" end="00:06:20.560" style="s2">so ya know there&#39;s a lot more here with</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.980" end="00:06:23.200" style="s2">regard to what what emotions are being</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.560" end="00:06:26.470" style="s2">played it&#39;s not terror as you say but is</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.200" end="00:06:29.800" style="s2">it you know creating such slothfulness</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.470" end="00:06:30.880" style="s2">and complacency that you don&#39;t bother to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.800" end="00:06:33.970" style="s2">get up and at the point that you do</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.880" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">you&#39;re so outraged at what you have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.970" end="00:06:36.970" style="s2">led to believe that you then spill into</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.870" style="s2">the streets and destroy statues of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.970" end="00:06:41.500" style="s2">George Washington you know is is there</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.870" end="00:06:44.540" style="s2">is there no middle ground left possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.500" end="00:06:48.500" style="s2">when it&#39;s this kind of information war</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.540" end="00:06:49.520" style="s2">yep yeah okay next question different</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.500" end="00:06:50.900" style="s2">neighborhoods and cultures have</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.520" end="00:06:52.820" style="s2">different levels of noise at night</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.900" end="00:06:55.520" style="s2">for instance loud music mufflers that</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.820" end="00:06:58.460" style="s2">roar like lions buy homes poor sleep</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.520" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">lowers IQ and impulse control can sleep</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.460" end="00:07:02.360" style="s2">disturbances from loud noises affect</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.020" end="00:07:04.790" style="s2">academic and economic gaps are there</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.360" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">solutions it&#39;s a really good question</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.790" end="00:07:08.030" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question that includes so</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.310" style="s2">much of the information you need in an</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.030" end="00:07:14.020" style="s2">exam almost answers itself but yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.310" end="00:07:17.030" style="s2">thing is um go to the rich neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.020" end="00:07:19.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll see what&#39;s good we know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.030" end="00:07:23.229" style="s2">a secret yeah right we can talk all we</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.250" end="00:07:25.190" style="s2">want about you know GMOs are just a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.229" end="00:07:27.530" style="s2">modification like humans have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.190" end="00:07:28.520" style="s2">for thousands of years this garbage they</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.530" end="00:07:29.780" style="s2">eat organic food in the rich</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.520" end="00:07:30.919" style="s2">neighborhood and you can&#39;t afford him</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.780" end="00:07:33.710" style="s2">the poor neighborhood you may not even</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.919" end="00:07:36.380" style="s2">be able to source it so yeah the good</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.710" end="00:07:39.620" style="s2">neighborhood is quieter it has better</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.380" end="00:07:42.229" style="s2">schools it has higher quality food it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.620" end="00:07:44.630" style="s2">has a smaller space yeah I wake up to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.229" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">birdsong not car horns and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.630" end="00:07:48.320" style="s2">that&#39;s less true in in dense urban</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:49.669" style="s2">centers and you know it is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.320" end="00:07:52.580" style="s2">one of the reasons that cities like New</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.669" end="00:07:55.660" style="s2">York were actually like we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.580" end="00:07:59.229" style="s2">melting pots and did actually experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.660" end="00:08:01.340" style="s2">you know I think I think reductions in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.229" end="00:08:04.910" style="s2">racism because people were really living</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.340" end="00:08:06.590" style="s2">side-by-side and not just across the you</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.910" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">know standard demographics were expected</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.590" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">to talk about today along race lines but</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:13.940" style="s2">about socio-economic lines but you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:15.800" style="s2">in most cities and certainly as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.940" end="00:08:18.320" style="s2">you get out of the city center they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.800" end="00:08:20.960" style="s2">very stratified they are and even in New</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.320" end="00:08:24.530" style="s2">York you know if you if you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.960" end="00:08:25.789" style="s2">wealthy you live by the park and so one</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.530" end="00:08:28.460" style="s2">side of your building looks out on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.789" end="00:08:29.930" style="s2">quieter nicer space so anyway yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.460" end="00:08:32.510" style="s2">not we can&#39;t compare between cities</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.930" end="00:08:34.520" style="s2">necessarily but we know what works we</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.510" end="00:08:36.860" style="s2">know what&#39;s harmful and we externalize</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.520" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">all of this harm onto people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.860" end="00:08:40.250" style="s2">politically powerful enough to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">it and so yes the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.250" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">question is there are solutions and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">involve confronting what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:49.640" style="s2">actually causes well-being and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:51.170" style="s2">opportunity to be hoarded in some parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.640" end="00:08:52.550" style="s2">of town and excluded from others and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.170" end="00:08:54.410" style="s2">there ain&#39;t no way of getting</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.550" end="00:08:56.870" style="s2">around its that it you know we either</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.410" end="00:08:59.660" style="s2">confronted or it&#39;s the French Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.870" end="00:09:01.940" style="s2">they&#39;re worse ya know and I guess again</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.660" end="00:09:04.250" style="s2">this this could warrant many many hours</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.940" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">of conversation but usually when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.250" end="00:09:07.880" style="s2">about pollution and you until 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:09.350" style="s2">ago whenever you heard talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.880" end="00:09:11.510" style="s2">pollution it was about particulate</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.350" end="00:09:13.430" style="s2">matter you know actual you know things</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.510" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">that could lodge in you and cause I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.430" end="00:09:18.320" style="s2">their physical or chemical or biological</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:20.029" style="s2">damage but noise pollution and light</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.320" end="00:09:22.940" style="s2">pollution are real these are not just</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.029" end="00:09:25.130" style="s2">made-up fictions by the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.940" end="00:09:27.800" style="s2">chattering academic glasses this is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.130" end="00:09:30.910" style="s2">is absolutely 100% real and having</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.800" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">access to true darkness at night and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.910" end="00:09:37.070" style="s2">true silence when you choose to have it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:39.290" style="s2">are luxuries that were not luxuries but</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.070" end="00:09:41.779" style="s2">expectations of human existence for most</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.290" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">of humanity&#39;s existence on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.779" end="00:09:46.399" style="s2">and the lack of ability to procure those</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:49.610" style="s2">things for a large proportion of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.399" end="00:09:51.709" style="s2">is staggeringly bad yeah I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.610" end="00:09:52.850" style="s2">there&#39;s also some kind of pollution that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.709" end="00:09:57.829" style="s2">I don&#39;t think has a name</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.850" end="00:09:59.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like reality pollution you know if</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.829" end="00:10:01.190" style="s2">you go to certain neighborhoods you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.570" end="00:10:04.040" style="s2">find you know the billboards are right</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.190" end="00:10:05.390" style="s2">adjacent to the dwelling and you go to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.040" end="00:10:06.649" style="s2">the wealthy neighborhood you know if</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.390" end="00:10:08.060" style="s2">somebody put up a billboard in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.649" end="00:10:09.860" style="s2">middle of your gated community there</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.060" end="00:10:11.510" style="s2">would be such an uprising that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.860" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t last the afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.510" end="00:10:16.910" style="s2">so anyway people know what to protect</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:18.260" style="s2">their own kids from to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.910" end="00:10:19.579" style="s2">the people who have the resources to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.260" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">protect their kids from everything bad</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.579" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">are you know telling us what it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.510" style="s2">that&#39;s harmful we shouldn&#39;t be allowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:31.160" style="s2">those things near anybody&#39;s kids yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.510" end="00:10:35.899" style="s2">that&#39;s right next question you voiced so</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.160" end="00:10:37.279" style="s2">this is written in telegraphic li4 to</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.899" end="00:10:39.040" style="s2">save characters but I will try to read</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.279" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">it as if it&#39;s written in full words I</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:42.920" style="s2">have you have voiced a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:45.350" style="s2">hopelessness about reaching the whoa</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.920" end="00:10:46.430" style="s2">Keys David fuller verbal wisdom says</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.350" end="00:10:47.810" style="s2">he&#39;s focusing on having this</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.430" end="00:10:50.209" style="s2">conversation without triggering the</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.810" end="00:10:51.760" style="s2">immune response I want to suggest that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.209" end="00:10:53.930" style="s2">we take cues from Benjamin Boyce</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:56.029" style="s2">especially in his recent episode with</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.930" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">the Union I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not familiar</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.029" end="00:10:59.209" style="s2">with that episode but obviously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.160" style="s2">familiar with Benjamin boys and with</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.209" end="00:11:04.720" style="s2">David fuller real wisdom and that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.160" end="00:11:06.819" style="s2">that&#39;s the question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.720" end="00:11:11.769" style="s2">let&#39;s put it this way the experience of</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.819" end="00:11:13.449" style="s2">trying to reach the truly woke is not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.769" end="00:11:15.160" style="s2">positive one because even to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.449" end="00:11:16.600" style="s2">that you can reach an individual it</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.160" end="00:11:18.339" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last it&#39;s not durable because</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.600" end="00:11:21.339" style="s2">they return to whatever milieu it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.339" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">that caused the the woke &#39;no sin the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.339" end="00:11:25.779" style="s2">first place there&#39;s undone although</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:28.389" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe a little seed planted Oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.779" end="00:11:29.740" style="s2">believe me I&#39;m a big fan of the planning</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.389" end="00:11:31.089" style="s2">the seed that can germinate later but</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.740" end="00:11:36.220" style="s2">there&#39;s also a campaign to eradicate</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.089" end="00:11:38.350" style="s2">those seeds socially the fact though is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.220" end="00:11:40.149" style="s2">maybe this is actually just the point</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.350" end="00:11:44.230" style="s2">you were just making we have started to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.149" end="00:11:46.689" style="s2">hear often it comes in the form of an</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.230" end="00:11:49.149" style="s2">apology which I must say I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.689" end="00:11:51.490" style="s2">need but people have started to contact</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.149" end="00:11:52.990" style="s2">us and say I got it wrong I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.490" end="00:11:55.750" style="s2">was just college campuses I thought you</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.990" end="00:11:58.180" style="s2">were exaggerating now I see right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.750" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">in the wake of the last three weeks yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.180" end="00:12:03.220" style="s2">and again I don&#39;t need an apology</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:04.600" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re you know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.220" end="00:12:05.889" style="s2">a big enough person to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.600" end="00:12:07.930" style="s2">you were wrong and actually say it to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.889" end="00:12:10.930" style="s2">somebody that you think you may have</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.930" end="00:12:12.639" style="s2">discounted that&#39;s that&#39;s a big thing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.930" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">that&#39;s all that&#39;s necessary from my</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.639" end="00:12:18.779" style="s2">perspective what what I would ask beyond</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:18.779" style="s2">that is okay now that you&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.030" end="00:12:24.700" style="s2">find your courage because you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.470" end="00:12:26.710" style="s2">need it right and with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.700" end="00:12:30.010" style="s2">woke it&#39;s not one level of woken us</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.710" end="00:12:33.160" style="s2">right there are people who are rescue</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.010" end="00:12:35.140" style="s2">able and the fact is to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.160" end="00:12:38.530" style="s2">we start bringing people over to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.140" end="00:12:40.510" style="s2">side of reason then we have greater</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.530" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">leverage to access people who are more</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.510" end="00:12:45.850" style="s2">deeply ensconced and so I do think most</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:47.800" style="s2">of the people involved in this movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.850" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">are not aware of what they have signed</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.800" end="00:12:50.860" style="s2">up with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:53.760" style="s2">no I think that&#39;s right and I found just</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.860" end="00:12:56.920" style="s2">just in the last couple of days I had</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.760" end="00:12:59.380" style="s2">interactions with some people who I know</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.920" end="00:13:01.810" style="s2">in a business relationship with you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.380" end="00:13:04.900" style="s2">like a structural integration therapist</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.810" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">and a haircut or haircut or hairdresser</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.900" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">and someone else I can&#39;t remember so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:10.630" style="s2">people who I have iterative</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.480" style="s2">relationships with I will see them again</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.630" end="00:13:15.810" style="s2">I enjoy them very much but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.480" end="00:13:20.230" style="s2">them well they don&#39;t know me well and</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.810" end="00:13:23.740" style="s2">it&#39;s easier especially for women on</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.230" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">average to just let the conversation go</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.740" end="00:13:30.120" style="s2">and when someone says something that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:32.610" style="s2">disagree with to to not disagree</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.120" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">especially right now right especially</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.610" end="00:13:38.530" style="s2">given that we are all being expected to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:43.150" style="s2">adopt the new the new gods and not doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.530" end="00:13:45.220" style="s2">so on my part with you know these people</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.150" end="00:13:47.110" style="s2">who had already chosen to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.220" end="00:13:49.030" style="s2">on the basis that they are reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.110" end="00:13:51.850" style="s2">and honorable and not completely</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.030" end="00:13:53.260" style="s2">ideological was still not the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.850" end="00:13:58.810" style="s2">thing in the world but absolutely a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.260" end="00:14:00.820" style="s2">hundred percent worth doing and I I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.810" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">would say that everyone can do at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.820" end="00:14:06.760" style="s2">that yeah everyone gonna do at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:09.730" style="s2">that that when you when you hear someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.760" end="00:14:13.540" style="s2">say something in what sounds like need</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.730" end="00:14:14.890" style="s2">your support of say a movement or an</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.540" end="00:14:19.090" style="s2">organization that you don&#39;t think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.890" end="00:14:21.970" style="s2">what it appears giving a little nudge in</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.090" end="00:14:24.520" style="s2">the direction of what you think can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.970" end="00:14:27.520" style="s2">can be the thing necessary to change</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.520" end="00:14:29.140" style="s2">people&#39;s minds and and just to open them</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.520" end="00:14:31.750" style="s2">up to the possibility that what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.140" end="00:14:32.590" style="s2">been told isn&#39;t the full truth and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.750" end="00:14:35.740" style="s2">not maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.590" end="00:14:38.170" style="s2">is not any of the truth in fact so what</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.740" end="00:14:43.840" style="s2">I&#39;ve said a number of times is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.170" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a a thing you can train</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.840" end="00:14:47.800" style="s2">yourself to do which is very rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.760" end="00:14:50.010" style="s2">which is when you have an unbridgeable</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.800" end="00:14:52.990" style="s2">gap figure out whether or not you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.010" end="00:14:54.670" style="s2">cross it in other words there are some</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.990" end="00:14:57.070" style="s2">gaps you probably can&#39;t cross but you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.670" end="00:14:59.050" style="s2">can practice the skill and the gaps you</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.070" end="00:15:00.520" style="s2">can cross get bigger and bigger and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:03.910" style="s2">very rewarding when you get across them</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.520" end="00:15:06.640" style="s2">so if we all took that approach we might</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.910" end="00:15:08.440" style="s2">do much better yeah ok</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.640" end="00:15:09.820" style="s2">this is this looks like a three-part</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.440" end="00:15:12.220" style="s2">question I&#39;ll read it all and then see</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.820" end="00:15:15.490" style="s2">where where we go back to hi you two</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.220" end="00:15:17.430" style="s2">first simply thanks is there a societal</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.490" end="00:15:19.450" style="s2">connectedness analog to Dunbar&#39;s number</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.430" end="00:15:21.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve gone from a small group of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.450" end="00:15:23.170" style="s2">primates to a global society but there</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.100" end="00:15:24.970" style="s2">are no guarantees beyond that where is</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.170" end="00:15:27.100" style="s2">our codes limit our carrying capacity</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.970" end="00:15:28.779" style="s2">recent events caused me to wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.100" end="00:15:30.190" style="s2">feedbacks exist within us that grow with</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.779" end="00:15:31.690" style="s2">societal complexity undermining</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.190" end="00:15:34.029" style="s2">pro-social behaviors for instance</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.690" end="00:15:36.670" style="s2">cooperation in borrowing a compensatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.029" end="00:15:39.160" style="s2">mechanism like swarming in bees we be on</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.670" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">the road to a collapse at best a second</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.160" end="00:15:42.910" style="s2">Dark Ages at worst a weapons of mass</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:44.920" style="s2">destruction fueled species level</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.910" end="00:15:46.510" style="s2">existential crisis our wings are still</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.920" end="00:15:51.280" style="s2">growing so there&#39;s no swarming off this</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.510" end="00:15:56.370" style="s2">rock quite yet well I would say it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.280" end="00:15:58.810" style="s2">a question of hacking and clutching and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.370" end="00:16:02.770" style="s2">that there are things you know one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.810" end="00:16:06.280" style="s2">the curious facts of modern life is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.770" end="00:16:08.500" style="s2">people your television you know think</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.280" end="00:16:11.170" style="s2">back to the 50s television in the living</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.500" end="00:16:13.450" style="s2">room is a window into lives that are not</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.170" end="00:16:16.690" style="s2">near you and you are a creature that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.450" end="00:16:18.520" style="s2">not programmed to deal with the ability</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.690" end="00:16:20.380" style="s2">to actually look in visually on a life</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.520" end="00:16:22.450" style="s2">that isn&#39;t near you looking in as always</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.380" end="00:16:23.650" style="s2">about proximity right you can describe a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.450" end="00:16:28.300" style="s2">life that&#39;s far away but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.650" end="00:16:30.580" style="s2">realistic we come to view some of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.300" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">people on our screens as if we know them</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.580" end="00:16:37.000" style="s2">and then now decades after this became</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:38.800" style="s2">commonplace we are now getting to know</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.000" end="00:16:40.690" style="s2">them and the fact is this relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.800" end="00:16:46.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t exactly a television relationship</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.690" end="00:16:49.060" style="s2">right so we are finding mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.360" end="00:16:52.420" style="s2">rebuild our humanity to each other in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.060" end="00:16:54.579" style="s2">way that actually is robust in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.420" end="00:16:55.959" style="s2">meantime it has fragile elements and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.579" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">have to be very careful to protect it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.959" end="00:17:02.920" style="s2">and things breaking down into you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:05.110" style="s2">clickbait discussions and things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.920" end="00:17:08.410" style="s2">that is very hazardous but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.110" end="00:17:10.540" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t I&#39;m not without hope about</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.410" end="00:17:11.980" style="s2">the process of us giving a damn about</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.540" end="00:17:14.410" style="s2">each other I actually think that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.980" end="00:17:16.839" style="s2">part can be done but we have to escape</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.410" end="00:17:18.549" style="s2">the things that are built in to upset it</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.839" end="00:17:20.530" style="s2">in order to get to a landscape where we</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.549" end="00:17:23.079" style="s2">do feel that way this is actually one of</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.530" end="00:17:25.959" style="s2">the things that livestream does as</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.079" end="00:17:29.169" style="s2">opposed to recorded and played later</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.959" end="00:17:30.580" style="s2">even for those who which is true for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.169" end="00:17:32.290" style="s2">vast majority of people who end up for</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.290" end="00:17:35.110" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the first missionary of</p>

<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:47.410" style="s2">brings us closer metaphorically and when</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.790" end="00:17:49.030" style="s2">people watch it later they know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.410" end="00:17:51.429" style="s2">there were there were more than just the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.030" end="00:17:52.809" style="s2">two of us participating here right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.429" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">even though you know we can&#39;t see your</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:58.390" style="s2">you&#39;re writing to each other right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.590" end="00:17:59.590" style="s2">but we know it&#39;s happening and you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.390" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">we&#39;ll get a little feedback from our mod</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.590" end="00:18:03.610" style="s2">afterwards as to how it went today but</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2">you know mostly that&#39;s that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.610" end="00:18:09.790" style="s2">beyond our ability to see but it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:12.370" style="s2">creating a kind of community the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.790" end="00:18:14.200" style="s2">that television piped end camp so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.370" end="00:18:16.179" style="s2">actually two things occur to me in this</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.200" end="00:18:19.030" style="s2">light one if there was a difference on</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.179" end="00:18:21.130" style="s2">Rogan this time to all the previous ones</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.030" end="00:18:23.140" style="s2">which was that this time Rogan has</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.130" end="00:18:25.900" style="s2">changed his podcast so that it is no</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.140" end="00:18:27.220" style="s2">longer live and I must say I didn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.900" end="00:18:29.620" style="s2">think about it I thought it was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.220" end="00:18:31.780" style="s2">trivial difference until he actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.620" end="00:18:33.610" style="s2">started and because he starts</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.780" end="00:18:35.049" style="s2">differently when it&#39;s live it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.610" end="00:18:37.419" style="s2">immediately jarring to know that it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.049" end="00:18:39.730" style="s2">just him and me in a room and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.419" end="00:18:42.580" style="s2">there&#39;s this principle that I say to</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.730" end="00:18:45.400" style="s2">people who are new to public life which</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.580" end="00:18:47.890" style="s2">is you&#39;ve got to remember the room is</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.400" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">not the room right the room is not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.890" end="00:18:53.260" style="s2">room you are in a room with somebody but</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:55.480" style="s2">the room maybe the internet or the world</p>

<p begin="00:18:55.480" end="00:18:59.260" style="s2">future if you say something now and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.490" end="00:19:01.510" style="s2">gets brought up then</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.260" end="00:19:04.720" style="s2">you have to be mindful of that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.510" end="00:19:07.120" style="s2">Rogen&#39;s room that gap the gap between</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.720" end="00:19:09.460" style="s2">the room you&#39;re in and the actual room</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.120" end="00:19:11.020" style="s2">is the maximum gap yep exactly right it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.460" end="00:19:12.850" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be bigger couldn&#39;t be built it</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.020" end="00:19:14.920" style="s2">there is no bigger at this point on</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.850" end="00:19:17.380" style="s2">earth and there&#39;s almost no smaller it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.920" end="00:19:18.310" style="s2">you and Joe and Jamie right or in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.380" end="00:19:20.170" style="s2">case that you and I were on together</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.310" end="00:19:22.780" style="s2">that you know the two of us and Joe and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.170" end="00:19:25.450" style="s2">Jamie it&#39;s a very small intimate room</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.780" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">that is outward looking to this gigantic</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.450" end="00:19:29.800" style="s2">thing and there&#39;s there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:31.600" style="s2">something in tangibly different your</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.800" end="00:19:34.300" style="s2">point about even if you arrived at this</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.600" end="00:19:36.430" style="s2">video you know a week from now you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.300" end="00:19:38.710" style="s2">that people were there live and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.430" end="00:19:40.330" style="s2">means that they sort of proxy for your</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.710" end="00:19:41.710" style="s2">reaction right</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.330" end="00:19:43.780" style="s2">whereas knowing that it went out</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.710" end="00:19:46.230" style="s2">afterwards and that it hit the internet</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.780" end="00:19:49.540" style="s2">all at once it has a very different</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.230" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">different impact so yeah somehow we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.540" end="00:19:52.750" style="s2">to think more carefully about how we</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">interface and start to bootstrap the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.750" end="00:20:00.250" style="s2">intimacy that we lost in the television</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:03.940" style="s2">and early internet eras very good we</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.250" end="00:20:05.620" style="s2">have a question from an editor of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:08.950" style="s2">major magazine in Slovenia who would</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.620" end="00:20:10.810" style="s2">like to get in touch with us Zack if you</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.950" end="00:20:14.050" style="s2">would highlight that somehow so we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.810" end="00:20:15.760" style="s2">try to get back to that what do you</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.050" end="00:20:19.300" style="s2">think of the theory that Tsarskoe v2</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.760" end="00:20:21.550" style="s2">originated in the Philippines I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.300" end="00:20:23.860" style="s2">heard that theory hypothesis so yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.550" end="00:20:25.540" style="s2">hypothesis is right I have not heard it</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.860" end="00:20:27.970" style="s2">either I would love to know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.540" end="00:20:30.790" style="s2">based upon yeah I need to don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.970" end="00:20:32.860" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t need to know more yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.790" end="00:20:35.200" style="s2">put it this way if it originated in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.860" end="00:20:39.190" style="s2">Philippines then we need an explanation</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:41.800" style="s2">of why it shows up in Wuhan in other</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.190" end="00:20:44.560" style="s2">words what would have to be true for</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.800" end="00:20:48.550" style="s2">that hypothesis to be likely is there</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.560" end="00:20:52.390" style="s2">would have to be a sequence divergence</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.550" end="00:20:53.800" style="s2">in a population of the virus early on in</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.390" end="00:20:56.740" style="s2">the Philippines what we don&#39;t see in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.800" end="00:20:58.420" style="s2">Wuhan is the fumbling around that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.740" end="00:20:59.980" style="s2">virus would be expected to do in its</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.420" end="00:21:01.930" style="s2">early phase after it had jumped to</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.980" end="00:21:04.120" style="s2">humans right well I mean unless unless</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.930" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">it was created the Philippines I moved</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.120" end="00:21:09.850" style="s2">to Wuhan you mean well here&#39;s to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:10.870" style="s2">talking about artificial oh I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.850" end="00:21:12.400" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it being</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.870" end="00:21:13.600" style="s2">artificially created</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.400" end="00:21:15.730" style="s2">all bets are off then yo could have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.600" end="00:21:18.310" style="s2">created anywhere yeah well if it was</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.730" end="00:21:21.400" style="s2">intentional right yes yes so anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.310" end="00:21:22.930" style="s2">would say before we dig a hole any</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.400" end="00:21:24.460" style="s2">deeper we got to figure out what this</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.930" end="00:21:26.590" style="s2">hypothesis is based on and whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.460" end="00:21:31.030" style="s2">there&#39;s anything to it but my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.590" end="00:21:33.370" style="s2">probably probably it&#39;s just noise okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.030" end="00:21:34.630" style="s2">so this person makes a statement and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.370" end="00:21:36.700" style="s2">then asked for our thoughts the</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.630" end="00:21:38.110" style="s2">statement is animals seek and find</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.700" end="00:21:40.690" style="s2">patterns whether they are there or not</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.110" end="00:21:45.220" style="s2">this pattern is a T plus agent issah T</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.290" end="00:21:51.430" style="s2">superstitions among humans give it</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.630" end="00:21:52.990" style="s2">enough time other animals will to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.430" end="00:21:55.750" style="s2">inevitably adopt religions before</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.990" end="00:21:57.850" style="s2">developing a meter that is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.750" end="00:22:03.040" style="s2">our scientific method what are your</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.850" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">thoughts I think there&#39;s too much loaded</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.040" end="00:22:07.270" style="s2">into the idea that superstitions</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:08.260" style="s2">superstition is the pathological version</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.270" end="00:22:10.690" style="s2">of something that is usually not</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.260" end="00:22:12.190" style="s2">pathological it is the detection of</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.690" end="00:22:14.410" style="s2">patterns whose explanation you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.190" end="00:22:17.080" style="s2">know but are nonetheless a useful</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.410" end="00:22:19.450" style="s2">indicator of something you sure you mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.080" end="00:22:22.660" style="s2">pathological it just seems a little</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.450" end="00:22:24.580" style="s2">strong no I mean it okay I mean and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.660" end="00:22:26.910" style="s2">don&#39;t maybe I don&#39;t mean it to have</p>

<p begin="00:22:26.910" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">maladaptive yeah lissa is the broken</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:38.500" style="s2">become reified as as aphorisms when</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.700" end="00:22:42.160" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong we call them superstitions</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.500" end="00:22:43.780" style="s2">right and patterns that occur for</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.160" end="00:22:46.030" style="s2">reasons you can&#39;t figure out but</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.780" end="00:22:48.010" style="s2">nonetheless help you limit the search</p>

<p begin="00:23:06.330" end="00:23:11.410" style="s2">component rather than the superstition</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.410" end="00:23:15.820" style="s2">helps you one time out of ten it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.090" end="00:23:21.550" style="s2">purely nonsense that&#39;s still a huge win</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.820" end="00:23:23.500" style="s2">so in any case animals do have a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.550" end="00:23:24.940" style="s2">superstition this has been demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.500" end="00:23:29.950" style="s2">in chickens I believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.940" end="00:23:31.989" style="s2">um where somebody basically set up a</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.950" end="00:23:34.989" style="s2">conveyor belt on which I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.989" end="00:23:37.479" style="s2">like rocks and corn were sent down in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.989" end="00:23:38.859" style="s2">random sequence so they used a random</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.479" end="00:23:40.330" style="s2">number generator to figure out whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.859" end="00:23:42.970" style="s2">the next thing on the belt was gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.330" end="00:23:44.440" style="s2">a rock or corn and patterns of course</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.970" end="00:23:46.119" style="s2">exists there that don&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.440" end="00:23:48.039" style="s2">you know a random sequence will have</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.119" end="00:23:49.960" style="s2">little patterns in it and the chickens</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.039" end="00:23:51.519" style="s2">would pick up expectation which you</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.960" end="00:23:54.729" style="s2">could tell they had by how long they</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.519" end="00:23:57.509" style="s2">looked based on patterns that just</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.729" end="00:24:00.070" style="s2">happened to be in the in the ya-ya</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.509" end="00:24:03.249" style="s2">misapprehension of pattern that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.070" end="00:24:06.669" style="s2">actually noise misapprehension of noise</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.249" end="00:24:09.809" style="s2">into pattern and then changing future</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.669" end="00:24:13.210" style="s2">behavior based on that yep</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.809" end="00:24:15.129" style="s2">hypothesis coronavirus was released</p>

<p begin="00:24:18.820" end="00:24:22.929" style="s2">similarly to high school shooters any</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.190" end="00:24:27.940" style="s2">thoughts how likely is this to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.929" end="00:24:29.979" style="s2">happened it is very difficult to rule</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.940" end="00:24:32.229" style="s2">something like that out but I would say</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.979" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">absent evidence of it one can drive</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.229" end="00:24:40.779" style="s2">themselves II let&#39;s put it this way in</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:43.450" style="s2">general human beings behave semi</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.779" end="00:24:45.099" style="s2">rationally which means that we can infer</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.450" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">something about why people do things</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.099" end="00:24:47.950" style="s2">based on the fact that it would make</p>

<p begin="00:24:52.330" end="00:24:56.710" style="s2">know there&#39;s always a question and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.669" end="00:24:59.289" style="s2">has changed some of these shooters don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.710" end="00:25:01.509" style="s2">die yeah event anymore what to change</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.289" end="00:25:03.580" style="s2">histologic substantially but if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.509" end="00:25:05.950" style="s2">is going to engage in mayhem that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.580" end="00:25:07.359" style="s2">going to end their life there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.950" end="00:25:09.759" style="s2">question about whether or not they had</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.359" end="00:25:12.009" style="s2">decided to commit suicide first and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.759" end="00:25:13.539" style="s2">decided to add some mayhem to it or if</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.539" end="00:25:17.979" style="s2">then accepted the loss of their life</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:02.549" style="s2">something and then he gets to complain</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.549" end="00:28:07.109" style="s2">his authority even though this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.259" end="00:28:09.720" style="s2">needs to end then that potentially</p>

<p begin="00:28:12.210" end="00:28:19.979" style="s2">continues to feed to feed Trump more</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.379" end="00:28:21.179" style="s2">more approval yep I think there are a</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.979" end="00:28:23.820" style="s2">lot of games that could be played for</p>

<p begin="00:28:25.080" end="00:28:29.369" style="s2">recently it&#39;s possible that the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.960" end="00:28:31.859" style="s2">to get Trump to do something that will</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.369" end="00:28:35.190" style="s2">be unpopular in certain places and will</p>

<p begin="00:29:37.169" end="00:29:41.820" style="s2">a green future all sorts of nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.179" end="00:29:43.349" style="s2">yeah yeah he&#39;s got a lot of wishy-washy</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.820" end="00:29:45.839" style="s2">stuff to say on climate change a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.349" end="00:29:47.849" style="s2">position that we have a lot of thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.839" end="00:29:48.420" style="s2">on as well and I just wish that we had</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.849" end="00:29:51.090" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.420" end="00:29:54.450" style="s2">there&#39;s on this front how dare he be the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.090" end="00:29:55.830" style="s2">guy that&#39;s like and I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.450" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">carrying that flag yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.830" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">so ballistic rapid clown yeah excellent</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.090" end="00:30:03.180" style="s2">how do we determine if the collateral</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:05.400" style="s2">damage of the protests and/or local</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.180" end="00:30:06.810" style="s2">culture is worth it we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.400" end="00:30:09.210" style="s2">the Black Panthers were necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.810" end="00:30:12.270" style="s2">MLK to be more palatable what if all</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.210" end="00:30:13.470" style="s2">this works it&#39;s really the second part</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.270" end="00:30:16.830" style="s2">of that is not something I&#39;d put</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.470" end="00:30:17.790" style="s2">together that the the connection I what</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.830" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2">you know one thing that immediately</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.790" end="00:30:24.060" style="s2">jumps out at me here is we don&#39;t have I</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.240" end="00:30:26.910" style="s2">mean we do have many people who could be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.060" end="00:30:28.650" style="s2">doing the work of MLK but what we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.910" end="00:30:30.630" style="s2">at the moment is if this if this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.650" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">right this analogy is right the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.630" end="00:30:35.190" style="s2">equivalent of the Black Panthers taking</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:36.780" style="s2">over and becoming the dominant voice and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.190" end="00:30:39.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not that they&#39;re covering for</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.780" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">something else like who are the voices</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.270" end="00:30:44.940" style="s2">that are actually making making the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:47.610" style="s2">correct arguments for police reform and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.940" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">you know lingering effects of racism in</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.610" end="00:30:53.330" style="s2">the courts and such so I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:57.120" style="s2">troubled by this question because the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.330" end="00:31:00.210" style="s2">movement itself cannot mature into</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.120" end="00:31:02.280" style="s2">something meaningful it is too convinced</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.210" end="00:31:06.180" style="s2">of wrong things and what we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.280" end="00:31:08.370" style="s2">in the horizontal nosov it&#39;s exercises</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.180" end="00:31:10.530" style="s2">of power the fact that it is toppling</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.370" end="00:31:13.220" style="s2">institutions from within and causing</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.530" end="00:31:13.220" style="s2">them to start</p>

<p begin="00:31:18.900" end="00:31:23.010" style="s2">turned off the people inside those</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.460" end="00:31:28.470" style="s2">institutions are confused and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.010" end="00:31:30.510" style="s2">not going to become unconvincing has to</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.470" end="00:31:33.810" style="s2">rein in their confusion even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.510" end="00:31:35.970" style="s2">ultimately as I&#39;ve been advocating as</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.810" end="00:31:40.410" style="s2">loudly as I can even if we deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.970" end="00:31:42.090" style="s2">fundamental I&#39;m I can&#39;t even say</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.410" end="00:31:44.340" style="s2">inequity anymore because they&#39;ve robbed</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.090" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">us of the term equity but even if the</p>

<p begin="00:33:43.399" end="00:33:47.869" style="s2">there are four terms running around for</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.379" end="00:33:49.639" style="s2">exactly the same location and people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.869" end="00:33:51.950" style="s2">being shot there&#39;s a pretty good chance</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.639" end="00:33:54.109" style="s2">you don&#39;t really know how civilization</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.950" end="00:33:56.239" style="s2">works and you&#39;re not the people to whom</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.109" end="00:33:57.710" style="s2">it should be handed over this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.239" end="00:33:59.720" style="s2">one of the things that happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.710" end="00:34:01.009" style="s2">abandon the idea of leaders and this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.720" end="00:34:03.109" style="s2">you know what what you&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.009" end="00:34:06.109" style="s2">now and Joe Rogan and elsewhere and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.109" end="00:34:07.820" style="s2">here this is what you saw what we saw</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.109" end="00:34:10.849" style="s2">but do you saw more intimately with</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.820" end="00:34:13.669" style="s2">occupy yeah that from the beginning it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.849" end="00:34:16.429" style="s2">was understood to be leaderless by</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.669" end="00:34:18.530" style="s2">intention but the leader lessness was of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.429" end="00:34:21.319" style="s2">course gamed as it will always will be</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.530" end="00:34:23.780" style="s2">as it always will be so the final answer</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.319" end="00:34:26.389" style="s2">to that question though is the movement</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.780" end="00:34:28.429" style="s2">cannot build the movement however is</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.389" end="00:34:30.319" style="s2">scaring the crap out of people so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.429" end="00:34:32.869" style="s2">they may be ready to hear something that</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.319" end="00:34:35.000" style="s2">many could not hear before and so to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.869" end="00:34:37.399" style="s2">extent that a bunch of us are scrambling</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.000" end="00:34:39.079" style="s2">trying to point out what the actual</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.399" end="00:34:40.609" style="s2">meaning of this moment is and what needs</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.079" end="00:34:43.909" style="s2">to happen in order to prevent us from</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.609" end="00:34:46.730" style="s2">sliding into a Maoist takeover which to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.909" end="00:34:49.450" style="s2">which we seem to be headed that might</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.730" end="00:34:53.270" style="s2">open the door to positive change and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.450" end="00:34:54.919" style="s2">am loathe to give credit to people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.270" end="00:35:00.069" style="s2">have threatened the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.919" end="00:35:02.869" style="s2">civilization in order to move things but</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.069" end="00:35:04.940" style="s2">if we get there I guess we can fight</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.869" end="00:35:06.890" style="s2">about how to how to address the history</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.940" end="00:35:08.390" style="s2">yeah okay we&#39;re gonna do two more</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.890" end="00:35:10.490" style="s2">questions from this and then switch to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.390" end="00:35:13.039" style="s2">the other the super chat from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.490" end="00:35:14.270" style="s2">current livestream this one is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.039" end="00:35:15.950" style="s2">two-part question you&#39;ve consistently</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.270" end="00:35:18.140" style="s2">described elements of the protest as</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.950" end="00:35:19.910" style="s2">Maoist are you aware that Steve ban and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.140" end="00:35:22.430" style="s2">other and others like him are used in</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.910" end="00:35:24.170" style="s2">the exact same term second question in</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.430" end="00:35:25.880" style="s2">describing protests as Maoist what</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.170" end="00:35:27.650" style="s2">incentive do protesters and sympathizers</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.880" end="00:35:29.390" style="s2">have to listen with an open mind to your</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.650" end="00:35:32.299" style="s2">perspective how does it encourage</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.390" end="00:35:33.980" style="s2">rational engagement our compromise so to</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.299" end="00:35:35.869" style="s2">the first question I didn&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.980" end="00:35:37.549" style="s2">Steve Bannon and others like him</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.869" end="00:35:38.540" style="s2">whatever that means exactly are using</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.549" end="00:35:40.820" style="s2">the exact same term</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.540" end="00:35:43.640" style="s2">and I&#39;m no fan of Steve Bannon but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.820" end="00:35:45.380" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter it does it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.640" end="00:35:46.940" style="s2">if people who are actually you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.380" end="00:35:49.310" style="s2">hateful and I&#39;m not saying that Steve</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.940" end="00:35:50.930" style="s2">Bannon is but you know it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.310" end="00:35:52.280" style="s2">if people who are completely hateful</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.930" end="00:35:53.810" style="s2">come to the same conclusion that you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.280" end="00:35:56.900" style="s2">that does not render your conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.810" end="00:35:58.730" style="s2">false well and you know if you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.900" end="00:36:02.030" style="s2">to behave in a Maoist fashion and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.730" end="00:36:04.130" style="s2">problem is we&#39;re left grasping for</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.030" end="00:36:05.870" style="s2">alternatives it&#39;s so Maoist it&#39;s so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.130" end="00:36:08.450" style="s2">know struggle sessions have emerged we</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.870" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">need to invent some other personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.450" end="00:36:11.780" style="s2">euphemism that Steve Bannon won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:13.910" style="s2">heard of in order that he won&#39;t settle</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.780" end="00:36:15.020" style="s2">on the same formulation it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.910" end="00:36:17.510" style="s2">know history history doesn&#39;t repeat</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.020" end="00:36:20.420" style="s2">itself but it it works right so you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.510" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">do we have a red guard not exactly you</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.420" end="00:36:24.260" style="s2">know is it is it exactly to a pert you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:28.250" style="s2">know to it to a detail struggle sessions</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.260" end="00:36:30.590" style="s2">no but you know of all of the possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.250" end="00:36:31.820" style="s2">comparisons and we we listed a few of</p>

<p begin="00:36:34.610" end="00:36:38.840" style="s2">the weird that you know the 4500 words</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.040" end="00:36:40.370" style="s2">the longest piece that we&#39;ve written</p>

<p begin="00:36:47.360" end="00:36:51.190" style="s2">the French Revolution is the brown</p>

<p begin="00:36:53.480" end="00:37:00.380" style="s2">of each and really the closest one that</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.460" end="00:37:01.910" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen and you know either of us are</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.380" end="00:37:04.070" style="s2">historians and I&#39;m sure we&#39;re missing a</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.130" end="00:37:11.810" style="s2">the 60s and to the extent that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.500" end="00:37:14.120" style="s2">question about does this lead to</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.810" end="00:37:15.880" style="s2">openness on the part of those behaving</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:29.420" style="s2">to the extent that they start hearing an</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.420" end="00:37:32.390" style="s2">they don&#39;t know anything about it maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.680" end="00:37:34.130" style="s2">they&#39;ll look it up and they will notice</p>

<p begin="00:37:34.130" end="00:37:39.170" style="s2">and they&#39;ll think that&#39;s odd mm-hmm I</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.220" end="00:37:46.400" style="s2">the extent that one could plant a seed</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.720" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">that got them to look up something</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.400" end="00:37:51.500" style="s2">useful the parallel is too close to be</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.500" end="00:37:55.790" style="s2">I mean we get into this too with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.350" end="00:37:58.520" style="s2">know the lab leak hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.790" end="00:38:00.860" style="s2">Trump has politicized the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.520" end="00:38:04.280" style="s2">maybe this came from the Institute of</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.860" end="00:38:06.260" style="s2">virality what are we to do not talk</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.280" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">about it because Trump has some thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.260" end="00:38:10.130" style="s2">that overlaps sort of with what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:11.990" style="s2">saying this is anti science yes is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.130" end="00:38:15.260" style="s2">is dismissing ideas on the basis that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.990" end="00:38:17.450" style="s2">someone else who believes it is is</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.260" end="00:38:18.830" style="s2">hateful or antithetical to the cause</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.450" end="00:38:21.800" style="s2">that you believe in this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.830" end="00:38:24.940" style="s2">explicitly anti-scientific i will say</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.800" end="00:38:28.700" style="s2">that in the last couple of weeks i asked</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.940" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">some friends for their suggestions as to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.700" end="00:38:32.990" style="s2">how to learn more about the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:35.290" style="s2">revolution because i read a bit decades</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.990" end="00:38:39.080" style="s2">ago when i was in high school in college</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.290" end="00:38:40.580" style="s2">and really haven&#39;t gone back recently so</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.080" end="00:38:43.540" style="s2">as you as you know i&#39;ve got this pile of</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.580" end="00:38:47.240" style="s2">books now waiting for me to dig in and</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.540" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">you know i I&#39;ve poked in a few places</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.240" end="00:38:53.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard not to act as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">verification ax straight it&#39;s hard not</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.540" end="00:38:57.740" style="s2">to just see the confirming examples and</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:39:00.620" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do the falsification a</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.740" end="00:39:02.300" style="s2">thing that we always try to do but so</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.620" end="00:39:06.620" style="s2">far and I&#39;m not very far into any of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.300" end="00:39:08.660" style="s2">them I am I am more affirmed in my sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.620" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">that this looks more like China in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.660" end="00:39:12.950" style="s2">sixties than any of these other examples</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:14.210" style="s2">that we have yeah and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.950" end="00:39:15.500" style="s2">good that you&#39;ve got the books and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.210" end="00:39:19.840" style="s2">think we know they&#39;re not gonna burn</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.500" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">themselves so certainly hope not</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.840" end="00:39:25.220" style="s2">self-immolating books great hey that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:27.170" style="s2">thing oh yay okay one more from this</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.220" end="00:39:29.060" style="s2">live stream then I will switch the next</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.170" end="00:39:31.490" style="s2">one what do you think about youth sports</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.060" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">commencing kids need a lot of activity</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.490" end="00:39:34.910" style="s2">and seem relatively safe from severe</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:39.680" style="s2">cases could also help get them more</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.910" end="00:39:41.900" style="s2">vitamin D yeah III think this should be</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.680" end="00:39:43.670" style="s2">happening and there is risk there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.900" end="00:39:48.980" style="s2">risk than if the kids are just hanging</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.670" end="00:39:51.530" style="s2">out alone it is but I think that risk is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.980" end="00:39:53.570" style="s2">pretty low you know I put the school</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.530" end="00:39:56.180" style="s2">near us that we take walks up to with a</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.570" end="00:39:59.600" style="s2">dog and sometimes play speed mitten and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.180" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">such in the in the field there the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.600" end="00:40:04.420" style="s2">playground is just it&#39;s heartbreaking</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:06.310" style="s2">you see single kids</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.420" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">you know throwing a basketball into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.310" end="00:40:10.480" style="s2">hoop and and the play structures</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:13.930" style="s2">themselves for the younger kids are</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.480" end="00:40:15.580" style="s2">roped off with caution tape and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.930" end="00:40:18.040" style="s2">the the playgrounds isn&#39;t about youth</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.580" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">sports but I know that our youngest a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.040" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">younger son in particular would so</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:26.230" style="s2">benefit from being able to run around in</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:28.750" style="s2">a coordinated fashion and and and play</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.230" end="00:40:31.690" style="s2">and engage physically with other people</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.750" end="00:40:33.340" style="s2">that this would be a huge boon and does</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.690" end="00:40:37.330" style="s2">it come with risk yeah but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.340" end="00:40:40.270" style="s2">risk is low yep I think the real risk is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.330" end="00:40:43.780" style="s2">the downstream the kids seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.270" end="00:40:47.470" style="s2">relatively safe even when they get the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.780" end="00:40:49.000" style="s2">infection and the likelihood of getting</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.470" end="00:40:51.130" style="s2">the infection outdoor during the day I</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.000" end="00:40:53.230" style="s2">would say maybe limit the you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.130" end="00:40:55.030" style="s2">competitive play two times from the sun</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.230" end="00:40:57.370" style="s2">is shining because you know then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.030" end="00:40:59.530" style="s2">got the benefit of the UV but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.370" end="00:41:01.180" style="s2">also other things that you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.530" end="00:41:04.420" style="s2">aren&#39;t organized sports that would have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.180" end="00:41:06.520" style="s2">almost no risk and so anyway I will end</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.420" end="00:41:09.220" style="s2">up talking more about this device later</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.520" end="00:41:11.380" style="s2">but if you have the resources you might</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.220" end="00:41:12.490" style="s2">get your kids electric unicycles and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.380" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">they could go learn them and that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.490" end="00:41:16.510" style="s2">occupy them for a month or two as</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:17.740" style="s2">they&#39;re learning it and then they can go</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.510" end="00:41:20.260" style="s2">adventure and the thing is it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.740" end="00:41:22.330" style="s2">high volume of air that passes by you so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.260" end="00:41:24.520" style="s2">you can have fun with other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.330" end="00:41:28.210" style="s2">without being right up in their faces</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.520" end="00:41:34.120" style="s2">and there&#39;s also I think you&#39;ve heard a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.210" end="00:41:35.860" style="s2">bit a bicycle that&#39;s like - yeah yeah</p>

<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:42:59.350" style="s2">orienting reflux plays a role in how</p>

<p begin="00:42:59.350" end="00:43:02.830" style="s2">I believe it was a Russian psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:06.340" style="s2">that professor Peterson referenced in</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.830" end="00:43:08.320" style="s2">his first book who discovered it I am</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.340" end="00:43:13.420" style="s2">not familiar with the orienting reflex</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.320" end="00:43:17.680" style="s2">and I have also not read Jordan&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.420" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">book yeah I should have so I don&#39;t know</p>

<p begin="00:43:36.850" end="00:43:39.970" style="s2">there&#39;s some pieces in there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.840" end="00:43:42.010" style="s2">quite get but it&#39;s a it&#39;s incentivizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.970" end="00:43:45.190" style="s2">you know incentivizing not having kids</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.010" end="00:43:49.270" style="s2">young and I think you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.190" end="00:43:52.330" style="s2">financial incentives to to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.270" end="00:43:54.280" style="s2">behavior that is societally beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.330" end="00:43:56.170" style="s2">has a long history it is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.280" end="00:43:58.180" style="s2">troubled but it often works and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:43:59.890" style="s2">think there&#39;s anything wrong with it in</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.180" end="00:44:02.170" style="s2">theory and something like this could</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.890" end="00:44:04.540" style="s2">work what is the joke there&#39;s no joke</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.170" end="00:44:06.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a very sad moment the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.540" end="00:44:07.720" style="s2">that a proposal like that which I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.400" end="00:44:09.220" style="s2">know about the details of the proposal</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.720" end="00:44:11.530" style="s2">but the basic idea is that we should</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.220" end="00:44:14.530" style="s2">incentivize the behavior that we think</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.530" end="00:44:18.160" style="s2">is valuable and unfortunately this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.530" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">why BLM has taken up arms against a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.160" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">nuclear family rendering this proposal</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:26.650" style="s2">racist mmm so the question is how can we</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:28.000" style="s2">bootstrap our way out of the little trap</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.650" end="00:44:29.590" style="s2">that&#39;s been set for us where we can</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.000" end="00:44:30.200" style="s2">start to talk about what&#39;s actually good</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.590" end="00:44:33.109" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.200" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">get it to more people yeah so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.109" end="00:44:37.250" style="s2">puzzle but anyway the idea of incentives</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:39.349" style="s2">to lead us in the direction of things</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.250" end="00:44:45.260" style="s2">that are actually beneficial of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.349" end="00:44:47.270" style="s2">mm-hmm all right we get pick the one you</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.260" end="00:44:49.010" style="s2">like most we got three options and four</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.270" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">different questions pick the one you</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.010" end="00:44:54.410" style="s2">like most one so we&#39;re gonna answer one</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.920" end="00:44:56.420" style="s2">of these questions okay idea does</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.410" end="00:44:59.210" style="s2">globalization make us vulnerable to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.420" end="00:45:00.829" style="s2">invasive species like ideas mind viruses</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.210" end="00:45:03.470" style="s2">if you will and how do we incentivize</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.829" end="00:45:05.030" style="s2">info businesses to localize for now</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.470" end="00:45:07.520" style="s2">trying to get most users is the only</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.030" end="00:45:09.530" style="s2">winning strategy it&#39;s one option to</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.520" end="00:45:11.720" style="s2">should we want healthy competition among</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.530" end="00:45:14.900" style="s2">nations and if so how do we make it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.720" end="00:45:16.849" style="s2">happen three let&#39;s steal man the rule</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.900" end="00:45:19.310" style="s2">all whites should be considered racist</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.849" end="00:45:21.890" style="s2">properly I guess you know about false</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.310" end="00:45:24.530" style="s2">positives and false negatives so which</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.890" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">one of those do you want to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.530" end="00:45:28.220" style="s2">first one yeah okay so let me just</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.240" end="00:45:29.540" style="s2">repeat it does globalization make us</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.220" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">vulnerable to invasive species like</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.540" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">ideas maybe mind viruses and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:37.010" style="s2">incentivize info businesses to localize</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:41.990" style="s2">for now trying to get the most users is</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.010" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">the only winning strategy yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.990" end="00:45:46.280" style="s2">definitely a problem it is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:48.680" style="s2">challenge to something I have sadly</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.280" end="00:45:51.770" style="s2">advocated which is that maybe it is time</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.680" end="00:45:53.990" style="s2">for us to have a global language that</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.770" end="00:45:55.630" style="s2">the danger of speaking languages that</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.990" end="00:45:57.950" style="s2">are distinct and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.630" end="00:45:59.810" style="s2">miscommunicating or having lower</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.950" end="00:46:01.220" style="s2">precision communication when something</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.810" end="00:46:04.130" style="s2">important is at stake is something we</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.220" end="00:46:06.230" style="s2">can no longer afford and the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.130" end="00:46:07.780" style="s2">plugging us all into the same language</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.230" end="00:46:10.700" style="s2">is obviously going to make the invasive</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.780" end="00:46:13.040" style="s2">idea problem worse yeah on the other</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.700" end="00:46:16.420" style="s2">hand it&#39;s harder to hide I think we do</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.040" end="00:46:20.750" style="s2">know the solution to invasive bad ideas</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.420" end="00:46:24.319" style="s2">the solution is high quality critical</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.750" end="00:46:26.569" style="s2">thinking skills and we do a really</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.319" end="00:46:29.030" style="s2">terrible job of passing these on even in</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.569" end="00:46:32.150" style="s2">the good neighborhoods we don&#39;t teach</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.030" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">this all right we teach something much</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.150" end="00:46:36.740" style="s2">more mundane much more targeted at</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.599" style="s2">turning people into cogs to operate</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.740" end="00:46:40.280" style="s2">machines that we frankly no longer even</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.599" end="00:46:41.630" style="s2">use maybe especially in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.280" end="00:46:43.250" style="s2">because in the so-called good</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.630" end="00:46:46.150" style="s2">neighborhoods the education is still</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.250" end="00:46:50.359" style="s2">pretty crappy yep private schools being</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.150" end="00:46:53.150" style="s2">partial exception but at least in</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.359" end="00:46:55.550" style="s2">neighborhoods that are you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.150" end="00:46:56.540" style="s2">frankly more dangerous kids end up with</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.550" end="00:46:58.310" style="s2">some street smarts</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.540" end="00:47:00.920" style="s2">they end up knowing some things about</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.310" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">how things operate in a way that frankly</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.920" end="00:47:05.900" style="s2">the pretty privileged kids who are</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:08.359" style="s2">mostly behind the riots and speaking on</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.900" end="00:47:10.130" style="s2">behalf of a bunch of people who they</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.359" end="00:47:12.440" style="s2">mostly have never met don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.130" end="00:47:14.840" style="s2">anything about yeah it&#39;s mostly led by</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.440" end="00:47:17.390" style="s2">people who actually don&#39;t have the life</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.840" end="00:47:19.670" style="s2">experience of knowing either critical</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.390" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">thinking or actually like physical</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.670" end="00:47:23.390" style="s2">engagement with the world and form of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:27.410" style="s2">craft or something yeah so we should be</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.390" end="00:47:30.170" style="s2">doing a lot more physical skills in</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.410" end="00:47:33.830" style="s2">education where and this has been a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.170" end="00:47:36.710" style="s2">mantra for for both of us where there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.830" end="00:47:37.640" style="s2">no judgment necessary on the part of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.710" end="00:47:38.810" style="s2">human being</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.640" end="00:47:40.730" style="s2">in order to figure out whether you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.810" end="00:47:42.440" style="s2">succeeded or failed Yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.730" end="00:47:44.300" style="s2">when you&#39;re juggling you know if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.440" end="00:47:48.020" style="s2">dropped the balls right it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.300" end="00:47:50.030" style="s2">not a judgment call so engagement with</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.020" end="00:47:51.920" style="s2">those kinds of skills teaches the mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.030" end="00:47:54.220" style="s2">to think and teaching the mind to think</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.920" end="00:47:56.990" style="s2">is like teaching it to spot</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.220" end="00:48:00.410" style="s2">nice-sounding wrong ideas and if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.990" end="00:48:01.730" style="s2">one reason to be absolutely frightened</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.410" end="00:48:03.800" style="s2">of what&#39;s taking place in our streets</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.730" end="00:48:05.540" style="s2">it&#39;s the impression that the people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.800" end="00:48:08.839" style="s2">are telling us what needs to happen next</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.540" end="00:48:10.490" style="s2">do not have the basics with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.839" end="00:48:14.359" style="s2">understanding what might work and what</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.490" end="00:48:17.450" style="s2">will definitely not yeah one more thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.359" end="00:48:19.270" style="s2">on this question I do think picking up</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.450" end="00:48:21.830" style="s2">on your point about a global language</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.270" end="00:48:22.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s never it&#39;s never set right</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.830" end="00:48:24.290" style="s2">with me I know it doesn&#39;t sit right with</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.760" end="00:48:27.430" style="s2">you either you&#39;ve advocated it how you</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.290" end="00:48:27.430" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t like it</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.930" end="00:48:34.820" style="s2">one-one cost of it that I hadn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.339" end="00:48:38.570" style="s2">considered is that it does make outposts</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.820" end="00:48:42.619" style="s2">more difficult places where interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.570" end="00:48:44.900" style="s2">ideas can hide and people can not be</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.619" end="00:48:47.210" style="s2">exposed to bad ideas but also hide out</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.900" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">and discuss you know discuss the values</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.210" end="00:48:51.470" style="s2">that are coming in and sort of wall</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:53.839" style="s2">themselves off and you know it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.470" end="00:48:54.040" style="s2">people who have loved exploring a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.839" end="00:48:55.990" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.040" end="00:48:57.780" style="s2">world both through doing our research</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.990" end="00:48:59.740" style="s2">and through just just traveling</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.780" end="00:49:02.890" style="s2">certainly the fact of people speaking</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.740" end="00:49:04.990" style="s2">different languages has been often more</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.890" end="00:49:06.790" style="s2">often a barrier than something alluring</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.990" end="00:49:08.680" style="s2">is neither of us are particularly adept</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.790" end="00:49:11.290" style="s2">in picking up new languages</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.680" end="00:49:13.330" style="s2">whereas making friends with a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.290" end="00:49:14.740" style="s2">of language and experiencing food and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.330" end="00:49:16.870" style="s2">different cultural events think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.740" end="00:49:20.560" style="s2">all of you super easy and wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.870" end="00:49:24.490" style="s2">for us and it&#39;s one of the values of of</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.560" end="00:49:26.380" style="s2">travel but language in part because it</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.490" end="00:49:27.310" style="s2">does keep us separate is also therefore</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.380" end="00:49:31.270" style="s2">protective</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.310" end="00:49:34.630" style="s2">multiple languages yep I agree there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.270" end="00:49:36.040" style="s2">trade off yeah Brett you said it would</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.630" end="00:49:40.990" style="s2">be hard for you and Sam Harris to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.040" end="00:49:44.860" style="s2">psychedelics together dude it would be</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.990" end="00:49:47.140" style="s2">for anybody who was with us yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.860" end="00:49:49.240" style="s2">that question came about someone asked</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.140" end="00:49:52.600" style="s2">if you and me and Sam Harris and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.240" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">Peterson would consider doing doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.600" end="00:49:56.620" style="s2">psychedelics together to address the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:58.420" style="s2">problems of the world and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.620" end="00:50:00.010" style="s2">arrived at like hopefully Jordan I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.420" end="00:50:01.060" style="s2">go hang out and talk because you and say</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.010" end="00:50:05.050" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna be doing something that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.060" end="00:50:06.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to so the second part the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.050" end="00:50:09.490" style="s2">question is do you two have some</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.040" end="00:50:12.600" style="s2">disagreements or things to work out we</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.490" end="00:50:14.500" style="s2">have I think a very small number of very</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.600" end="00:50:16.780" style="s2">significant disagreements that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.500" end="00:50:20.770" style="s2">unfortunately haunt all of the stuff on</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.780" end="00:50:22.390" style="s2">which we might otherwise make progress</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.770" end="00:50:25.480" style="s2">so I&#39;d actually like to solve that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.390" end="00:50:29.320" style="s2">problem yeah but you know no I just</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.480" end="00:50:32.020" style="s2">think I I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never seen Sam</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.320" end="00:50:34.560" style="s2">on psychedelics but I have the sense</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.020" end="00:50:37.090" style="s2">that the two of you would become</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.560" end="00:50:38.220" style="s2">wall-like and not getting anywhere with</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.090" end="00:50:40.630" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.220" end="00:50:42.880" style="s2">yes it would be frankly more frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.630" end="00:50:44.350" style="s2">for the other people in the room but</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.880" end="00:50:46.390" style="s2">maybe for you you might you might have</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.350" end="00:50:51.070" style="s2">grateful to say actually it would depend</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.390" end="00:50:53.980" style="s2">a lot on what psychedelic often yes no I</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.070" end="00:50:57.010" style="s2">mean it just makes a difference yangyang</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.980" end="00:51:00.490" style="s2">we&#39;re told I&#39;m all right yeah I do you</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.010" end="00:51:03.010" style="s2">want to say anything about having put</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.490" end="00:51:05.260" style="s2">forth the Dark Horse duo hypothesis on</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.300" end="00:51:13.250" style="s2">episode nineteen and have watched our</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.130" end="00:51:17.270" style="s2">stream fail spectacularly on the mention</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.250" end="00:51:20.950" style="s2">of William McRaven but in any case I</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.270" end="00:51:23.900" style="s2">advanced the Dark Horse duo plan</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.950" end="00:51:26.810" style="s2">separate from the people who I proposed</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.900" end="00:51:29.600" style="s2">as the inhabitants of the plan on Joe</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.600" end="00:51:34.520" style="s2">positive feedback I&#39;m very heartened</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.970" end="00:51:36.230" style="s2">people are energized by the idea I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.520" end="00:51:38.240" style="s2">they even though we didn&#39;t talk that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.230" end="00:51:40.370" style="s2">much about what problems it solves they</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.240" end="00:51:43.550" style="s2">seem to intuit what problems it solves</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.370" end="00:51:46.100" style="s2">and so anyway I think the hard part is</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.550" end="00:51:50.060" style="s2">that we actually have to draft either</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.100" end="00:51:51.260" style="s2">these two people or other people into</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.060" end="00:51:53.780" style="s2">the proposal there aren&#39;t that many</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.260" end="00:51:55.310" style="s2">people who would be good I think these</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.780" end="00:51:57.530" style="s2">are the right two people if they will do</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.310" end="00:52:00.770" style="s2">it but they&#39;re not going to sign on to a</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.230" end="00:52:34.700" style="s2">think it should and anyway we can say</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.140" end="00:52:36.350" style="s2">more about it later but keep the</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.700" end="00:52:38.810" style="s2">pressure going and spread the word and</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.350" end="00:54:52.690" style="s2">behavior is the category of mind viruses</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.950" end="00:54:55.420" style="s2">that can invade our society is it useful</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.420" end="00:55:10.660" style="s2">inherently make you bad so there you</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.340" end="00:55:12.580" style="s2">know there are bad things that can be</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.660" end="00:55:14.680" style="s2">successful and good things as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.580" end="00:55:16.210" style="s2">I would say the problem is that most</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.680" end="00:55:18.880" style="s2">often what you&#39;re looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.210" end="00:55:21.670" style="s2">something that serves the individual or</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.880" end="00:55:23.920" style="s2">some small entity at cost</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.670" end="00:55:25.930" style="s2">to the larger population that spreads</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.920" end="00:55:29.289" style="s2">because of that conflict which is not</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.930" end="00:55:31.390" style="s2">really virus like unless you think of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.289" end="00:55:33.099" style="s2">almost makes the individual virus like</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.390" end="00:55:35.109" style="s2">it&#39;s not a perfect analogy</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.099" end="00:55:38.140" style="s2">so there are truly bad ideas that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.109" end="00:55:40.480" style="s2">kind of contagious like I&#39;ve got if I</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.140" end="00:55:43.180" style="s2">say Pokemon go are we gonna lose half</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.480" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">the people who listen it&#39;s okay um you</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.180" end="00:55:49.390" style="s2">know playing Pokemon go that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:51.970" style="s2">for you at expense to society it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.390" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">for everybody involved and addictive</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.970" end="00:56:00.269" style="s2">right so that&#39;s kind of my envira see</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:56:02.760" style="s2">why is the boy I don&#39;t know this term</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.269" end="00:56:06.250" style="s2">maybe you do Brett the Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.760" end="00:56:07.150" style="s2">why is the Gini coefficient it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.250" end="00:56:09.880" style="s2">this one</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.150" end="00:56:11.799" style="s2">yeah I see why is the Gini coefficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.880" end="00:56:13.960" style="s2">not part of the conversation even though</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.799" end="00:56:16.690" style="s2">it explains clearly the inequality that</p>

<p begin="00:56:22.779" end="00:56:26.109" style="s2">coefficient is and without it I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.000" end="00:56:28.329" style="s2">gonna be able to answer this question</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.569" end="00:56:58.390" style="s2">orgs like curecoin demonstrated it 300</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.180" end="00:56:59.740" style="s2">science projects away incentives sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.390" end="00:57:01.779" style="s2">falls out there do you know much about</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.740" end="00:57:03.160" style="s2">this a little bit I mean the hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.779" end="00:57:06.940" style="s2">with us about it let&#39;s put it to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.160" end="00:57:09.099" style="s2">this way it&#39;s the right idea the you</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.940" end="00:57:12.099" style="s2">know to bootstrap some mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.099" end="00:57:14.109" style="s2">can think straight by being independent</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.099" end="00:57:14.880" style="s2">of the corrupt institutions is the right</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.109" end="00:57:18.339" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.880" end="00:57:20.500" style="s2">some kind of crypto currency connection</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.339" end="00:57:21.130" style="s2">that allows this thing to get funded the</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.500" end="00:57:23.259" style="s2">right idea</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.130" end="00:57:25.059" style="s2">also anyway it&#39;s one of a number of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.259" end="00:57:29.799" style="s2">projects that has that basic framework</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.059" end="00:57:31.569" style="s2">and I have got some people lined up to</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.799" end="00:57:34.000" style="s2">come on the podcast to talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.569" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">version which is not inherently science</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.000" end="00:57:37.880" style="s2">oriented although I see</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:38.450" style="s2">no reason that it could not be utilized</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.880" end="00:57:42.200" style="s2">for it</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.450" end="00:57:45.160" style="s2">so anyway an upcoming episode we&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.200" end="00:57:47.240" style="s2">that discussion wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.160" end="00:57:48.920" style="s2">Trump has publicly gathered black</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.240" end="00:57:51.380" style="s2">leaders to talk and enact realistic</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.920" end="00:57:53.960" style="s2">reforms as Brett said he would do do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.380" end="00:57:55.460" style="s2">believe do you believe your own</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.960" end="00:57:58.999" style="s2">political biases are keeping you from</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.460" end="00:58:00.769" style="s2">seeing Trump&#39;s moderate solutions I</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.999" end="00:58:03.230" style="s2">don&#39;t know that to have happened I</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.769" end="00:58:05.029" style="s2">believe that would be a crazy thing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.230" end="00:58:07.759" style="s2">just flat-out assert and not be true</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.029" end="00:58:09.349" style="s2">yeah I just might know who is on the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.759" end="00:58:14.329" style="s2">list that&#39;ll tell us whether or not this</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.349" end="00:58:17.869" style="s2">is a serious effort or not I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.329" end="00:58:20.839" style="s2">I do ignore Trump&#39;s moderate instincts I</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.869" end="00:58:24.200" style="s2">think I spend a lot of time trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.839" end="00:58:27.019" style="s2">not fault him for things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.200" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">fault worthy right there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.019" end="00:58:31.369" style="s2">fault worthy that&#39;s the problem but I do</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:34.309" style="s2">not go into this with any assumption as</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.369" end="00:58:36.559" style="s2">those who are longtime Watchers will</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.309" end="00:58:38.180" style="s2">know I was rooting for him I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.559" end="00:58:39.529" style="s2">didn&#39;t vote for him but at the point</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.180" end="00:58:41.660" style="s2">that he was in office my feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.529" end="00:58:43.339" style="s2">whoever has been elected you should root</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.660" end="00:58:45.079" style="s2">for them to succeed and to make things</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.339" end="00:58:48.049" style="s2">better even if it makes you look foolish</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.079" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">we managed to have hope said you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.049" end="00:58:52.849" style="s2">what he&#39;s in it maybe the only maybe</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:55.190" style="s2">he&#39;ll pull off the course as it were you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.849" end="00:58:57.440" style="s2">know to be you know he was so political</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.190" end="00:58:59.390" style="s2">yeah that he could get in even though he</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.440" end="00:59:00.769" style="s2">was a complete outsider and now that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.390" end="00:59:02.450" style="s2">he&#39;s in maybe he can actually do the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.769" end="00:59:04.430" style="s2">reform that he talked about but there</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.450" end="00:59:07.549" style="s2">seems to have been precious little swamp</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.430" end="00:59:09.529" style="s2">draining yeah I thought he had he had</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.549" end="00:59:11.630" style="s2">room having accomplished what he did</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.529" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">which nobody else could of or almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.630" end="00:59:16.220" style="s2">nobody else could have he had room to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:17.720" style="s2">the greatest president in history he</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.220" end="00:59:18.680" style="s2">could have refunded the nation but it</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.720" end="00:59:20.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t over the first time you said</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.680" end="00:59:21.920" style="s2">that to me it&#39;s like are you kidding me</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.059" end="00:59:23.210" style="s2">but you know I&#39;m just saying if you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.920" end="00:59:25.999" style="s2">could have swapped in another person</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.210" end="00:59:27.859" style="s2">yeah right at that moment in his cards</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.999" end="00:59:29.809" style="s2">they could have refounded the knife he</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.859" end="00:59:33.079" style="s2">had marbles he didn&#39;t he created many of</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.809" end="00:59:35.089" style="s2">them yeah like you know more power to</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.079" end="00:59:36.440" style="s2">him that he did but then then what&#39;d he</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.089" end="00:59:37.730" style="s2">do with him but you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.440" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">trade-offs and the problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.730" end="00:59:41.509" style="s2">skills that were necessary to get</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:43.789" style="s2">through the gate are not consistent with</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.509" end="00:59:45.829" style="s2">the instincts that would cause you to go</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.789" end="00:59:47.900" style="s2">through that refounding process and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.829" end="00:59:48.859" style="s2">it he&#39;s too good at politics to put it</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.900" end="00:59:50.450" style="s2">aside I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.859" end="00:59:52.700" style="s2">basically what he is good at and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.450" end="00:59:55.029" style="s2">everything is political so my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.700" end="00:59:58.190" style="s2">even if he has brought people together</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.029" end="01:00:00.980" style="s2">he will not be able to resist using it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.190" end="01:00:01.700" style="s2">as a political weapon but please mr.</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.980" end="01:00:05.869" style="s2">president</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.700" end="01:00:07.210" style="s2">prove me wrong hmm yeah right let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.869" end="01:00:08.599" style="s2">two more</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.210" end="01:00:10.789" style="s2">previously you talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.599" end="01:00:13.220" style="s2">post-modernism versus Marxism and trying</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.789" end="01:00:15.349" style="s2">to explain identitarian ISM aren&#39;t Gramm</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.220" end="01:00:16.910" style="s2">she they can prancing that correctly and</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.349" end="01:00:18.680" style="s2">the Frankfurt School the connecting</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.910" end="01:00:20.059" style="s2">point using critical theory and to</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.680" end="01:00:22.640" style="s2">undermine bourgeois values and so on</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.059" end="01:00:26.140" style="s2">yeah and so we&#39;ve actually gotten some</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.640" end="01:00:28.910" style="s2">private communications objecting to our</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.140" end="01:00:30.980" style="s2">dismissing critical theory and and</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.910" end="01:00:33.079" style="s2">specifically Mark Hughes which we talked</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.980" end="01:00:35.450" style="s2">about in one of the most recent ones in</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.079" end="01:00:36.529" style="s2">answering a question but yes the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.450" end="01:00:39.890" style="s2">Frankfurt School seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.529" end="01:00:43.339" style="s2">foundational and the connecting point</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.890" end="01:00:45.109" style="s2">and while both of us have been up to</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.339" end="01:00:46.700" style="s2">speed on all the intricacies here I</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.109" end="01:00:48.950" style="s2">certainly am NOT at the moment and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.700" end="01:00:50.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know that you are at the moment to</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.950" end="01:00:52.940" style="s2">speak to all the different ways the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.900" end="01:00:54.739" style="s2">connections do and do not track to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.940" end="01:00:56.420" style="s2">current moment I am absolutely up to</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.739" end="01:00:58.369" style="s2">speed on all of the connections and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.420" end="01:01:01.549" style="s2">would like to diagram them for you now</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.369" end="01:01:04.819" style="s2">okay no let me say this I actually think</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.549" end="01:01:07.150" style="s2">this is a mistake which trying to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.819" end="01:01:10.190" style="s2">what the questioner is asking us to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.150" end="01:01:13.220" style="s2">here&#39;s my point this is this is your</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.190" end="01:01:15.019" style="s2">magic right here well no no no in a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.220" end="01:01:18.859" style="s2">way like this is this is the Gordian</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.019" end="01:01:21.470" style="s2">knot stuff that you do so well we are in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.859" end="01:01:23.480" style="s2">a phase in which all sorts of people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.470" end="01:01:27.349" style="s2">have some sort of a dog in the fight</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.480" end="01:01:29.930" style="s2">somewhere on the level of theory right</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.349" end="01:01:31.970" style="s2">you&#39;ve got anarchists who are freaking</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.930" end="01:01:34.609" style="s2">out that they are being synonymous with</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.970" end="01:01:36.890" style="s2">an teefin though an Tifa if you look</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.609" end="01:01:40.099" style="s2">closely is basically an anarchist</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.890" end="01:01:42.980" style="s2">organization and says so so what I would</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.099" end="01:01:44.359" style="s2">say is do not mind the details they</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.980" end="01:01:46.519" style="s2">don&#39;t matter this isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.359" end="01:01:50.599" style="s2">exactly any of these things does this</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.519" end="01:01:53.930" style="s2">movement loosely match the archetype of</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.599" end="01:01:57.200" style="s2">an anarchist movement it does own it</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.930" end="01:01:59.900" style="s2">that&#39;s what it is right is this a</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.200" end="01:02:01.099" style="s2">question of the Frankfurt School sorta</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.900" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">but most of the people in the street</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.099" end="01:02:06.410" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know what the Frankfurt School</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:09.559" style="s2">is and you know is this more like you</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.410" end="01:02:11.900" style="s2">know the cultural revolution than it is</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.559" end="01:02:13.609" style="s2">like the Bolshevik Revolution well so</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.900" end="01:02:14.299" style="s2">far does it have elements of the French</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.609" end="01:02:16.280" style="s2">Revolution</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.299" end="01:02:18.049" style="s2">it does is it going to be like any of</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.280" end="01:02:21.349" style="s2">these things no you already know that</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.049" end="01:02:23.059" style="s2">right it&#39;s gonna be new so the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.349" end="01:02:24.829" style="s2">really the question I was actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.059" end="01:02:27.849" style="s2">trying to convince my parents was the</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.829" end="01:02:31.970" style="s2">right question when I saw them in LA was</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.849" end="01:02:35.960" style="s2">is what&#39;s going on now is it going to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.970" end="01:02:38.930" style="s2">on the same list as the Bolshevik</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.960" end="01:02:42.680" style="s2">Revolution the Cultural Revolution the</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.930" end="01:02:46.040" style="s2">French Revolution Cambodia Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.680" end="01:02:48.410" style="s2">Germany&#39;s gonna be on that list if so</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.040" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">that&#39;s all you need to know you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.410" end="01:02:53.270" style="s2">what that force is and the question is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:55.760" style="s2">do you have some way to deal with it or</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.270" end="01:02:58.549" style="s2">is getting out of its way the most you</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.760" end="01:03:00.410" style="s2">can hope for right if it&#39;s if it belongs</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.549" end="01:03:02.059" style="s2">on that list that&#39;s good enough you</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.410" end="01:03:03.770" style="s2">don&#39;t need to parse the details anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.059" end="01:03:06.500" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna drive yourself crazy and</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.770" end="01:03:09.020" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna waste effort that is at</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.500" end="01:03:11.930" style="s2">this moment it&#39;s so precious so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.020" end="01:03:15.170" style="s2">bother just accept that these things are</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.930" end="01:03:16.339" style="s2">loosely enough right there they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.170" end="01:03:18.200" style="s2">have to be precise they have to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.339" end="01:03:19.670" style="s2">accurate and if they are accurate we</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.200" end="01:03:23.930" style="s2">know enough about what comes next that</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.670" end="01:03:25.000" style="s2">we should go there yeah you did it all</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.930" end="01:03:28.700" style="s2">right excellent</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.000" end="01:03:32.510" style="s2">last question the current left seems to</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.700" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">be a product of the 1960s how I left how</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.510" end="01:03:35.990" style="s2">I left which intended to liberate</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:37.819" style="s2">customs and ideas from a restrictive</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.990" end="01:03:40.490" style="s2">Society became restrictive in its own</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.819" end="01:03:43.880" style="s2">towards politically incorrect ideas did</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.490" end="01:03:45.799" style="s2">it become part of the establishment yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.880" end="01:03:47.270" style="s2">actually it did it did in part become</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.799" end="01:03:48.890" style="s2">part of the establishment and this is I</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.270" end="01:03:50.900" style="s2">mean this is a point that that we&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.900" end="01:03:57.880" style="s2">Evergreen blew up really that in part</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.460" end="01:04:00.500" style="s2">liberals should be celebrating and</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.880" end="01:04:03.859" style="s2">recognized for the fact that many of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.500" end="01:04:06.980" style="s2">things that they before our time but you</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.859" end="01:04:08.630" style="s2">know we were fighting for with regard to</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.980" end="01:04:11.210" style="s2">actual civil rights</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.630" end="01:04:13.670" style="s2">and you know second wave feminism not</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.210" end="01:04:18.020" style="s2">the later waves but you know and and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.670" end="01:04:20.290" style="s2">know just equality of opportunity for</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.020" end="01:04:23.000" style="s2">people regardless of demographics and</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.290" end="01:04:25.070" style="s2">you know and things like restricted</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.000" end="01:04:30.460" style="s2">working hours and child labor laws like</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.070" end="01:04:34.790" style="s2">all of these are actually wins for</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.460" end="01:04:37.490" style="s2">liberals who became the establishment to</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.790" end="01:04:39.470" style="s2">some degree they became the</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.490" end="01:04:43.370" style="s2">establishment becoming the establishment</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.470" end="01:04:45.620" style="s2">makes you conservative unless you have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.370" end="01:04:47.420" style="s2">very great strength of character and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.620" end="01:04:48.950" style="s2">don&#39;t mean that conservatives don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.420" end="01:04:50.750" style="s2">strength of character but what I mean is</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.950" end="01:04:52.490" style="s2">that when you have a lot to lose your</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.750" end="01:04:55.070" style="s2">tendency to want to conserve the things</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.490" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">that got it for you is so high that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.070" end="01:05:01.130" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily update when you should</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:03.350" style="s2">so that process has as I think I did a</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.130" end="01:05:05.500" style="s2">pretty good job on Joe Rogan&#39;s program</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.350" end="01:05:09.110" style="s2">of explaining that process is frozen</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.500" end="01:05:10.790" style="s2">normal regular folks out of a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.110" end="01:05:11.930" style="s2">well-being that society generates and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.790" end="01:05:13.220" style="s2">they&#39;re pissed and that&#39;s why they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.930" end="01:05:14.630" style="s2">the street and they&#39;re not wrong</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.220" end="01:05:16.460" style="s2">it is rigged against them and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.630" end="01:05:17.720" style="s2">evenly rigged it&#39;s rigged against some</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.460" end="01:05:20.390" style="s2">populations more than others which</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.720" end="01:05:24.350" style="s2">explains the sort of fusion of occupy</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.390" end="01:05:29.800" style="s2">with black lives matter but the point</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.350" end="01:05:34.220" style="s2">also though and the point also is</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.800" end="01:05:36.710" style="s2">intersectionality is a new solution to</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.220" end="01:05:40.220" style="s2">an old problem and unfortunately the old</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.710" end="01:05:43.040" style="s2">problem is when you don&#39;t have growth to</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.220" end="01:05:45.260" style="s2">offer people who are demanding growth</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.040" end="01:05:47.240" style="s2">when growth makes us feel good because</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.260" end="01:05:48.620" style="s2">things are getting better alright and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.240" end="01:05:50.480" style="s2">you don&#39;t have any growth to offer them</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.620" end="01:05:51.980" style="s2">you figure out how you can get some</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.480" end="01:05:53.600" style="s2">phony growth and you can get phony</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.980" end="01:05:54.830" style="s2">growth in a number of ways you can steal</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.600" end="01:05:56.360" style="s2">it from the future and make the future</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.830" end="01:05:58.250" style="s2">worse in order to make the present feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.360" end="01:06:00.350" style="s2">better or you can steal it from people</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.250" end="01:06:03.080" style="s2">who can&#39;t defend themselves so we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.350" end="01:06:06.530" style="s2">a demographic problem in which corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.080" end="01:06:08.780" style="s2">elites in both parties are not sharing</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.530" end="01:06:10.640" style="s2">well-being that they have earned through</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.780" end="01:06:13.000" style="s2">what Tim Rupp would call money on money</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.640" end="01:06:16.250" style="s2">returns what I would say rent-seeking</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.000" end="01:06:17.990" style="s2">but those people are not ready to share</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.250" end="01:06:20.060" style="s2">and instead of sharing what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.990" end="01:06:21.770" style="s2">decided to do is take people who are</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.060" end="01:06:22.370" style="s2">aggrieved and point them at people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.770" end="01:06:24.350" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.370" end="01:06:26.480" style="s2">themselves it&#39;s not that different from</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.350" end="01:06:28.940" style="s2">what happened in Weimar Germany blaming</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.480" end="01:06:30.710" style="s2">the Jews justified stealing stuff from</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.940" end="01:06:33.350" style="s2">them and giving it to other people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.710" end="01:06:34.790" style="s2">wanted growth and the German apparatus</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.350" end="01:06:37.010" style="s2">couldn&#39;t provide it right so this is an</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.790" end="01:06:38.900" style="s2">old trick now in this case the</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.010" end="01:06:40.730" style="s2">intersectional version is new the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.900" end="01:06:41.570" style="s2">intersectional version says you can take</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.730" end="01:06:43.460" style="s2">it from white people because they</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.570" end="01:06:45.740" style="s2">deserve it that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.460" end="01:06:47.810" style="s2">and the point is that&#39;s cheaper than</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.740" end="01:06:49.160" style="s2">sharing I know my sister-in-law makes a</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.810" end="01:06:50.420" style="s2">point like this I&#39;ve been making that</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.160" end="01:06:52.910" style="s2">point for a very long time</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.420" end="01:06:55.010" style="s2">that instead of sharing what has been</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.910" end="01:06:56.450" style="s2">hoarded you can point people at other</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.010" end="01:06:59.990" style="s2">people they&#39;re now allowed to steal from</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.450" end="01:07:02.810" style="s2">and you know I mean you can just take</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.990" end="01:07:04.310" style="s2">that sentence and map it onto all of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.810" end="01:07:06.290" style="s2">things that we are now told are</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.310" end="01:07:08.390" style="s2">desirable why would you get get rid of</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.290" end="01:07:09.710" style="s2">the police well certainly going to allow</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.390" end="01:07:11.600" style="s2">you to steal from people you&#39;ve now been</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.710" end="01:07:12.890" style="s2">told you&#39;re entitled to steal from right</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.600" end="01:07:15.470" style="s2">it&#39;s not that complicated</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.890" end="01:07:19.490" style="s2">so is that the revolution you want sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.470" end="01:07:22.880" style="s2">as hell ain&#39;t the one I want and we&#39;re</p>
