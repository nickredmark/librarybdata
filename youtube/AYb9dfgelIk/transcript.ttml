<p begin="00:00:44.900" end="00:00:50.420" style="s2">slide it&#39;s basically one hour we just</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.140" end="00:00:52.430" style="s2">come to a zoom room write our writing</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.420" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">intentions in the chat and then write</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.430" end="00:00:55.640" style="s2">for an hour together and that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:57.519" style="s2">going really great this week I think we</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.640" end="00:01:01.489" style="s2">had around six or seven people on a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.519" end="00:01:04.430" style="s2">daily basis this week another thing is</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.489" end="00:01:05.810" style="s2">there&#39;s a metagame slack channel and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.430" end="00:01:07.970" style="s2">you haven&#39;t joined that already I highly</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.810" end="00:01:10.040" style="s2">recommend you do and I&#39;ll also drop that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.970" end="00:01:13.310" style="s2">link in the chat but I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.040" end="00:01:15.439" style="s2">quickly get into tonight&#39;s theme which</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.310" end="00:01:18.439" style="s2">is this concept of hard versus soft</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.439" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">discipline and I think this is an</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.439" end="00:01:23.240" style="s2">important idea that will really help to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:24.230" style="s2">keep at the back of your mind whenever</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.240" end="00:01:26.620" style="s2">you&#39;re doing any kind of accountability</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.230" end="00:01:32.330" style="s2">with anybody in the in the coming weeks</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.620" end="00:01:34.010" style="s2">so first it helps to understand what we</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.330" end="00:01:36.760" style="s2">really mean by self-discipline to begin</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.010" end="00:01:39.440" style="s2">with and it&#39;s really this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.760" end="00:01:41.570" style="s2">aligning yourself with what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.440" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">do so that to pursue what you think is</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.570" end="00:01:46.760" style="s2">right despite the temptations to abandon</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:49.870" style="s2">that and it goes to the root word of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.760" end="00:01:51.950" style="s2">this year which means to learn and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.870" end="00:01:53.720" style="s2">deceptively na which means instruction</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.950" end="00:01:57.530" style="s2">and training so self discipline in a way</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.720" end="00:02:00.380" style="s2">is like self teaching self learning to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.530" end="00:02:02.600" style="s2">do what you think is right and you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.380" end="00:02:03.890" style="s2">tell this is quite similar to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.600" end="00:02:08.090" style="s2">of sovereignty with tweeting</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.890" end="00:02:10.489" style="s2">initially open with but I want to add a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.090" end="00:02:12.890" style="s2">couple flavors to it and these are just</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.489" end="00:02:14.750" style="s2">I guess like my words for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.890" end="00:02:15.799" style="s2">and there isn&#39;t any scientific basis to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:18.319" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying but I think these are</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.799" end="00:02:20.180" style="s2">useful concepts in my experience there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.319" end="00:02:21.680" style="s2">two types of discipline and one of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.180" end="00:02:23.989" style="s2">is hard discipline which is what most</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:26.209" style="s2">people think of when they think of self</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.989" end="00:02:27.799" style="s2">discipline which is when you reach this</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.209" end="00:02:28.970" style="s2">alignment of your actions with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.799" end="00:02:32.450" style="s2">better judgment through</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.970" end="00:02:33.260" style="s2">willpower effort or social pressure so</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.450" end="00:02:35.570" style="s2">you can think of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.260" end="00:02:38.030" style="s2">accountability groups doing a version of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.570" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">this you can think of whenever you try</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.030" end="00:02:41.750" style="s2">to get yourself to do something that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:43.310" style="s2">hard like wake up in the morning you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.750" end="00:02:44.750" style="s2">using heart discipline and for most</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.310" end="00:02:49.340" style="s2">people this is where the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.750" end="00:02:50.810" style="s2">discipline starts and ends I want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.340" end="00:02:53.150" style="s2">propose to you that there&#39;s another idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.810" end="00:02:54.560" style="s2">which we&#39;ll call soft discipline which</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.150" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">is when you&#39;re aligning your actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.560" end="00:02:59.480" style="s2">with your better judgment through better</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:01.370" style="s2">understanding now this is obviously a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.480" end="00:03:04.610" style="s2">little bit vague err so I think it helps</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.370" end="00:03:08.570" style="s2">to think of an example let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.610" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">trying to quit smoking you can throw</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.570" end="00:03:13.610" style="s2">away all your cigarettes you can try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">practice willpower for a 30-day period</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.610" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">you can get your friends to hold you</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:21.110" style="s2">accountable or I actually heard this one</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">example where somebody made some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.110" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">commitment contract where if they had</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.560" style="s2">another cigarette they would donate a</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:29.270" style="s2">few thousand dollars to the KKK or</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.560" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2">something like that some undesirable</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.270" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">outcome was related to the activity and</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">that would be a hard discipline approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:39.260" style="s2">but there&#39;s been many cases of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:41.150" style="s2">quitting smoking through a soft</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.260" end="00:03:42.290" style="s2">discipline approach where all of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.150" end="00:03:46.489" style="s2">sudden they have an epiphany that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.290" end="00:03:49.580" style="s2">bad for them and they stop maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.489" end="00:03:51.769" style="s2">somebody in their family got lung cancer</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.580" end="00:03:53.810" style="s2">maybe they had a some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.769" end="00:03:55.430" style="s2">psychedelic episode where they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.810" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">know eyes kind of opened up to how</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.430" end="00:03:59.900" style="s2">destructive this whole smoking thing is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:02.540" style="s2">in fact there&#39;s a study on this the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:05.000" style="s2">effective smoking cessation study was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.540" end="00:04:08.590" style="s2">study where they gave a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.000" end="00:04:13.209" style="s2">participants who were chronic smokers</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.590" end="00:04:16.580" style="s2">reasonably high dose of psilocybin and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.209" end="00:04:19.489" style="s2">at the end of the study over 80% of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.580" end="00:04:21.470" style="s2">had quit smoking in that one-time event</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.489" end="00:04:24.200" style="s2">and they followed up with them I think a</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.470" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">year after and it had still maintained a</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.200" end="00:04:30.470" style="s2">smoke-free life so clearly there are</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.020" end="00:04:32.300" style="s2">other ways let&#39;s say and I&#39;m gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.470" end="00:04:33.919" style="s2">soft discipline model to refer to those</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.300" end="00:04:35.780" style="s2">ways where you have an epiphany or some</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.919" end="00:04:37.340" style="s2">sort of change in understanding or your</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.780" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">felt sensor relationship with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.340" end="00:04:44.100" style="s2">difficult behavior changes</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:45.480" style="s2">this is related to this other concept</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.100" end="00:04:49.350" style="s2">that goes back to the Greeks called</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.480" end="00:04:50.640" style="s2">akrasia which is acting against your</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.350" end="00:04:54.360" style="s2">better judgment through weakness of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.640" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">will and for some this is a useful</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.360" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">concept the idea that there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">things that you want to do that are just</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:03.030" style="s2">hard to do and so you don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">will to actually do those things and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.030" end="00:05:07.350" style="s2">- to the extent that you don&#39;t do them</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:09.140" style="s2">you&#39;re a kradic but then some people say</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.350" end="00:05:12.210" style="s2">a creator doesn&#39;t actually exist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.140" end="00:05:14.220" style="s2">really what&#39;s happening is you just</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.210" end="00:05:17.250" style="s2">never wanted to do the thing to begin</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.220" end="00:05:18.450" style="s2">with you didn&#39;t really have the better</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.250" end="00:05:21.480" style="s2">judgment willpower</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.450" end="00:05:25.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t even factor into it so these</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:27.630" style="s2">questions may seem significant you may</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.860" end="00:05:29.580" style="s2">wonder what what type of discipline is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.630" end="00:05:31.950" style="s2">better in what situation does a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.580" end="00:05:33.450" style="s2">even exist and actually there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.950" end="00:05:35.670" style="s2">who have a lot of debates about this</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.450" end="00:05:37.860" style="s2">stuff and what I&#39;d say to all of this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.670" end="00:05:39.810" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t really matter because</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.860" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">we&#39;re playing the meta game here and</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.810" end="00:05:46.890" style="s2">we&#39;re evaluating the quality of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:48.540" style="s2">models based on their utility and we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.890" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">not maintaining any kind of commitment</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.540" end="00:05:54.210" style="s2">to any one approach we are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:05:56.190" style="s2">judge hard discipline we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.210" end="00:05:59.130" style="s2">judge soft discipline we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.190" end="00:06:01.470" style="s2">judge the concept of a Croatia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.130" end="00:06:07.590" style="s2">basically the goal is to operate from a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.470" end="00:06:09.750" style="s2">position of non-judgmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.590" end="00:06:11.370" style="s2">a non-judgmental perspective where</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.750" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">you&#39;re able to use wisdom to decide</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.370" end="00:06:14.850" style="s2">which of these models is most suitable</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:17.970" style="s2">for what you&#39;re trying to do in the</p>

<p begin="00:06:17.970" end="00:06:22.170" style="s2">because obviously this is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.410" end="00:06:24.090" style="s2">broader topic but as we continue to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.170" end="00:06:26.850" style="s2">various forms of accountability it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.090" end="00:06:28.380" style="s2">important to always step out of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.850" end="00:06:30.420" style="s2">frame you&#39;re in step out of even the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.380" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">accountability model and just take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.420" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">meta frame and look at what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:38.730" style="s2">the most useful for what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:41.340" style="s2">do so with that I want to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.730" end="00:06:45.840" style="s2">this stuff relates to cruise relates to</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.340" end="00:06:47.550" style="s2">masterminds traditionally accountability</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.840" end="00:06:49.560" style="s2">groups use hard discipline as we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.550" end="00:06:51.660" style="s2">described earlier and I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.560" end="00:06:53.820" style="s2">lot of stuff out there about this you</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.660" end="00:06:55.890" style="s2">know you create the commitment contracts</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.820" end="00:06:57.990" style="s2">the prototype that we presented last</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.890" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">week and that some of you have started</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.990" end="00:07:02.220" style="s2">to practice this week explicitly at</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:04.140" style="s2">least has more of a heart discipline</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.220" end="00:07:05.640" style="s2">approach where you have a bunch of your</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.140" end="00:07:08.070" style="s2">commitments being tracked and you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.640" end="00:07:09.840" style="s2">people that are checking in with you but</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:11.850" style="s2">what I want to introduce is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.840" end="00:07:13.560" style="s2">that good cruise the best cruise</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.850" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">actually helped with the soft discipline</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.560" end="00:07:19.800" style="s2">piece and there&#39;s at least two ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:21.690" style="s2">through which they do this one of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:23.850" style="s2">is the cruise themselves so these groups</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.690" end="00:07:25.950" style="s2">of three people in this case but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.850" end="00:07:28.980" style="s2">maybe up to eight people they start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.950" end="00:07:30.270" style="s2">develop implicit or explicit standards</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.980" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">and values like you can actually write</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.270" end="00:07:35.160" style="s2">down what your standards and values are</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:38.250" style="s2">and that those those values start to</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.160" end="00:07:41.250" style="s2">subtly shift the values of the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.250" end="00:07:43.140" style="s2">within that group so and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.250" end="00:07:47.340" style="s2">talk about how their studies that show</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.140" end="00:07:49.320" style="s2">that people are roughly as healthy as</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.340" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">the friends that they spend the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.320" end="00:07:53.640" style="s2">time with there&#39;s a famous self-help</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:54.810" style="s2">quote that your the average of the five</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.640" end="00:07:57.690" style="s2">people you spend the most time with</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.810" end="00:07:59.670" style="s2">these things happen through self</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.690" end="00:08:01.770" style="s2">discipline you&#39;re not looking at your</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.670" end="00:08:03.210" style="s2">friends and then trying to force</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.770" end="00:08:05.490" style="s2">yourself to be more like them that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.210" end="00:08:07.590" style="s2">happening it&#39;s more so that over the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.490" end="00:08:11.100" style="s2">long term the standards start to shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.590" end="00:08:12.870" style="s2">your behavior and then the other point</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.100" end="00:08:14.250" style="s2">which I think is a is really the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.870" end="00:08:17.220" style="s2">interesting one and the one that I want</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.250" end="00:08:18.930" style="s2">to highlight is that cruise can help by</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.220" end="00:08:21.270" style="s2">shining the light of truth on everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.930" end="00:08:23.700" style="s2">blind spots so if we go back to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.270" end="00:08:25.140" style="s2">that soft discipline is about getting a</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.700" end="00:08:27.990" style="s2">better understanding of a situation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.140" end="00:08:30.810" style="s2">take the smoking case you you actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.990" end="00:08:33.390" style="s2">understand the full experience of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.810" end="00:08:35.310" style="s2">it means to be a smoker right when you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.390" end="00:08:37.020" style="s2">when you develop that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.310" end="00:08:39.330" style="s2">understanding of how it affects you how</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.020" end="00:08:41.160" style="s2">how it&#39;s affecting your lungs and all</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.330" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">that information becomes more available</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.160" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">to you you&#39;re bringing the truth about</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">the situation to a higher level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:51.770" style="s2">salience and that&#39;s what&#39;s making it</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:54.300" style="s2">easier to overcome the smoking habit and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.770" end="00:08:56.370" style="s2">my hypothesis with those psilocybin</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.300" end="00:08:57.690" style="s2">studies is that&#39;s what psilocybin does</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.370" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">it kind of changes the salience</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.690" end="00:09:02.850" style="s2">landscape and all of a sudden smoking</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:05.360" style="s2">means something else now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.850" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">suggesting everybody have these you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.360" end="00:09:09.660" style="s2">epiphanies moments or takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:12.450" style="s2">dellux but what I am saying is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.660" end="00:09:14.790" style="s2">crews can do that exact same thing over</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.450" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">the long term as long as everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.790" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">crew has a commitment to telling the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:22.760" style="s2">truth to one another and to shining</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">light on everybody else&#39;s blind spots so</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.760" end="00:09:27.290" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much it that&#39;s the main</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:31.650" style="s2">takeaway from this and I&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.290" end="00:09:34.800" style="s2">so that we can have some discussion and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.650" end="00:09:37.380" style="s2">to begin I just like to hear openly from</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.800" end="00:09:39.900" style="s2">everybody what does everybody think</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.380" end="00:09:42.420" style="s2">about that what does this idea seem</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.900" end="00:09:43.860" style="s2">useful do you have examples of hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.420" end="00:09:46.050" style="s2">discipline and soft discipline in your</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.860" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">own lives I just love to hear from</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.050" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">anyone</p>
