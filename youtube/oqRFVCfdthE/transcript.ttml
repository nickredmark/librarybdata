<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:11.309" style="s2">day 1 of me talking about myself instead</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:16.220" style="s2">of my project so today I wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.309" end="00:00:21.090" style="s2">about external versus internal just</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.220" end="00:00:22.529" style="s2">external like living my life trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.090" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">be better trying to be this version</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.529" end="00:00:28.050" style="s2">trying to be more feminine trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:32.700" style="s2">a woman trying to be an amazing parent</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.050" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">trying to be all of these things and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:37.920" style="s2">difference when realizing the shift of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">doing it from an external force of like</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">what society says a woman is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:51.570" style="s2">society says a good parent is versus Who</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.570" end="00:00:55.590" style="s2">subtle shift it&#39;s actually really not a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.920" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">subtle shift it&#39;s pretty extreme shift</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.590" end="00:01:00.750" style="s2">but switching it so that it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:03.300" style="s2">looking good for the exterior world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.750" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">not about looking good for to find a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.300" end="00:01:06.689" style="s2">mate to get a job to do all these things</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">that are external it&#39;s about what makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.689" end="00:01:11.430" style="s2">me feel good what makes me feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">beautiful what makes me feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.430" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">being my most true authentic self and</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:17.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad kind of suggestion I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">still figuring that out I&#39;m still think</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.700" end="00:01:23.150" style="s2">of you know what clothes make me feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:25.470" style="s2">good and at the same time totally</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.150" end="00:01:27.150" style="s2">getting that I actually don&#39;t care and</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.470" end="00:01:31.890" style="s2">authentically I don&#39;t care what I look</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.150" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">like on 90% most everyday basis I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.890" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">care it&#39;s not worth it for me to put in</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:41.630" style="s2">the hours a day the door okay it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:44.369" style="s2">hours a day but hours a week for sure to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.630" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">do what I think society says looks good</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.369" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">I ain&#39;t got time for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:52.079" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got the energy for it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:55.560" style="s2">not where I want to be but realizing</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.079" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">that this fu to the world of like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.560" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">not gonna look good I&#39;m just gonna wear</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:01.229" style="s2">it&#39;s also it&#39;s the same as like trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">to look good for them try not to look</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.229" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">good for them and so instead sitting</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:11.959" style="s2">with myself being quiet and listening to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:18.019" style="s2">okay well what what do I actually want</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.959" end="00:02:19.939" style="s2">and what is my true authentic self what</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.019" end="00:02:22.459" style="s2">does she is she</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.939" end="00:02:27.560" style="s2">what does she wear what does she like to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.459" end="00:02:31.700" style="s2">do and a big one for me was my</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.560" end="00:02:37.010" style="s2">femaleness my femininity my lack of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.700" end="00:02:42.489" style="s2">femininity and realizing that I do in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.010" end="00:02:42.489" style="s2">fact like women and non-binary people</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.819" end="00:02:49.760" style="s2">what does that mean like what does it</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:52.159" style="s2">because when you are at least for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.760" end="00:02:54.530" style="s2">when I was heterosexual and there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.159" end="00:02:56.719" style="s2">like idea of what a woman is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:02:58.519" style="s2">of what a man is and they match up like</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.719" end="00:02:59.689" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay so he should be masculine</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.519" end="00:03:02.299" style="s2">he should be taller you should be</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.689" end="00:03:03.650" style="s2">stronger he should it&#39;s not generally</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.299" end="00:03:06.230" style="s2">they&#39;re not smarter than me but like</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.650" end="00:03:07.549" style="s2">that that&#39;s what society says that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.230" end="00:03:12.349" style="s2">you know should be a little older a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.549" end="00:03:13.609" style="s2">little and so then when then I know what</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.349" end="00:03:15.230" style="s2">I am because I&#39;m the reverse of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.609" end="00:03:16.790" style="s2">right that I should be a little shorter</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.230" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">that I should I was never gonna dumb</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.790" end="00:03:20.199" style="s2">myself down so being less intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:23.030" style="s2">was never a thing but like I should be</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.199" end="00:03:24.590" style="s2">more pretty I should spend more time</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.030" end="00:03:26.389" style="s2">getting ready than they do I should</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.590" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">spend and then all of a sudden when you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.389" end="00:03:30.109" style="s2">like people of your same gender or</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:33.250" style="s2">gender that you didn&#39;t even really know</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.109" end="00:03:36.590" style="s2">existed if you go it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.250" end="00:03:37.970" style="s2">feeling like it&#39;s wait am I supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.590" end="00:03:41.479" style="s2">be shorter do I date people that are</p>

<p begin="00:03:48.349" end="00:03:52.759" style="s2">trying to conform to this idea of what a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.449" end="00:03:56.629" style="s2">woman is in order to get a man and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.759" end="00:04:01.699" style="s2">kind of sucked at that and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.629" end="00:04:04.040" style="s2">what I who I truly am it&#39;s still it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.699" end="00:04:06.139" style="s2">ongoing journey and figuring out what it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.040" end="00:04:09.079" style="s2">means I mean a lot of I&#39;ll do another</p>

<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:20.570" style="s2">authentic self and what&#39;s gonna make me</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.109" end="00:04:21.950" style="s2">feel beautiful what am i interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.570" end="00:04:24.139" style="s2">because I think a lot of interests are</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.950" end="00:04:26.900" style="s2">like oh that&#39;s not cool or I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.139" end="00:04:28.370" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a geek for a large period of</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.900" end="00:04:30.590" style="s2">time so cool maybe it wasn&#39;t what I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.370" end="00:04:32.930" style="s2">trying to do but cool in a geek world</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.590" end="00:04:34.639" style="s2">right that maybe then it&#39;s not okay to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.930" end="00:04:36.529" style="s2">like sports because then you&#39;re your age</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.639" end="00:04:39.650" style="s2">and I don&#39;t like sports I authentically</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.650" end="00:04:43.580" style="s2">kind of supposed to fake it and I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.029" end="00:04:45.080" style="s2">women who legitimately love sports they</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.580" end="00:04:47.150" style="s2">are some of the biggest sports fans that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.080" end="00:04:49.099" style="s2">I know and then I know other women who</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.150" end="00:04:51.169" style="s2">are like yeah like I&#39;ll watch a hockey</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.169" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">beginning in the in the honeymoon stage</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.909" end="00:04:55.810" style="s2">they like sports and later on they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:58.189" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t think they liked</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.810" end="00:04:59.659" style="s2">consciously or doing that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.189" end="00:05:00.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a sub and I know there&#39;s areas</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.659" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">where I was like that like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.860" end="00:05:04.430" style="s2">subconscious like oh well they won&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.900" end="00:05:14.599" style="s2">top 40 music because that&#39;s not so cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.259" end="00:05:17.210" style="s2">and just realizing all the ways that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.599" end="00:05:19.729" style="s2">was allowing this external world to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.210" end="00:05:21.500" style="s2">dictate what I should like who I should</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.729" end="00:05:24.979" style="s2">be who I should like what they should</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.500" end="00:05:26.509" style="s2">like and letting that all fall away and</p>
