<p begin="00:01:03.989" end="00:01:07.590" style="s2">ger in the main interview getting pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.729" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">geeky but also covering some really</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.590" end="00:01:10.740" style="s2">really interesting topics it&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:12.750" style="s2">those big-picture conversations that</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.740" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">points out both the horrible ways in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.750" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">which society seems to be running his</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">health off of a cliff and also the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:19.350" style="s2">awesome opportunities that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:20.490" style="s2">radically improve things I had a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.350" end="00:01:22.530" style="s2">time with this conversation really</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.490" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">appreciated Daniel&#39;s ability to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.530" end="00:01:25.560" style="s2">shine a light on both the opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">and the pitfalls that we&#39;ve got in front</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.560" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">of us so a good interview coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:30.600" style="s2">somewhat of a longer episode this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">if you&#39;re exhausted by the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.600" end="00:01:33.119" style="s2">interview and just need to get some</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:34.860" style="s2">sleep hang around until the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.119" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">episode I&#39;m gonna tell you what sleeping</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.860" end="00:01:38.189" style="s2">position actually proves to be best for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">your brain believe it or not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.189" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">position that you sleep in as well as</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.840" end="00:01:43.079" style="s2">just about everything else about sleep</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:44.610" style="s2">can make a quantitative difference in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.079" end="00:01:46.530" style="s2">your brain health this is true at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.610" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">if you are a rat but probably true for</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.530" end="00:01:49.229" style="s2">people as well that&#39;ll be in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">ruthless list and a retention gimmick</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.229" end="00:01:54.229" style="s2">but as usual let&#39;s kick things off first</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:56.689" style="s2">with this week in neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.229" end="00:01:58.909" style="s2">smart drug smarts this week in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.689" end="00:02:00.890" style="s2">neuroscience so it&#39;s always nice to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.909" end="00:02:02.329" style="s2">a smart drug smarts alumnus in the news</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.890" end="00:02:04.130" style="s2">and I wanted to get this one in there</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.329" end="00:02:05.869" style="s2">this is not actually a this week in</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:07.820" style="s2">neuroscience but a late last year in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.869" end="00:02:09.560" style="s2">neuroscience but the lead author of this</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.820" end="00:02:11.180" style="s2">paper that was recently published in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.560" end="00:02:13.340" style="s2">journal with a cool name brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.180" end="00:02:15.739" style="s2">stimulation was none other than dr.</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.340" end="00:02:17.150" style="s2">Martin Monty of UCLA who he spoke with</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.739" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">on a two-fer episode where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.150" end="00:02:21.290" style="s2">interviewed both him and dr. Kathleen</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.330" style="s2">Bell about traumatic brain injury this</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.290" end="00:02:24.769" style="s2">was probably 10 15 episodes ago at this</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.330" end="00:02:27.500" style="s2">point but right around that same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.769" end="00:02:29.540" style="s2">dr. Monty was also helping a 25 year old</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.500" end="00:02:30.530" style="s2">man who was in a coma recover and break</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.540" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">out of that coma through a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.530" end="00:02:35.540" style="s2">never-before-used technique called low</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:37.880" style="s2">intensity focused ultrasound pulsation</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.540" end="00:02:39.530" style="s2">which in layman&#39;s terms jump-started his</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.880" end="00:02:41.450" style="s2">brain out of the coma using sonic</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.530" end="00:02:43.430" style="s2">stimulation to excite neurons in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.450" end="00:02:45.019" style="s2">brains thalamus prior to last year the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.430" end="00:02:46.819" style="s2">closest thing that neurologists had been</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.019" end="00:02:49.220" style="s2">able to accomplish to this was using a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.819" end="00:02:51.620" style="s2">DBS deep brain stimulation which is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.220" end="00:02:52.880" style="s2">surgical procedure which is invasive but</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.620" end="00:02:55.010" style="s2">what Monte and his group did was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.880" end="00:02:56.599" style="s2">purely non-invasive technique using a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.010" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">device about the size of a coffee cup</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.599" end="00:03:00.799" style="s2">saucer which created a small sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:02.359" style="s2">acoustical energy that could be aimed at</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.799" end="00:03:03.889" style="s2">different regions of the brain to excite</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.359" end="00:03:05.870" style="s2">the brain tissue there in this case they</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.889" end="00:03:07.220" style="s2">targeted the thalamus which is a region</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.870" end="00:03:09.170" style="s2">in which the performance is typically</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.220" end="00:03:10.970" style="s2">vastly diminished in patients suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.170" end="00:03:12.859" style="s2">from coma the changes in the patient</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.970" end="00:03:14.329" style="s2">according to Monte were remarkable prior</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.859" end="00:03:15.829" style="s2">to the procedure the man showed only</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.329" end="00:03:17.690" style="s2">minimal signs of being conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.829" end="00:03:19.819" style="s2">understanding speech he could perform</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.690" end="00:03:21.319" style="s2">small limited movements but by three</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.819" end="00:03:22.880" style="s2">days after the procedure he&#39;d regained</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.319" end="00:03:24.680" style="s2">full consciousness and full language</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.880" end="00:03:26.329" style="s2">comprehension he could reliably respond</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.680" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">to doctors by nodding yes shaking his</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.329" end="00:03:29.630" style="s2">head no and he even made a fist bump</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:30.769" style="s2">gesture to say goodbye to one of his</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.630" end="00:03:32.510" style="s2">doctors who left the room</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.769" end="00:03:34.250" style="s2">according to dr. Monte the researchers</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.510" end="00:03:35.510" style="s2">expected a positive result with this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.250" end="00:03:37.160" style="s2">technique but he cautioned that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.510" end="00:03:38.720" style="s2">procedure requires further study on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.160" end="00:03:40.700" style="s2">additional patients before this could</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.720" end="00:03:42.410" style="s2">become a standard of care it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.700" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">he said that we were just very lucky and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.410" end="00:03:45.769" style="s2">happened to have stimulated the patient</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.569" style="s2">just as he was spontaneously recovering</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.769" end="00:03:49.130" style="s2">the device used emits only a small</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.569" end="00:03:50.900" style="s2">amount of energy and it worked just by</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.130" end="00:03:53.329" style="s2">turning it on in thirty-second blocks</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.900" end="00:03:55.130" style="s2">ten times over a 10-minute period so 30</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.329" end="00:03:56.750" style="s2">seconds on 30 seconds off for ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.130" end="00:03:58.549" style="s2">minutes that was enough to stimulate the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.750" end="00:03:59.959" style="s2">thalamus according to Monte if things</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.549" end="00:04:02.060" style="s2">work out this could eventually be built</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.959" end="00:04:03.319" style="s2">into a portable device such as a helmet</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.060" end="00:04:04.879" style="s2">that could be used to wake up coma</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.319" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">patients or other people in vegetative</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.910" end="00:09:55.540" style="s2">specifically reductionism taking a very</p>

<p begin="00:09:55.540" end="00:09:59.259" style="s2">finding a couple key variables bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.699" end="00:10:01.389" style="s2">it all down to those key variables was</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.160" end="00:10:06.459" style="s2">didn&#39;t need guesses in fact it was so</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.199" end="00:10:08.799" style="s2">much more effective in all those systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.459" end="00:10:10.119" style="s2">that it became the dominant system for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.799" end="00:10:11.799" style="s2">knowing how to do things and we started</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.119" end="00:10:13.629" style="s2">being able to get into systems that had</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.799" end="00:10:15.579" style="s2">more variables than just a couple but</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.629" end="00:10:17.829" style="s2">then as you start to encounter the</p>

<p begin="00:10:17.829" end="00:10:21.790" style="s2">you start to deal with complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.389" end="00:10:24.189" style="s2">where you have not just a slightly</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.189" end="00:10:28.299" style="s2">variables but you have nearly indefinite</p>

<p begin="00:10:31.420" end="00:10:35.589" style="s2">evolved in such a way that the variables</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.459" end="00:10:37.629" style="s2">it studied in isolation actually do</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.939" end="00:10:44.319" style="s2">context ends up defining the thing very</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:45.910" style="s2">profoundly then just looking at a small</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.319" end="00:10:46.089" style="s2">number of variables and then putting it</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.240" end="00:12:04.779" style="s2">everything that we hear from</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.350" end="00:12:07.149" style="s2">neuroscience is that the brain is still</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.779" end="00:12:09.189" style="s2">this really complicated partially</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.149" end="00:12:11.980" style="s2">unknown frontier and if there&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.189" end="00:12:14.740" style="s2">one area of science where we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.980" end="00:12:16.360" style="s2">enough of the fine minut specifics yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.740" end="00:12:18.790" style="s2">to be able to move away from</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.360" end="00:12:20.259" style="s2">reductionism the brain might be it would</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.790" end="00:12:21.459" style="s2">you disagree with that statement would</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.259" end="00:12:23.290" style="s2">you think that we&#39;re near some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.459" end="00:12:24.579" style="s2">swing point or tipping point what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.290" end="00:12:26.679" style="s2">general thoughts there I would say we</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.579" end="00:12:28.929" style="s2">need to frame up the topic differently</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.679" end="00:12:30.399" style="s2">so in reductionism our goal is to take a</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.929" end="00:12:32.259" style="s2">complex system and break it down into</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.399" end="00:12:33.730" style="s2">subsystems that are simpler and break</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.259" end="00:12:35.319" style="s2">those down into subsystems and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.730" end="00:12:38.040" style="s2">the direction of specialization so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.319" end="00:12:39.999" style="s2">take health and we look at neurology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.040" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">gastroenterology and oncology and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.999" end="00:12:43.449" style="s2">Rheumatology right we break the body</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:45.730" style="s2">into these kinds of anatomical tract</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.449" end="00:12:47.860" style="s2">systems try to understand those one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.730" end="00:12:49.509" style="s2">the problems ends up being here that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.860" end="00:12:51.550" style="s2">can have gut issues that a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.509" end="00:12:53.079" style="s2">gastroenterologist should be looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.550" end="00:12:55.569" style="s2">that are affecting brain issues we had</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.079" end="00:12:57.339" style="s2">got brain acts dynamics via microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.569" end="00:12:59.529" style="s2">the enteric nervous system right like so</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.339" end="00:13:01.749" style="s2">many different dynamics and so the cross</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.529" end="00:13:04.329" style="s2">system effects it&#39;s actually reason that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.749" end="00:13:05.949" style="s2">there&#39;s an assumption that whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.329" end="00:13:07.930" style="s2">effects are harder and further away</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.949" end="00:13:09.730" style="s2">epistemologically from here then</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.930" end="00:13:11.170" style="s2">reductionist answers and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.730" end="00:13:12.879" style="s2">saying the reductionist answers are</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.170" end="00:13:14.680" style="s2">infinitely far away because they can</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.879" end="00:13:16.300" style="s2">never solve these things ultimately will</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.680" end="00:13:17.769" style="s2">always be reductionist in it we will</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.300" end="00:13:19.509" style="s2">always be looking at a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.769" end="00:13:21.220" style="s2">everything that is involved yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.509" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">never going to know that every variable</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.220" end="00:13:24.699" style="s2">that&#39;s involved we have perfect</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:27.069" style="s2">confidence margins on so we&#39;re reducing</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.699" end="00:13:29.350" style="s2">the whole to some subset that the key is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.069" end="00:13:30.790" style="s2">that we seek to have that be not only a</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.350" end="00:13:32.499" style="s2">growing subset but that we understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.790" end="00:13:34.269" style="s2">the interconnectedness more obviously</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.499" end="00:13:35.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve been in Western health and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.269" end="00:13:37.029" style="s2">medicine and science in general trying</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.740" end="00:13:38.410" style="s2">to understand more and more variables</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.029" end="00:13:40.240" style="s2">understanding all the complex</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.240" end="00:13:44.079" style="s2">self organize complex not complicated</p>

<p begin="00:13:44.079" end="00:13:48.339" style="s2">of thinking to how it emerge that way is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.209" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">where we have a lot of room for growth</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.339" end="00:13:51.670" style="s2">right now that&#39;s the whole systems</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:53.350" style="s2">biology the movement so we move from</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.670" end="00:13:55.779" style="s2">these anatomical tracks to these</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.350" end="00:13:57.910" style="s2">similarly causal worlds looking at the</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.290" end="00:14:34.750" style="s2">seemed like very different areas of</p>

<p begin="00:14:34.750" end="00:14:38.620" style="s2">involved to have all of these parts</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.519" end="00:14:41.319" style="s2">interacting is I would say one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.620" end="00:14:43.300" style="s2">frontiers of the biological sciences</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.319" end="00:14:45.189" style="s2">right now your organization as the great</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.300" end="00:14:46.809" style="s2">name you got neuro hacker comm but it is</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.189" end="00:14:48.579" style="s2">named the neuro hacker collective why</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.809" end="00:14:50.470" style="s2">did you choose the neuro well I draw</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.110" end="00:14:57.639" style="s2">of a think tank that was working on</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.939" end="00:14:59.199" style="s2">complex system problem solving for all</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.639" end="00:15:00.939" style="s2">of the major complex systems at a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.199" end="00:15:03.399" style="s2">civilization level so we&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.939" end="00:15:04.990" style="s2">future of economics where the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.399" end="00:15:06.670" style="s2">of all agents is aligned with the</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.670" end="00:15:10.029" style="s2">we&#39;re working on governance to better</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.439" end="00:15:11.259" style="s2">systems of decision-making and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.029" end="00:15:13.360" style="s2">working on infrastructure to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.259" end="00:15:15.430" style="s2">closed-loop infrastructure where there</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.709" style="s2">no waste or need for ongoing and</p>

<p begin="00:15:17.709" end="00:15:22.420" style="s2">and we&#39;re working on how do we make sure</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.930" end="00:15:24.459" style="s2">that we have models that are really</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.420" end="00:15:26.680" style="s2">adequate for where Humanity is going and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.459" end="00:15:28.029" style="s2">once it was time to start building some</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.680" end="00:15:29.740" style="s2">of these we&#39;ve done work in a number of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.029" end="00:15:32.019" style="s2">the areas the reason why we decided to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.740" end="00:15:34.269" style="s2">invest a lot in the psychoneurosis pace</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.019" end="00:15:35.800" style="s2">early and we&#39;re still working on all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.269" end="00:15:37.180" style="s2">those spaces and connectedly why the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.800" end="00:15:39.820" style="s2">psychoneurosis pace so important is</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.180" end="00:15:41.050" style="s2">couple reasons one is all the problems</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.820" end="00:15:42.310" style="s2">that we see in the world that we would</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.050" end="00:15:44.170" style="s2">want to change whether we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.310" end="00:15:47.110" style="s2">about overfishing of the oceans or</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.170" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">biodiversity loss or war or crazy</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.110" end="00:15:51.190" style="s2">fundamentalism or crime or anything all</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:53.200" style="s2">these problems are being caused by human</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.190" end="00:15:55.420" style="s2">activity and human activity is being</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.200" end="00:15:57.399" style="s2">predisposed by lots of things economics</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.420" end="00:15:58.899" style="s2">for predisposing in but physiology is</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.399" end="00:16:00.279" style="s2">part of what&#39;s predisposing it everyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.899" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">knows that when their hormones are</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.279" end="00:16:03.430" style="s2">really not placed a neuro transmitters</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:05.560" style="s2">are out of place that not only do they</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.430" end="00:16:07.149" style="s2">feel shittier but they&#39;re likely to act</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.560" end="00:16:09.310" style="s2">differently and different and</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.149" end="00:16:10.930" style="s2">potentially let good ways well that ends</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.310" end="00:16:13.240" style="s2">up going all the way to the level of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.930" end="00:16:14.890" style="s2">psychopathy empathise mediated over</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.240" end="00:16:16.420" style="s2">certain neural networks and it can be up</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.890" end="00:16:18.459" style="s2">or down regulated complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.420" end="00:16:20.440" style="s2">problem-solving is mediated over certain</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.459" end="00:16:22.570" style="s2">neural networks and can be more or less</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.440" end="00:16:24.220" style="s2">capable so the hardware that human</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.570" end="00:16:26.260" style="s2">consciousness and decision-making runs</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.220" end="00:16:28.120" style="s2">on is a big deal yeah and so not only</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.260" end="00:16:30.250" style="s2">are all the problems predisposed by</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.120" end="00:16:31.750" style="s2">human action but all the solutions are</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.250" end="00:16:34.690" style="s2">gonna have to come through human action</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.750" end="00:16:36.699" style="s2">and so how do we elevate the collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.690" end="00:16:39.459" style="s2">intelligence and the collective</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.699" end="00:16:41.680" style="s2">experience and positive predisposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.459" end="00:16:44.290" style="s2">of humanity is a bandwidth limiting</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:46.779" style="s2">factor for all critical things and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.290" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">working at this level of helping to up</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.779" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">regulate human experience and human</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:52.060" style="s2">capability ends up being a very highly</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:53.709" style="s2">leveraged</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.060" end="00:16:55.540" style="s2">thing to do for everything else because</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.709" end="00:16:57.100" style="s2">then as you take people who want to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.540" end="00:16:58.750" style="s2">positive things and empower them and a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.100" end="00:17:00.459" style="s2">hardware level more positive things get</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.750" end="00:17:02.230" style="s2">to happen in a distributed decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.459" end="00:17:03.850" style="s2">way the other reason we want to work on</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.230" end="00:17:05.380" style="s2">is because it&#39;s very complex and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.850" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">more complex it is the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.380" end="00:17:08.919" style="s2">you succeed there means that those same</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:10.689" style="s2">tools can be repurposed to other things</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.919" end="00:17:12.309" style="s2">what is a specific problem that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.689" end="00:17:14.980" style="s2">would like to solve that you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.309" end="00:17:17.589" style="s2">to solve now we are working on psycho</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.980" end="00:17:19.390" style="s2">neuro topics and what we can share</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.589" end="00:17:21.419" style="s2">publicly is things where we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.390" end="00:17:23.650" style="s2">able to offer direct to people</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.419" end="00:17:24.850" style="s2">enhancement technologies medical</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.650" end="00:17:26.680" style="s2">technologies obviously have to go</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.850" end="00:17:28.480" style="s2">through a whole legal process</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.680" end="00:17:29.830" style="s2">for what it means to clear those medical</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.480" end="00:17:31.840" style="s2">technologies but we&#39;re working on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.830" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">research have it deeply and so when</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.840" end="00:17:34.600" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about psycho neuro we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.130" end="00:17:36.460" style="s2">talking about neurodegenerative things</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.600" end="00:17:38.410" style="s2">and kind of psychiatric things where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.460" end="00:17:40.600" style="s2">have to deal with not only the brain in</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:42.820" style="s2">the nervous system which is more complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.600" end="00:17:44.260" style="s2">in terms of orders of magnitude of total</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.820" end="00:17:46.060" style="s2">interactions happening than any other</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.260" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">body system we also have doable rest of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.060" end="00:17:49.120" style="s2">the body system in which its embedded</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:50.950" style="s2">and you have to deal with the interface</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.120" end="00:17:52.810" style="s2">with the psyche we have to Cle harder</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.950" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">kind of science because science doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.810" end="00:17:56.710" style="s2">deal with psyches well there&#39;s a deal</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:58.510" style="s2">with subjective stuff so it will only</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.710" end="00:18:00.040" style="s2">deal with the objective correlates of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.510" end="00:18:02.350" style="s2">the subjective stuff because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.040" end="00:18:04.180" style="s2">science evolved to do and so having to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.350" end="00:18:06.700" style="s2">deal with subject object interface plus</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.180" end="00:18:07.930" style="s2">the complexity of the objective we</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.700" end="00:18:09.580" style="s2">started there because it was an area</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.930" end="00:18:11.860" style="s2">both where you can alleviate the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.580" end="00:18:13.390" style="s2">suffering enhance human capability the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.860" end="00:18:14.620" style="s2">most and if you can do well there you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.390" end="00:18:16.270" style="s2">can do well with things that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.620" end="00:18:18.730" style="s2">relatively easy like cancer autoimmune</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.270" end="00:18:20.800" style="s2">disease mm-hm and other aspects of human</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.730" end="00:18:22.750" style="s2">optimization but so let&#39;s take in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.800" end="00:18:24.160" style="s2">single example let&#39;s take anxiety but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.750" end="00:18:26.590" style="s2">could have just as easily said</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.160" end="00:18:28.270" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s or MS or sleep disorders or</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.590" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">anything right sure let&#39;s say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.270" end="00:18:32.920" style="s2">gonna take anxiety which is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:35.080" style="s2">pretty ubiquitous right now and growing</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.920" end="00:18:37.150" style="s2">Lyuba quickest then we say well how do</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.080" end="00:18:38.920" style="s2">we fix anxiety well psychiatric cancer</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.150" end="00:18:40.120" style="s2">has been given benzodiazepine this</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.920" end="00:18:42.340" style="s2">obviously doesn&#39;t address underlying</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.120" end="00:18:43.600" style="s2">cause at all but in the process of not</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.340" end="00:18:44.620" style="s2">addressing underlying cause and just</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.600" end="00:18:46.570" style="s2">saying there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.620" end="00:18:49.330" style="s2">their GABA circuitry let&#39;s make up much</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.570" end="00:18:52.690" style="s2">much much stronger gaba receptor agonist</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.330" end="00:18:54.970" style="s2">exogenously you eggs honestly externally</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.690" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">override an endogenous system that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.970" end="00:18:58.390" style="s2">just seemed broken without understanding</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:18:59.890" style="s2">what was wrong with it yeah and then in</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.390" end="00:19:02.050" style="s2">the process of doing that create more</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.890" end="00:19:04.480" style="s2">dependence on that exogenous thing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.050" end="00:19:06.100" style="s2">then you fix the level of one in chain</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.480" end="00:19:08.530" style="s2">chemical like what&#39;s happening at a gaba</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.100" end="00:19:09.700" style="s2">receptor independent of the complexity</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.530" end="00:19:11.650" style="s2">of things that&#39;s normally interacting</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.700" end="00:19:13.210" style="s2">with which ends up meaning you throw off</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.650" end="00:19:14.650" style="s2">a bunch of ratios you throw off a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.210" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">of causal chains and so you get side</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.650" end="00:19:18.490" style="s2">effects so those kinds of single</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:19.780" style="s2">molecule interventions not only don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.490" end="00:19:21.310" style="s2">deal with causes so the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.780" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">pathogen assist can get worse</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.310" end="00:19:25.990" style="s2">but they end up leading to oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:28.420" style="s2">increased dependence and side effects so</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.990" end="00:19:30.700" style="s2">obviously inadequate approach to anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.420" end="00:19:32.320" style="s2">has to understand cause and understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.700" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">all the possibilities of cause and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.320" end="00:19:35.410" style="s2">understand them uniquely in each person</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:36.820" style="s2">and then have treatments that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.410" end="00:19:39.070" style="s2">customized to all the different things</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.820" end="00:19:39.309" style="s2">that can go on and for example that</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.070" end="00:19:41.350" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.309" end="00:19:43.809" style="s2">like how much of a particular person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.350" end="00:19:45.399" style="s2">anxiety is psychogenic in origin and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.809" end="00:19:47.169" style="s2">much is physio genic might be a first</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.399" end="00:19:49.389" style="s2">question is hygienic meaning at the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.169" end="00:19:50.740" style="s2">origin is primarily physical psychogenic</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.389" end="00:19:52.450" style="s2">mean the origin is primarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.740" end="00:19:54.220" style="s2">psychological if an ax-murderer is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.450" end="00:19:57.129" style="s2">chasing you you should be anxious right</p>

<p begin="00:19:57.129" end="00:20:01.240" style="s2">got acute PTSD from that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.409" end="00:20:03.190" style="s2">continuing to loop that&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.240" end="00:20:05.230" style="s2">then and so now you&#39;ve got the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.190" end="00:20:07.779" style="s2">afterwards from that kind of acute PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.230" end="00:20:09.789" style="s2">that&#39;s very different then if you start</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.779" end="00:20:10.929" style="s2">having anxiety after a head trauma where</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.789" end="00:20:12.580" style="s2">you actually damaged some neural</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.929" end="00:20:15.039" style="s2">networks or if you&#39;ve always had anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.580" end="00:20:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s may be related to genetic</p>

<p begin="00:20:16.480" end="00:20:20.950" style="s2">disorders or if you&#39;ve got your anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.879" end="00:20:22.749" style="s2">primarily after getting a parasite which</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.950" end="00:20:24.129" style="s2">caused a gut brain access disorder so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.749" end="00:20:26.409" style="s2">your GABA production in your gut is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.129" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">lower or etc etc so we find that there</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.409" end="00:20:30.850" style="s2">are thousands of physiologic</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.200" end="00:20:38.169" style="s2">and there&#39;s different kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.409" end="00:20:45.639" style="s2">different sub-elements so then you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.639" end="00:20:47.590" style="s2">to say well can we map the entire space</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.639" end="00:20:49.629" style="s2">of things that correlate with anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.590" end="00:20:50.860" style="s2">that could be causal and then can we</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.629" end="00:20:52.990" style="s2">figure out how to do differential</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.860" end="00:20:55.179" style="s2">diagnosis across all of them to see</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.480" end="00:21:06.009" style="s2">to the in symptomology so then which</p>

<p begin="00:21:06.009" end="00:21:10.779" style="s2">order of operations can all be</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.279" end="00:21:17.019" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got to be drinking data from</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.019" end="00:21:18.580" style="s2">some large large streams in order to try</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.019" end="00:21:20.139" style="s2">to have a reasonable guess based on all</p>

<p begin="00:21:20.139" end="00:21:23.830" style="s2">that you&#39;d want well so you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.519" end="00:21:25.210" style="s2">at say there was head trauma involved</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.830" end="00:21:26.230" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to have some kinds of</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.990" end="00:21:33.340" style="s2">have you get that or you might simply</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.970" end="00:21:35.619" style="s2">look at behavioral scans cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:21:35.619" end="00:21:39.639" style="s2">over enough time correlate well up to a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:41.169" style="s2">specific kind of trauma to the degree</p>

<p begin="00:21:41.169" end="00:21:44.110" style="s2">we&#39;ve got to be looking at whole genome</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:45.850" style="s2">sequencing and maybe at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.110" end="00:21:47.379" style="s2">gene expression transcriptomics or</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.850" end="00:21:49.659" style="s2">proteomics er to the degree that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.379" end="00:21:51.220" style="s2">looking at mold toxicity that causes</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.080" style="s2">gives us toxicity and pathology right</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.800" end="00:22:00.760" style="s2">that lauded data and right now it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.080" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">to even get it we don&#39;t have high enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.760" end="00:22:04.150" style="s2">sensitivity and specificity on</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">everything and it&#39;s stupidly expensive</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.150" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2">and then you can&#39;t get it often enough</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:08.710" style="s2">to see what&#39;s working so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:10.750" style="s2">diagnosis issue we have to get better</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.710" end="00:22:12.010" style="s2">and better diagnostic system so this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.750" end="00:22:13.660" style="s2">something that we&#39;re very focused on</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.010" end="00:22:14.920" style="s2">both what&#39;s happening at the cutting</p>

<p begin="00:22:18.520" end="00:22:23.350" style="s2">towards adequate and then once we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.040" end="00:22:24.970" style="s2">this shit-ton of data the interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.350" end="00:22:26.650" style="s2">layer is how do we actually interpret</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.970" end="00:22:28.240" style="s2">all that data where you aren&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.650" end="00:22:30.280" style="s2">looking at each biometric in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.240" end="00:22:31.750" style="s2">relationship to a reference range but</p>

<p begin="00:22:33.490" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">and cycling tricks to see inter causal</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.130" end="00:22:40.630" style="s2">effects it&#39;s ultimately a kind of AI</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.630" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">psychometric and physio genic data that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.300" end="00:22:47.440" style="s2">then leads to a process where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:48.910" style="s2">have synthesized all of the treatments</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.440" end="00:22:51.220" style="s2">that have been vetted as having some</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:52.510" style="s2">efficacy and then relating those down to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.220" end="00:22:54.130" style="s2">the pathways over which they have</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.510" end="00:22:56.200" style="s2">efficacy and then being able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.130" end="00:22:58.360" style="s2">customize that though is a decent</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.200" end="00:22:59.980" style="s2">baseline description of the future of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.360" end="00:23:01.540" style="s2">complex medicine personalized medicine</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.980" end="00:23:03.640" style="s2">what&#39;s that going to look like are those</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.540" end="00:23:06.100" style="s2">datasets going to be publicly available</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.640" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">to some extent or are these going to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.100" end="00:23:10.420" style="s2">developed almost like by rival hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.320" end="00:23:12.370" style="s2">or rival medical groups selling access</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.420" end="00:23:13.780" style="s2">to their own particular live datasets</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.370" end="00:23:15.130" style="s2">this is asking you to speculate</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.780" end="00:23:17.110" style="s2">obviously nobody&#39;s got the magic wand</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.130" end="00:23:18.340" style="s2">here let me go a little bit higher for a</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.110" end="00:23:21.250" style="s2">minute because the question you asked</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.340" end="00:23:23.740" style="s2">spoke to it medicine within capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.250" end="00:23:26.620" style="s2">is broken inexorably and unavoidably</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.740" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">because the theory of markets should not</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.620" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">apply to something where people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:33.550" style="s2">actually have a viable choice for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">prisons are a problem right one should</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.550" end="00:23:37.270" style="s2">not have a profit incentive that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:38.620" style="s2">against the liberty of the populace</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.270" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">right want for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.620" end="00:23:42.400" style="s2">military-industrial complex is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.480" end="00:23:44.200" style="s2">let me question that for a second oh it</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.400" end="00:23:46.510" style="s2">seems like if you actually completely</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.200" end="00:23:48.130" style="s2">flipped the model for example paid a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.510" end="00:23:49.420" style="s2">doctor for every month that you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.130" end="00:23:51.130" style="s2">perfectly healthy and you had no</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.420" end="00:23:52.630" style="s2">complaints if the incentives were</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.130" end="00:23:54.520" style="s2">different it seems like maybe the system</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.630" end="00:23:56.260" style="s2">while not being perfect could still be</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.520" end="00:23:58.120" style="s2">radically better than what it is now and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.260" end="00:24:01.450" style="s2">still be a capitalist system so this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.120" end="00:24:03.910" style="s2">the key thing that is a foundationally</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.450" end="00:24:06.429" style="s2">different system yeah is actually paying</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.910" end="00:24:08.470" style="s2">for health rather than paying for sick</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.429" end="00:24:09.850" style="s2">services right that&#39;s true so when you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.470" end="00:24:10.659" style="s2">really start to get into what it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.850" end="00:24:12.100" style="s2">take to do that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.659" end="00:24:14.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of problems right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.100" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">you get well individual responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.019" end="00:24:18.940" style="s2">of the people being problematic you get</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:20.230" style="s2">to have an adequate system I won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.940" end="00:24:21.369" style="s2">what it takes to actually structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.230" end="00:24:23.080" style="s2">right now because we&#39;ll have to dive</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.369" end="00:24:24.490" style="s2">down some deep economics rabbit holes</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.080" end="00:24:26.740" style="s2">but we should do that sometime if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.490" end="00:24:29.379" style="s2">want you do have to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.740" end="00:24:32.679" style="s2">don&#39;t have anywhere within the research</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.379" end="00:24:36.190" style="s2">or science or medical or regulation</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.679" end="00:24:37.990" style="s2">process an incentive for anything less</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.190" end="00:24:39.909" style="s2">than robust health and illness</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.990" end="00:24:42.759" style="s2">prevention right and that&#39;s even things</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.909" end="00:24:44.230" style="s2">like right now the IP is such that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.759" end="00:24:45.940" style="s2">got to put in a ton of money up</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.230" end="00:24:47.230" style="s2">front in drug development sever make</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.940" end="00:24:48.940" style="s2">that money back I&#39;ve got to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.230" end="00:24:50.499" style="s2">patent my stuff so that I can charge a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.940" end="00:24:52.539" style="s2">really high price as opposed to market</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.499" end="00:24:54.429" style="s2">competition on it which means I can only</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.539" end="00:24:56.350" style="s2">pursue patentable things so plans are</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.429" end="00:24:58.299" style="s2">out diet exercise right they&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.350" end="00:25:00.129" style="s2">getting that level of research funding</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.299" end="00:25:01.779" style="s2">and I&#39;ve got to do single molecules</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.129" end="00:25:03.610" style="s2">going through a clinical trial but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.779" end="00:25:05.169" style="s2">clinical trial shows can never do</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.610" end="00:25:07.059" style="s2">personalized medicine right because I</p>

<p begin="00:27:17.140" end="00:27:21.250" style="s2">about so far what are the Tier one</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.670" end="00:27:23.170" style="s2">causes of illness Tier one meaning the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.250" end="00:27:25.330" style="s2">initial deviation from homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.170" end="00:27:27.070" style="s2">because we can define health from a</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.070" end="00:27:31.510" style="s2">regulatory system perspective we can</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.540" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">define health as the total resilience</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.510" end="00:27:36.010" style="s2">and homeostatic capacity this regulatory</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.010" end="00:27:39.580" style="s2">we didn&#39;t say the homeostasis we said</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:41.800" style="s2">the homeostatic capacity how much</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.580" end="00:27:43.810" style="s2">deviation from homeostasis in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.800" end="00:27:45.970" style="s2">impulse can come that it can actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.810" end="00:27:48.430" style="s2">process and stay within healthy ranges</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.970" end="00:27:49.990" style="s2">so to put that in layman&#39;s terms if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.430" end="00:27:52.120" style="s2">think of your body is a bunch of Springs</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.990" end="00:27:53.770" style="s2">if I move the ball at the center of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.120" end="00:27:55.330" style="s2">springs away from the center how quickly</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.770" end="00:27:57.430" style="s2">and easily does it kind of shake itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.330" end="00:27:59.350" style="s2">back into a center position yeah most of</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.430" end="00:28:01.240" style="s2">time when we do labs we&#39;re looking at is</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.240" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">high or too low we&#39;re looking at let me</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.440" end="00:28:05.740" style="s2">know Stace we&#39;re not doing a stress test</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:08.110" style="s2">where we give us someone then a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.740" end="00:28:10.600" style="s2">sugar or little sugar and we&#39;re testing</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.110" end="00:28:12.940" style="s2">then how well does it stay in range in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.600" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">proximity to stresses right so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.940" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">actual homeostatic capacity that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:18.250" style="s2">determines the resilience of the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.750" style="s2">is one of the major things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.250" end="00:28:22.090" style="s2">pay a lot more attention to so then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.750" end="00:28:24.160" style="s2">can say that&#39;s health aging is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.090" end="00:28:26.170" style="s2">decreased resilience of the system you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.160" end="00:28:28.930" style="s2">can be totally healthy and aged but</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.170" end="00:28:30.520" style="s2">smaller deviations from homeostasis can</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.930" end="00:28:31.010" style="s2">take you out of health like falling and</p>

<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:36.500" style="s2">pathology but you have less resilience</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.280" end="00:28:37.910" style="s2">to pathological inputs so we&#39;re defining</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.500" end="00:28:39.950" style="s2">disease and aging fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.910" end="00:28:41.960" style="s2">differently disease is some deviation</p>

<p begin="00:28:47.030" end="00:28:50.840" style="s2">deviation sometimes we&#39;ll say okay this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.130" end="00:28:53.300" style="s2">autoimmune disease is preceded by</p>

<p begin="00:30:47.420" end="00:30:51.110" style="s2">it&#39;s not just an issue of like we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:31:29.470" end="00:31:33.410" style="s2">technologically advancing I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.580" end="00:31:36.110" style="s2">Diagnostics are gonna get a lot better</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.410" end="00:31:38.300" style="s2">and so whole genome sequencing is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.110" end="00:31:40.460" style="s2">get cheap enough that it replaces just</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.300" end="00:31:42.410" style="s2">partial genome snip analysis and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.460" end="00:31:43.910" style="s2">that&#39;ll become ubiquitous we&#39;ll have</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.720" end="00:32:10.250" style="s2">like proteomics is a folding of proteins</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.690" end="00:32:12.950" style="s2">what is metabolomic so we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.250" end="00:32:14.840" style="s2">looking at metabolic byproducts of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.950" end="00:32:16.310" style="s2">different types of cells what we can</p>

<p begin="00:32:31.190" end="00:32:36.380" style="s2">assess a lot you can infer things about</p>

<p begin="00:33:51.489" end="00:33:54.730" style="s2">that happens it&#39;s game-changing say</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.289" end="00:33:57.190" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like an autoimmune antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.730" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">merging or inflammatory markers or</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.190" end="00:34:01.269" style="s2">immune differentiation problems but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:03.299" style="s2">find that before that happened you had a</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.129" end="00:34:30.609" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to scale it because you know</p>

<p begin="00:37:07.289" end="00:37:10.230" style="s2">at the cost of something else right you</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.789" end="00:37:11.640" style="s2">can take steroids and get buff but</p>

<p begin="00:37:11.640" end="00:37:15.119" style="s2">adderall and enhance your focus but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.769" end="00:37:16.680" style="s2">gonna be at the cost of empathy or</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.970" end="00:37:22.890" style="s2">interesting those were the easy the</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.890" end="00:37:26.520" style="s2">where we tried to lift one variable</p>

<p begin="00:37:35.280" end="00:37:38.850" style="s2">increasing the empathy and the focus at</p>

<p begin="00:37:43.470" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">approach and then medicine which is</p>

<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:52.650" style="s2">to baseline enhancing baseline which is</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.580" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">kind of a biologic transhumanism if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.650" end="00:37:55.650" style="s2">want to think about how we evolve</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:57.750" style="s2">ourselves and develop ourselves to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.650" end="00:37:59.700" style="s2">further capacities those actually become</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.750" end="00:38:01.200" style="s2">ingredients of the same system and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.700" end="00:38:02.490" style="s2">the question where do you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.200" end="00:38:04.440" style="s2">psychological stuff and where do you do</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.490" end="00:38:06.420" style="s2">physiologic stuff is actually the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.440" end="00:38:08.370" style="s2">as where do you do within Physiology</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.420" end="00:38:09.930" style="s2">bottom-up stuff at the level of cell</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.370" end="00:38:11.250" style="s2">energy versus top-down stuff at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.930" end="00:38:13.530" style="s2">level of Connect tommix and brain</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.250" end="00:38:15.240" style="s2">patterns the answer is all of them you</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.530" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">end up getting positive feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.240" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">across all of them right you make a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:20.610" style="s2">healthier main at a neural hormonal</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:23.880" style="s2">neurotransmitter level it predisposes</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.610" end="00:38:25.740" style="s2">more positive emotions perspectives etc</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.880" end="00:38:27.600" style="s2">you do work at a meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.740" end="00:38:29.880" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.600" end="00:38:32.430" style="s2">so everybody&#39;s experienced where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.880" end="00:38:33.600" style="s2">feeling all physiologically because you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.430" end="00:38:36.120" style="s2">sprained your ankle so you can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.600" end="00:38:37.890" style="s2">out or because you are hungover or</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.120" end="00:38:40.140" style="s2">you&#39;re sick or whatever which then</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.890" end="00:38:43.080" style="s2">because you&#39;re feeling not positive</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.140" end="00:38:44.910" style="s2">physiologically becomes a state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.080" end="00:38:46.680" style="s2">an emotional kind of effect of that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.910" end="00:38:48.300" style="s2">then you start to perceive your life</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.680" end="00:38:50.610" style="s2">through that state and it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.300" end="00:38:52.410" style="s2"> colored glasses so then as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.610" end="00:38:54.060" style="s2">perceiving life through that state you</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.410" end="00:38:55.560" style="s2">start to have more negative thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.060" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">which leads to more negative emotions</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.560" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">which then have an actual stress effect</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:01.590" style="s2">on the body leading towards physiology</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:03.120" style="s2">and you get vicious cycle and that could</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.590" end="00:39:04.830" style="s2">start on the body side or on the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.120" end="00:39:07.590" style="s2">side either side is enough to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.830" end="00:39:09.000" style="s2">start a propagating process you can also</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.590" end="00:39:10.440" style="s2">propagate up where someone starts</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.000" end="00:39:12.000" style="s2">exercising leading to better ways of</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.440" end="00:39:14.430" style="s2">thinking leading to making new decisions</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.000" end="00:39:17.430" style="s2">about how one is gonna think and feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.430" end="00:39:19.230" style="s2">etc so McKeon&#39;s up being how do we stop</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.430" end="00:39:22.020" style="s2">negative feedback cycles everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.230" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">we start virtuous cycles propagating</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.020" end="00:39:25.650" style="s2">virtuous cycles so we want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:27.360" style="s2">pull the body levers the environment</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.650" end="00:39:29.460" style="s2">levers the relationship levers the</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.460" end="00:39:33.240" style="s2">ones are gonna provide the most lift for</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.470" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">an individual is going to be different</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.240" end="00:39:37.080" style="s2">for different cases which is where you</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:39.570" style="s2">need to do personalized assessment and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.080" end="00:39:40.710" style="s2">call it diagnosis if it&#39;s illness but we</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.570" end="00:39:43.050" style="s2">would call it assessment of its</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.710" end="00:39:45.240" style="s2">optimization so we&#39;re doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.050" end="00:39:46.800" style="s2">assessment on someone&#39;s physio metrics</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.240" end="00:39:49.590" style="s2">and psycho metrics and we see that there</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.800" end="00:39:51.060" style="s2">are particular biologic processes that</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:52.500" style="s2">are significantly off that we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.060" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">actually intervene in and lift those</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.500" end="00:39:56.520" style="s2">lifting the things where there&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:58.620" style="s2">issue is going to lift the whole system</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.520" end="00:40:00.690" style="s2">the most and so this starts to get into</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.620" end="00:40:02.700" style="s2">how do we do advanced human development</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.690" end="00:40:04.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a combination of everything and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.700" end="00:40:05.820" style="s2">things that are gonna be the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.050" end="00:40:07.680" style="s2">leveraged for that person based on</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.820" end="00:40:09.480" style="s2">assessment this not only leads to</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.680" end="00:40:11.100" style="s2">feature of medicine in the future of</p>
