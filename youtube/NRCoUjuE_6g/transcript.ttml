<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:44.020" style="s2">just a tiny little preview through what</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.030" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">we do under pressure</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.020" end="00:03:52.850" style="s2">okay so you guys have had a long history</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:55.340" style="s2">of calling perception into question that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.850" end="00:03:58.850" style="s2">we said well we have perception we only</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.340" end="00:04:02.300" style="s2">get the appearance of reality so we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.850" end="00:04:05.510" style="s2">the east this notion of perception and</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.300" end="00:04:07.310" style="s2">appearance as illusion in the West we</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.510" end="00:04:10.880" style="s2">have sciences that has shown that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.310" end="00:04:13.910" style="s2">perception is also not deceptive so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.880" end="00:04:16.430" style="s2">is the refraction of work the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.910" end="00:04:19.190" style="s2">postmodernist remind us that perception</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.430" end="00:04:20.840" style="s2">is vulnerable to the perspectives that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.190" end="00:04:23.420" style="s2">you take as multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.840" end="00:04:25.550" style="s2">perspectives and of course we have these</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.420" end="00:04:28.040" style="s2">cool videos would enough spread your</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.550" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">attention disorder cannot actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.040" end="00:04:33.740" style="s2">member know that you&#39;ve seen or actually</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:45.470" style="s2">right so we we kind of long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.390" end="00:04:47.660" style="s2">calling perception into question but</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.470" end="00:04:50.390" style="s2">there&#39;s a paradox here because every</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.660" end="00:04:52.700" style="s2">time you notice that but there&#39;s a dis</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.390" end="00:04:56.180" style="s2">privacy between the perception and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.700" end="00:04:59.510" style="s2">reality the fundamental when we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.180" end="00:05:00.770" style="s2">that the pentacon has some level our use</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.510" end="00:05:03.920" style="s2">of our perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.770" end="00:05:05.500" style="s2">so we because our senses ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.920" end="00:05:07.900" style="s2">verify these guys</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.500" end="00:05:11.350" style="s2">errors and we are silent thing is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.900" end="00:05:17.560" style="s2">affirming our trust in them even as we</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.350" end="00:05:19.390" style="s2">call them into question listen so we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.560" end="00:05:21.490" style="s2">look at this example I&#39;m not sure if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.390" end="00:05:24.460" style="s2">works on the big screen but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.490" end="00:05:28.060" style="s2">the smaller venue you can get the</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.460" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">feeling your motion right from your hand</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.060" end="00:05:31.870" style="s2">you know it&#39;s an illusion and we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.100" end="00:05:36.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a visual illusion so your signs</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.870" end="00:05:39.340" style="s2">painlessly poultry senses two things at</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.250" end="00:05:42.730" style="s2">the same time that that stationery an</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.380" end="00:05:57.640" style="s2">senses simultaneously tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.650" end="00:05:59.410" style="s2">there&#39;s an engine now in the West with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.640" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">long tradition after the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.410" end="00:06:06.940" style="s2">period of idealism for philosophers view</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:09.640" style="s2">these these great views like David Hume</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.940" end="00:06:12.400" style="s2">says makes no less sense to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.640" end="00:06:15.220" style="s2">building through the third floor we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.400" end="00:06:16.840" style="s2">them to walk out to the first floor door</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.220" end="00:06:18.610" style="s2">because he says because it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.840" end="00:06:22.450" style="s2">illusion that one is better</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.610" end="00:06:24.910" style="s2">yup of course you never walked out of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.450" end="00:06:30.070" style="s2">third-floor window sir that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.910" end="00:06:33.760" style="s2">kind of interesting so there&#39;s authors</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.070" end="00:06:37.210" style="s2">basically four different ways the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.760" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">have explained perception why does</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.210" end="00:06:43.760" style="s2">science work and perception is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:46.810" style="s2">and the first one is a transcendent army</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.760" end="00:06:50.150" style="s2">the transcendent argument says there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.810" end="00:06:53.690" style="s2">transcendent consciousness that governs</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.150" end="00:06:55.970" style="s2">things - with that in the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:06:58.520" style="s2">consciousness is also governs the laws</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.970" end="00:07:01.130" style="s2">of reality because that can second</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.520" end="00:07:05.090" style="s2">consciousness is kind of controlling</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.130" end="00:07:09.800" style="s2">both then our perception has some</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.090" end="00:07:12.130" style="s2">correspondence and the other argument</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.800" end="00:07:14.780" style="s2">that content for example is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.130" end="00:07:16.760" style="s2">transcendental argument no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.780" end="00:07:19.190" style="s2">transcendent consciousness but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.760" end="00:07:23.270" style="s2">suffering about everyone that has these</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.190" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">transcendental faculties like Pure</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.270" end="00:07:30.830" style="s2">Reason logic mathematics and science if</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:33.740" style="s2">you use your mom in this way then it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.830" end="00:07:36.470" style="s2">you&#39;re an accurate map of what reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.740" end="00:07:40.600" style="s2">is although we can never actually go out</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.470" end="00:07:43.700" style="s2">so that&#39;s the transcendental argument a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.600" end="00:07:46.490" style="s2">little later on mom I don&#39;t have that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.700" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">can have the positive so you still you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.490" end="00:07:54.290" style="s2">see most of reality is still we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:57.140" style="s2">get up because there are fixed causation</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.290" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">causal laws of the universe there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.140" end="00:08:06.200" style="s2">whole causal sequence that linearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:10.130" style="s2">makes that what&#39;s real through all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.200" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">positive laws of take place in our mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.130" end="00:08:14.040" style="s2">and because the laws are consistent then</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:16.920" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.040" end="00:08:19.260" style="s2">correspondence and most of us today</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.920" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">philosophers and neuroscientists have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.260" end="00:08:25.380" style="s2">naive perception is representational</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:27.780" style="s2">that there&#39;s neural correlates there</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.380" end="00:08:30.450" style="s2">somehow causal thing here in the neural</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:33.150" style="s2">correlates could neural representations</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.450" end="00:08:36.060" style="s2">of the world and then we primarily go on</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.150" end="00:08:38.130" style="s2">and participate with neural routers and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.060" end="00:08:40.729" style="s2">patients not so much with the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.130" end="00:08:44.760" style="s2">itself so these are all different</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.729" end="00:08:47.220" style="s2">correspondence with all explanations for</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.760" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">why our perception is not exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.220" end="00:08:53.340" style="s2">correct but it is the response somehow</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:55.950" style="s2">the problem with this is it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.340" end="00:08:58.170" style="s2">when I called locked-in syndrome the</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.950" end="00:09:00.330" style="s2">sense that we are actually blocked in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.170" end="00:09:05.100" style="s2">our heads and that we either the</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.330" end="00:09:08.030" style="s2">technology or God or some kind of third</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.100" end="00:09:12.270" style="s2">term to get at the world really creates</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.030" end="00:09:16.890" style="s2">a horrible metaphorical kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.270" end="00:09:18.900" style="s2">existential situation so but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.890" end="00:09:20.520" style="s2">something weird about locking some Joe</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.900" end="00:09:23.340" style="s2">so you see this picture you know the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.520" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">guys left in Randy&#39;s is out in the world</p>

<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.600" style="s2">he&#39;s locked inside his own head yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.920" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">someone will come better than his</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.600" end="00:09:37.740" style="s2">girlfriend come on business was Mia but</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:41.190" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing most of us can actually</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.450" end="00:09:55.110" style="s2">perceptual system do not have this</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.530" end="00:09:57.269" style="s2">capacity so see if I put it up</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.110" end="00:09:59.329" style="s2">you notice that sometimes as possibly</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.269" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">you think this but when you go home</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.329" end="00:10:04.620" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty much sure but this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:11.070" style="s2">what&#39;s operating with your dog of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.620" end="00:10:13.410" style="s2">that&#39;s the real so what&#39;s going on you</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.089" end="00:10:21.660" style="s2">participating with if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.769" end="00:10:22.230" style="s2">participating with this yeah give</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:30.899" style="s2">learn to transition with this then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.060" end="00:10:33.750" style="s2">will realize that after the broke you</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.899" end="00:10:37.860" style="s2">can let the world in this very simple</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.750" end="00:10:40.350" style="s2">beautiful way for example perception is</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.860" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">keyed into action if you read the book</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.350" end="00:10:46.019" style="s2">the physics of baseball you will find</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:49.410" style="s2">that I thought this to be made over the</p>

<p begin="00:11:24.370" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">possible it&#39;s just not true</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.920" end="00:11:31.870" style="s2">it depends what you&#39;re participating</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">with that of course when athletes reach</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.870" end="00:11:37.000" style="s2">this kind of performance what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:40.140" style="s2">not participating with is emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.000" end="00:11:43.360" style="s2">thoughts and fantasies and fears and</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.140" end="00:11:46.180" style="s2">mental concepts and often they&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:11:46.180" end="00:11:53.740" style="s2">of an I&#39;m here nine so what makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.510" end="00:11:56.350" style="s2">perception possible is not adding</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.740" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">something to expect but it requires</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.350" end="00:12:04.510" style="s2">being able to drop much of what limits</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:06.370" style="s2">our actual live experience it requires</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.510" end="00:12:13.590" style="s2">us to be able to learn how to drop that</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.540" end="00:12:21.710" style="s2">so there&#39;s a group of people if you read</p>

<p begin="00:14:21.329" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">accurately there is no man man is in the</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:37.410" style="s2">so Rawls of scientists of consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.410" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">receives about sixty million bits of</p>

<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:50.279" style="s2">broadly defines the conscious mind can</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.250" end="00:14:51.630" style="s2">manipulate concept from between 60 and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.279" end="00:14:54.810" style="s2">40 to 50</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.630" end="00:15:00.630" style="s2">information 99% of what we will talk</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.810" end="00:15:03.630" style="s2">about today is this one-tenth of one</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.630" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">millionth of what is actually conscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.630" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">when you compete</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:15.150" style="s2">this is probably the best oversight yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:19.550" style="s2">so this is how it works</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.150" end="00:15:22.560" style="s2">what are we participating with anymore</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.550" end="00:15:25.260" style="s2">this is the promise that I have left but</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.560" end="00:15:28.140" style="s2">it just shows that the level of mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.260" end="00:15:31.230" style="s2">space information is deselected right so</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.140" end="00:15:33.630" style="s2">for 16 million bits of information goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.230" end="00:15:36.540" style="s2">through all these neural gates until you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.630" end="00:15:38.640" style="s2">get these chops and most chunks are made</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.540" end="00:15:40.890" style="s2">up of a tiny for the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.640" end="00:15:43.770" style="s2">information of memories and fantasies</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.890" end="00:15:48.920" style="s2">and ideas and concepts of a chunk</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.770" end="00:15:52.890" style="s2">together as a experience so for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.920" end="00:15:56.250" style="s2">if this is not a person but life is very</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.890" end="00:16:02.390" style="s2">very very little perceptual information</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.250" end="00:16:02.390" style="s2">on the screen and just feel what it does</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:14.760" style="s2">so what are you participate in what cut</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:18.030" style="s2">is online this is not a person listen</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.760" end="00:16:22.350" style="s2">right so basic you have some white and</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.030" end="00:16:24.840" style="s2">black perceptual from angle but what</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.350" end="00:16:26.450" style="s2">comes online when I put it up it what do</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.840" end="00:16:30.080" style="s2">you participate</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.450" end="00:16:33.240" style="s2">right now not a lot of perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.080" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">experience but something is coming</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">online</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:42.450" style="s2">what do you process so there&#39;s a local</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.780" end="00:16:46.220" style="s2">perceptual information here some and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.450" end="00:16:51.300" style="s2">color with or graininess a little more</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.220" end="00:16:52.860" style="s2">sculpting but but what are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.300" end="00:16:54.600" style="s2">participating with you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">participating with the perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.600" end="00:17:01.080" style="s2">information so I would Harleen this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:06.030" style="s2">why it matters because this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.080" end="00:17:08.940" style="s2">perception it&#39;s a stimulus if you watch</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.030" end="00:17:12.720" style="s2">now your life from this orientation you</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.940" end="00:17:16.080" style="s2">will realize that you just need like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.720" end="00:17:19.250" style="s2">stimulated by media and technology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.080" end="00:17:23.070" style="s2">social drama them you&#39;re not actors</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.250" end="00:17:25.950" style="s2">living all that is in the background</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.070" end="00:17:29.880" style="s2">waiting for you to touch base with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.950" end="00:17:32.100" style="s2">I need for you to be alive information</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.880" end="00:17:34.890" style="s2">universe is coming from your left body</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.100" end="00:17:37.980" style="s2">and basically what we&#39;re just getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.890" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">with all the students 99% of your energy</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.980" end="00:17:46.440" style="s2">was probably reacting this it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:48.830" style="s2">perception students okay so how my</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.440" end="00:17:48.830" style="s2">favorite</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.810" end="00:18:02.580" style="s2">so the background these are slides what</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.580" end="00:18:08.550" style="s2">we want but what I do know my research</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.580" end="00:18:11.040" style="s2">different experiments that is that at 60</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.550" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">all those 16 million bits what are they</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.040" end="00:18:17.250" style="s2">doing well there&#39;s a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:22.680" style="s2">coming from the world</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.250" end="00:18:25.910" style="s2">and then here&#39;s our sensors and what the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.680" end="00:18:30.480" style="s2">background is with the background of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.910" end="00:18:34.560" style="s2">there&#39;s three primary processing modes</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.480" end="00:18:37.500" style="s2">what what happens in the body mind right</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.560" end="00:18:41.040" style="s2">is that each one of these is our</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.500" end="00:18:44.540" style="s2">perceptual organ and in one subsystem</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.040" end="00:18:49.590" style="s2">processes all that information and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.540" end="00:18:51.540" style="s2">creates exterior septa &#39;v space so some</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.590" end="00:18:53.850" style="s2">of you may have had experience in deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.540" end="00:18:56.790" style="s2">meditation or when we fall into sleep</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.850" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">with you almost if you&#39;re lucid dreamer</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.790" end="00:19:02.520" style="s2">where all the perception goes away all</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:04.260" style="s2">the thoughts go away your body and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.520" end="00:19:06.860" style="s2">perceptions go away and then you just</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.260" end="00:19:10.410" style="s2">get a tremendous expansion into</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.860" end="00:19:13.830" style="s2">three-dimensional space right this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.410" end="00:19:16.200" style="s2">the exterior section the body takes your</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.830" end="00:19:19.320" style="s2">hearing which is three-dimensional sight</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.200" end="00:19:22.440" style="s2">your circulation the way your body moves</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.320" end="00:19:25.259" style="s2">in space and says the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.440" end="00:19:28.289" style="s2">reality is spaciousness and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.259" end="00:19:32.299" style="s2">well-documented and subsystems in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.289" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">body my brain and recent neuroscience a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.299" end="00:19:42.259" style="s2">second subsystem takes and all the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:42.259" style="s2">serial processing puts it into a</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.970" end="00:19:52.230" style="s2">background foundational perception and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.299" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">interiors and this is my basic body</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.230" end="00:19:57.929" style="s2">well-being my limbs connected is my head</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:20:00.659" style="s2">where it&#39;s supposed to be and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.929" end="00:20:03.690" style="s2">how the guy ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.659" end="00:20:07.950" style="s2">three-dimensional pieces of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.690" end="00:20:10.649" style="s2">a three-dimensional world and then the</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.950" end="00:20:13.590" style="s2">third systems proprioceptive which</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.649" end="00:20:16.679" style="s2">allows us to take skillful action in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.590" end="00:20:20.250" style="s2">world the three of them together create</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.679" end="00:20:24.059" style="s2">takes up much of that 16 million bits of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.250" end="00:20:27.769" style="s2">information to enable experience to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.059" end="00:20:34.549" style="s2">possible yep the interesting thing about</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.769" end="00:20:38.429" style="s2">this slide is that anytime you trace a</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.549" end="00:20:39.370" style="s2">perception down to its finer and finer</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.429" end="00:20:42.600" style="s2">detail</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.370" end="00:20:46.360" style="s2">so for example in proprioception</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.600" end="00:20:49.260" style="s2">requires me to be balanced and part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.360" end="00:20:52.180" style="s2">the system of balancing is a little</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.260" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">little grain of calcium that sits on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.180" end="00:20:59.020" style="s2">saddle in my ear and as I move around</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:21:01.300" style="s2">that granule calcium is around so if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.020" end="00:21:02.170" style="s2">say if they don&#39;t talk about that grain</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.300" end="00:21:04.270" style="s2">of calcium</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.170" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a grain of calcium that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.270" end="00:21:10.600" style="s2">world right so when I trace any any</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:11.830" style="s2">perception whole organ in my body car</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.600" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">chase it down to what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.830" end="00:21:16.060" style="s2">happening I get to a point where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.620" style="s2">talking about the world what is it about</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.060" end="00:21:20.170" style="s2">the calcium I start talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.620" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">chemistry if i trace light going to my</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.170" end="00:21:25.120" style="s2">eye event eyes that talking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:27.630" style="s2">quantum effects on the retina right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.120" end="00:21:30.400" style="s2">in this is what we didn&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.630" end="00:21:33.460" style="s2">perception because when we trace it down</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.400" end="00:21:35.770" style="s2">you head for a point where conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.460" end="00:21:39.220" style="s2">we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the world or with</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.770" end="00:21:42.790" style="s2">us and so that intersection I call that</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.220" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">the hi-low select zone it&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.790" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">body in the world are so finely grained</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:51.730" style="s2">don&#39;t find it into each other that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:54.040" style="s2">they&#39;re there it&#39;s an interface it so</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.730" end="00:21:58.060" style="s2">fuzzy you can&#39;t tell which is which</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.040" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">this is why we can trust perception how</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.060" end="00:22:03.460" style="s2">the lower means it&#39;s a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:06.190" style="s2">position that says only the mind is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.460" end="00:22:10.540" style="s2">making a strong conceptual cut between</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.190" end="00:22:13.110" style="s2">what&#39;s the material and muscle it so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.540" end="00:22:19.150" style="s2">can you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.110" end="00:22:24.040" style="s2">practices actually touch base with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.150" end="00:22:27.610" style="s2">zone so if you did you would have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.040" end="00:22:30.730" style="s2">kind of experience you would have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.610" end="00:22:33.370" style="s2">sense of becoming luminous things were</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.730" end="00:22:35.110" style="s2">becoming luminous before my eyes they</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.370" end="00:22:38.250" style="s2">shone in a riot of colors that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.110" end="00:22:41.560" style="s2">continuously increase in intensity I</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.250" end="00:22:43.780" style="s2">look back and says it will all need a</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.560" end="00:22:46.590" style="s2">stained glass with sunlight shining</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.780" end="00:22:50.080" style="s2">through there the scene became a living</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.590" end="00:22:51.880" style="s2">scintillating dance of Lord the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.080" end="00:22:53.170" style="s2">of the trees needles begin shining</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.880" end="00:22:56.260" style="s2">verbal moon</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.170" end="00:22:58.630" style="s2">this is all the information is coming</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.260" end="00:23:01.840" style="s2">through the threshold with this person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.630" end="00:23:04.930" style="s2">consciousness the sense of me at a fixed</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:07.780" style="s2">location space and time expanded that</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.310" end="00:23:20.010" style="s2">became to like the whole circle of</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.410" end="00:23:24.670" style="s2">horizon was before my eyes</p>
