<p begin="00:00:01.060" end="00:00:02.710" style="s2">Hi</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.710" end="00:00:08.849" style="s2">I&#39;m here at the airport in Portland about 50 cities into what is going to be a hundred city tour</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.700" end="00:00:11.820" style="s2">It&#39;s going exceptionally well</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.670" end="00:00:16.649" style="s2">Audiences in each city and the people I&#39;ve met afterward have been very enthusiastic</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.859" end="00:00:22.979" style="s2">There seems to be a rapidly developing market for relatively long-form intellectual discourse</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.619" end="00:00:30.029" style="s2">Driven by YouTube and podcasts which have none of the bandwidth limitations of traditional media forms</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.029" end="00:00:34.828" style="s2">I just had two evenings of productive discussion with Sam Harris in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.020" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">I&#39;m going to post my notes from those talks on my blog at Jordan B Peterson dot.com</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.170" end="00:00:48.450" style="s2">We talked about the relationship between facts and values and the role that narrative and story might play in bringing the two together</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.879" end="00:00:50.829" style="s2">for better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.829" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">The Vancouver events sold out</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.559" end="00:00:58.799" style="s2">The next discussion with Sam, the third, which will also feature Douglas Murray</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.020" end="00:01:04.379" style="s2">Will take place in Dublin Ireland on the 14th of July at the three Arena</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.809" end="00:01:10.378" style="s2">Followed by the final fourth discussion at the o2 arena in London on the 16th</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.650" end="00:01:16.830" style="s2">Tickets for those discussions are still available. You can find them at the events page on my website</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.300" style="s2">That&#39;s Jordan B Peterson com or in the written description of this video below</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.220" end="00:01:26.780" style="s2">All the discussions with Sam are being filmed</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.100" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">And will be released in video and podcast form within the next few months after the remaining two discussions in Dublin and London</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.650" end="00:01:40.109" style="s2">Because of the positive response from audiences and from individual audience members</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:46.949" style="s2">I&#39;ve added another 19 cities to the 12 rules tour these include Rochester, Westbury Wallingford</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.290" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">Baltimore Durham Miami Orlando st. Petersburg and Jacksonville</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.290" end="00:01:59.309" style="s2">Cincinnati and Cleveland Grand Rapids Des Moines st. Louis, Kansas City, Denver</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.100" end="00:02:03.449" style="s2">Colorado Springs, San Antonio and Irving</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.969" end="00:02:09.719" style="s2">You can get presale tickets using the code doctor jbp until Thursday</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.720" end="00:02:15.869" style="s2">June 28 at 10 p.m. Tickets go on sale everyone Friday, June 29th at 10 a.m</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.599" end="00:02:19.289" style="s2">I&#39;m also touring Canada in July and August</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.900" end="00:02:25.620" style="s2">dates locations and ticket links are also listed below in the video description and</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.050" end="00:02:28.259" style="s2">available at jordan b peterson dot.com</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.530" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">Finally i&#39;ll be speaking in about a dozen cities in Europe in October in November and Australia in February</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.060" end="00:02:40.049" style="s2">Those venues and dates will be announced in the next few weeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.410" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">Thanks for watching or listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.690" end="00:02:47.759" style="s2">I&#39;m looking forward to seeing you potentially at one of these lectures</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.310" end="00:02:50.729" style="s2">Bye for now from Portland</p>
