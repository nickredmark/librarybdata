<p begin="00:02:04.259" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">than a day or two and they&#39;re usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:10.200" style="s2">pretty packed up with well whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:13.080" style="s2">associated with the lecture and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.200" end="00:02:13.890" style="s2">with press that the publishers usually</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.080" end="00:02:16.320" style="s2">arrange</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.890" end="00:02:19.890" style="s2">I heard you interviewed in Sweden you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.320" end="00:02:21.570" style="s2">were in Stockholm and you were had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.890" end="00:02:23.460" style="s2">half an hour to visit the city with your</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.570" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">wife yeah and you know you loved it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.460" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">that you know it&#39;s yeah well you tell</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:29.910" style="s2">you take your breaks where you get them</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:31.800" style="s2">well the thing is is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.910" end="00:02:35.460" style="s2">lecture tour is unbelievably positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.800" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">yes and a lot of this is is ridiculously</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.460" end="00:02:40.260" style="s2">positive you know like so if I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:42.900" style="s2">out on the streets now or in cafes or</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">you know airports I meet people all the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.900" end="00:02:47.580" style="s2">time and they&#39;re always polite and</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:50.880" style="s2">they&#39;re always happy to see me and they</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.580" end="00:02:54.510" style="s2">always have some very touching story to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.880" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">relate and and then the audience&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.510" end="00:02:59.070" style="s2">themselves are very positively</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:02.010" style="s2">predisposed to whatever it is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.070" end="00:03:06.660" style="s2">doing together and so that makes it a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.010" end="00:03:08.840" style="s2">lot easier to stay motivated and and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.660" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">to continue right you know I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.840" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">demanding because everything&#39;s scheduled</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:18.330" style="s2">so tightly and and I do a different</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">lecture every night every I find that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.330" end="00:03:23.549" style="s2">amazing because I give a lot of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">and I anguish over every word and then I</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.549" end="00:03:28.950" style="s2">have another one and it I you go up</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:30.810" style="s2">without notes yeah well I have a large</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.950" end="00:03:33.330" style="s2">collection of you know things that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.810" end="00:03:34.860" style="s2">know what how to talk about and usually</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.330" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">what I try to do is to formulate a</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.860" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">problem before the lecture so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">addressing a specific problem right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">then I can track how I would set up the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:46.019" style="s2">argument and then I walk through it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:48.360" style="s2">part of it&#39;s also an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.019" end="00:03:50.850" style="s2">formulate the argument on the fly you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.360" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">know to make the question what would you</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.850" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">say to formulate it more precisely and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:55.830" style="s2">to make a more precise and engaging</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:03:57.810" style="s2">answer and then I can use the audience</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.830" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">to judge whether or not that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.810" end="00:04:04.230" style="s2">happening and so it&#39;s also a real</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:07.350" style="s2">challenge to do that so I enjoy that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.230" end="00:04:10.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a excellent intellectual workout</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been recording the lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.079" end="00:04:16.109" style="s2">I&#39;ve been using fair some of them to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:17.970" style="s2">write the first draft of the chapters</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.109" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">for my next book and four books after</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.970" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">that and so you know I&#39;m I&#39;m able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">maximize the what would you say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:26.580" style="s2">utility of doing this at each event and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:28.010" style="s2">and my wife seems to be particularly</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.580" end="00:04:30.180" style="s2">well suited to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.010" end="00:04:34.590" style="s2">traveling like that she actually enjoys</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.180" end="00:04:38.640" style="s2">it quite a bit and and is a very stable</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.590" end="00:04:40.350" style="s2">person and so that&#39;s also helpful so and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.640" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">you know it&#39;s nice to have an extra</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.350" end="00:04:44.670" style="s2">brain along because things are scheduled</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:48.690" style="s2">so tightly that we don&#39;t ever have any</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.670" end="00:04:49.410" style="s2">room for error yes well we&#39;re going to I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.690" end="00:04:51.330" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.410" end="00:04:53.910" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how intellectually rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.330" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">we plan to be with you today because we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.910" end="00:04:57.210" style="s2">know that when you ever you&#39;re on one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:04:59.790" style="s2">these platforms you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.210" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">your ideas but on the fence planners we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.790" end="00:05:04.340" style="s2">want to hear more a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">about Jordan Peterson the man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:08.669" style="s2">desperately in definitely want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:11.300" style="s2">about your wife Tammy yeah and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.669" end="00:05:15.360" style="s2">you&#39;re so well known for your views on</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.300" end="00:05:17.730" style="s2">men or how your ideas have been taken up</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.360" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">so enthusiastically by young men but we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.730" end="00:05:23.640" style="s2">want to talk to you about women yep</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.830" end="00:05:25.770" style="s2">that&#39;s good so but one of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.640" end="00:05:28.710" style="s2">and I share is that we both grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.770" end="00:05:30.960" style="s2">Canada I promised Christine I would not</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.710" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">do my Canadian accent while you were</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.960" end="00:05:40.229" style="s2">here but you grew up in rural Alberta I</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:42.360" style="s2">grew up in Toronto and you are what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.229" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">country&#39;s most famous guru now since</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.360" end="00:05:49.290" style="s2">Marshall McLuhan um and but is the fact</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">that you came from Canada have any</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.290" end="00:05:54.240" style="s2">effect on your views do you think has it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">formed you in any way I mean what did</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.240" end="00:05:57.270" style="s2">what would it wouldn&#39;t would it be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:05:59.790" style="s2">same if you think you&#39;d grown up in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.270" end="00:06:01.890" style="s2">rural Texas how was Canada contributed</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.790" end="00:06:09.479" style="s2">to your worldview she&#39;s always looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:11.370" style="s2">for the Canadian angle well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.479" end="00:06:14.700" style="s2">particular part of Canada I grew up in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.370" end="00:06:17.010" style="s2">probably was formative to some degree I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.700" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">mean the town I grew up in was only</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.010" end="00:06:21.600" style="s2">fifty years old you know and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:24.180" style="s2">particular part of the world that I grew</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.600" end="00:06:26.250" style="s2">up in was really the last settled part</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.180" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">of the North American Prairie this was</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.250" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">outside of Edmonton correct yeah both</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:33.180" style="s2">400 miles north of Edmonton 400 miles</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.750" end="00:06:35.430" style="s2">yeah yeah it&#39;s right at Short so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.180" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">short yeah so the Prairie number the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.430" end="00:06:39.660" style="s2">Prairie stretches up that far north it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:40.270" style="s2">stretches up farther north in Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.660" end="00:06:41.500" style="s2">than it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.270" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">anywhere else in the North American</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.500" end="00:06:47.910" style="s2">continent and so we were at the tip of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:50.590" style="s2">viable farming essentially and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.910" end="00:06:53.470" style="s2">it was a new place and it was a rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.590" end="00:06:55.480" style="s2">raw place and it was a it was a rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.470" end="00:06:57.340" style="s2">harsh place in many ways be especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.480" end="00:06:59.140" style="s2">because of the winter and it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.340" end="00:07:01.000" style="s2">fundamentally a working-class place</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.140" end="00:07:03.460" style="s2">although a prosperous working-class</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.000" end="00:07:04.900" style="s2">place right because most of the industry</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.460" end="00:07:07.090" style="s2">there was related to the oil and gas</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.900" end="00:07:09.580" style="s2">industry on although it was cyclical</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.090" end="00:07:12.070" style="s2">when things were good working-class</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.580" end="00:07:16.450" style="s2">people could make a very good living</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.070" end="00:07:20.380" style="s2">this was during the seventies to be a</p>

<p begin="00:07:29.380" end="00:07:34.240" style="s2">you know the majority of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:37.300" style="s2">teenagers necessarily have the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.240" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">wonderful time of it I think adults</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.050" end="00:08:10.480" style="s2">all maybe it didn&#39;t it&#39;s hard to say I</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.260" end="00:08:12.940" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve lived in lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.480" end="00:08:15.340" style="s2">parts of Canada now and and Canada is</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.940" end="00:08:17.110" style="s2">quite different I lived in well Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.340" end="00:08:19.330" style="s2">for a while and it had this particular</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.110" end="00:08:23.110" style="s2">flavor of existence I mean mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.330" end="00:08:26.650" style="s2">Fairview I was striving to leave mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.110" end="00:08:29.140" style="s2">and to move ahead let&#39;s say or to move</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.650" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">I hesitate say up but somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.140" end="00:08:32.740" style="s2">different somewhere more urban but</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:34.690" style="s2">that&#39;s the case with many people I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.740" end="00:08:37.180" style="s2">the small towns all across the West in</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.690" end="00:08:39.610" style="s2">the US and in Canada are dying</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.180" end="00:08:41.140" style="s2">mm-hm they&#39;re they&#39;re down to nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.610" end="00:08:42.790" style="s2">because everyone&#39;s moved to the cities I</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.140" end="00:08:44.890" style="s2">lived in Montreal for a good while and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.790" end="00:08:47.290" style="s2">that was interesting because it was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.890" end="00:08:49.140" style="s2">very very different culture it was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.290" end="00:08:51.730" style="s2">culture that was to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.140" end="00:08:53.140" style="s2">stratified by language and by class and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.730" end="00:08:53.600" style="s2">none of that was true in Alberta</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.140" end="00:08:55.190" style="s2">because it</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.600" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">so knew that there&#39;s no class structure</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.190" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">so that was quite interesting right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:01.100" style="s2">you worked what I loved</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.120" end="00:09:03.170" style="s2">pulled a passage because I think as you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.100" end="00:09:05.240" style="s2">say people are born in small places</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.170" end="00:09:07.519" style="s2">everywhere and someone to leave and some</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.240" end="00:09:09.620" style="s2">don&#39;t you said I wanted to be elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.519" end="00:09:11.209" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t the only one</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.620" end="00:09:12.620" style="s2">everyone who eventually left the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.209" end="00:09:15.199" style="s2">Fairview I grew up knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.620" end="00:09:17.389" style="s2">leaving by the age of twelve I knew and</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.199" end="00:09:20.600" style="s2">my wife who grew up with me on the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.389" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">street knew well what&#39;s that thing what</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.600" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">would you call that what&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">that makes you want to leave and and set</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.839" end="00:09:28.430" style="s2">you off because as you point out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:31.190" style="s2">was no class system education was cheap</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.430" end="00:09:33.139" style="s2">in Canada oh yeah I wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.190" end="00:09:35.660" style="s2">cost it was talking people you were from</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.139" end="00:09:38.180" style="s2">a what middle class my father was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.660" end="00:09:39.829" style="s2">teacher and my mother was a librarian no</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.180" end="00:09:42.579" style="s2">no she had trained as a nurse so you</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.829" end="00:09:45.500" style="s2">know we had a comfortable I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.579" end="00:09:47.329" style="s2">suburban lifestyle essentially you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.500" end="00:09:48.860" style="s2">I&#39;m moderate middle-class suburban</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.329" end="00:09:50.509" style="s2">lifestyle that&#39;s what Fairview looked</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.860" end="00:09:52.339" style="s2">like it looked like a suburb that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.509" end="00:09:57.050" style="s2">built mostly in the 90s a between the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.339" end="00:09:59.000" style="s2">1950s in the 1970s so young Jordan and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.050" end="00:10:00.980" style="s2">the then young Tami and you have to tell</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.000" end="00:10:05.149" style="s2">us that story how you met but wanted</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.980" end="00:10:07.160" style="s2">wanted more well you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.149" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">one thing that is different to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.160" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">degree about class my father and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:16.759" style="s2">mother had both left two towns they were</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:19.430" style="s2">from and they were forward future</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.759" end="00:10:21.350" style="s2">looking people and you know most of my</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.430" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">friends who quit school and who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.350" end="00:10:28.220" style="s2">attend University they didn&#39;t have they</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t have that sense I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.220" end="00:10:32.420" style="s2">more developed sense of a world outside</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:34.939" style="s2">of what they knew and the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.420" end="00:10:37.339" style="s2">that my my father took us on long trips</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.939" end="00:10:39.589" style="s2">when I was a kid he was a teacher and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.339" end="00:10:42.290" style="s2">he had summer holidays and we drove all</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.589" end="00:10:44.300" style="s2">over Western Canada and down into the US</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.290" end="00:10:46.610" style="s2">long driving trips thousands of miles</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.300" end="00:10:48.829" style="s2">and you know that also gave us the sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.610" end="00:10:51.259" style="s2">that the world was a bigger place but I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.829" end="00:10:53.750" style="s2">knew way before I was 12 I believed that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.259" end="00:10:56.779" style="s2">I was off at least to university and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.750" end="00:10:58.759" style="s2">think generally in your family if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.779" end="00:11:00.860" style="s2">liable to go to university people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.759" end="00:11:02.389" style="s2">even really talk about it it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.860" end="00:11:04.689" style="s2">given that that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.389" end="00:11:07.460" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s something that you take in</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.689" end="00:11:10.870" style="s2">with every breath all</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.460" end="00:11:14.420" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an uncertain and unspoken</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.870" end="00:11:15.770" style="s2">expectation and maybe people make casual</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.420" end="00:11:18.080" style="s2">reference like well when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.770" end="00:11:19.100" style="s2">college but it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.080" end="00:11:21.110" style="s2">question about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.100" end="00:11:22.940" style="s2">whereas if you&#39;re from a working-class</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.110" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">background especially if your family</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.940" end="00:11:28.580" style="s2">hasn&#39;t pursued post-secondary education</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:31.040" style="s2">that isn&#39;t in the realm of unspoken or</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.580" end="00:11:33.050" style="s2">spoken expectation and it wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.040" end="00:11:34.490" style="s2">like lots of my friends including many</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.050" end="00:11:37.130" style="s2">of them who dropped out before they hit</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.490" end="00:11:39.410" style="s2">high school they weren&#39;t by they were by</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.130" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">no means the dimmest people in the class</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.410" end="00:11:45.520" style="s2">like they were plenty smart but they</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:48.710" style="s2">weren&#39;t oriented towards the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.520" end="00:11:52.400" style="s2">pursuing a career that that involved</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.710" end="00:11:56.110" style="s2">intellectual what intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.400" end="00:11:59.210" style="s2">engagement wasn&#39;t in their worldview and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.110" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">you know when you hear people on them</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.210" end="00:12:02.960" style="s2">let&#39;s say more socialist end of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:05.000" style="s2">distribution talk about barriers to</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.960" end="00:12:08.120" style="s2">education they are often talk about cost</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.000" end="00:12:09.620" style="s2">and sometimes cost is a barrier and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.120" end="00:12:11.000" style="s2">more of a barrier thing yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.620" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">more of a beer although there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.000" end="00:12:14.300" style="s2">plenty about community colleges and</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">state colleges where you can right get</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.300" end="00:12:19.190" style="s2">educated for a perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:21.770" style="s2">amount of money but for my friends no it</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.190" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">was never a reason that money was never</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.770" end="00:12:25.250" style="s2">a reason they didn&#39;t pursue</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:29.450" style="s2">post-secondary education it was more</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.250" end="00:12:31.100" style="s2">like a truncated view of time I would</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.450" end="00:12:33.320" style="s2">say you know there was more of an</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.100" end="00:12:34.700" style="s2">emphasis on the here and now only and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.320" end="00:12:36.140" style="s2">there were jobs aplenty I guess well</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.700" end="00:12:38.030" style="s2">there was also doubt yeah you know and</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.140" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">and well-paying jobs like it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.030" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">obvious that you were in better shape</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:44.030" style="s2">economically to go to university oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:45.710" style="s2">especially if you were doing something</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.030" end="00:12:49.220" style="s2">like working on the oil rig right right</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.390" end="00:16:08.330" style="s2">would say this is true I&#39;ve watched</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.100" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">people in their relationships</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.330" end="00:16:12.529" style="s2">you know personally for a long time but</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:14.089" style="s2">also as a professional because I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.529" end="00:16:16.730" style="s2">a lot of clinical counseling and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.089" end="00:16:18.560" style="s2">there&#39;s some things that that need to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.730" end="00:16:21.110" style="s2">a given about the relationship I would</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.560" end="00:16:23.959" style="s2">say it doesn&#39;t hurt to find the other</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.110" end="00:16:25.700" style="s2">person very attractive you know and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.959" end="00:16:28.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a mysterious thing we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.700" end="00:16:29.930" style="s2">exactly sure what it is that produces</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.190" end="00:16:31.730" style="s2">let&#39;s say chemistry between people</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.930" end="00:16:33.800" style="s2">although chemistry is definitely part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.730" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">what produces it there&#39;s subtle things</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.800" end="00:16:36.860" style="s2">that attract people to one another that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:40.940" style="s2">are way below the level of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.860" end="00:16:43.399" style="s2">so for example women don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.940" end="00:16:46.910" style="s2">older of men who have our each blood</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.399" end="00:16:49.010" style="s2">factors who if they had children with</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.910" end="00:16:51.410" style="s2">would be likely to produce a stillborn</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.010" end="00:16:55.430" style="s2">infant well that&#39;s definitely a category</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.410" end="00:16:59.329" style="s2">on match.com right well it&#39;s so strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.430" end="00:17:01.010" style="s2">though because well that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.329" end="00:17:04.429" style="s2">question and you know you know by older</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.010" end="00:17:07.670" style="s2">apparently and so there&#39;s or wearing</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.429" end="00:17:11.870" style="s2">Cologne well that then it would depend</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.670" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">on what type of right smell is a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.870" end="00:17:17.780" style="s2">strange sense and it&#39;s very deeply tied</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.199" end="00:17:19.670" style="s2">to very profound emotions including</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.780" end="00:17:23.620" style="s2">memory and so you find people attractive</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.670" end="00:17:27.709" style="s2">for reasons that you can&#39;t always</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.620" end="00:17:29.510" style="s2">determine and so so that that was part</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.709" end="00:17:32.270" style="s2">of it I mean I&#39;ve always found her very</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.510" end="00:17:35.000" style="s2">attractive and that continues and I I</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.270" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">liked her combativeness you know like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.000" end="00:17:40.970" style="s2">think that there&#39;s you want someone I</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:44.710" style="s2">think in a relationship that you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.970" end="00:17:47.860" style="s2">spar with and it&#39;s partly because you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.710" end="00:17:50.110" style="s2">have hard problems to solve</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.860" end="00:17:53.320" style="s2">if the person that you&#39;re with isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.110" end="00:17:55.419" style="s2">willing to put forward their opinion</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.320" end="00:17:58.029" style="s2">then you only have half the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.419" end="00:17:59.919" style="s2">power that you would otherwise have you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.029" end="00:18:02.289" style="s2">know and hopefully you find someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.919" end="00:18:04.210" style="s2">who&#39;s interestingly different from you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.289" end="00:18:05.860" style="s2">like not so different that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.210" end="00:18:08.200" style="s2">communicate and you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.860" end="00:18:10.630" style="s2">of that but interestingly different and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.200" end="00:18:12.549" style="s2">then hopefully they have the ability and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.630" end="00:18:15.700" style="s2">the will to express their opinion and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.549" end="00:18:17.980" style="s2">and then well then it&#39;s you know then</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.700" end="00:18:19.419" style="s2">then your interest stays heightened and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.980" end="00:18:21.639" style="s2">there has to be that tension in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.419" end="00:18:24.279" style="s2">relationship you know people think well</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.639" end="00:18:27.399" style="s2">I I want to get along perfectly with my</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.279" end="00:18:30.070" style="s2">partner it&#39;s like no you you probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.399" end="00:18:32.500" style="s2">don&#39;t you just get bored and then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.070" end="00:18:33.519" style="s2">go looking for trouble and so you want a</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.500" end="00:18:35.320" style="s2">little bit of trouble in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.519" end="00:18:36.970" style="s2">relationship and a little bit of mystery</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.320" end="00:18:40.409" style="s2">and a little bit of combativeness and</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.970" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">and the ability to exchange opinions</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.409" end="00:18:47.380" style="s2">forthrightly and and I trust her which</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:49.929" style="s2">is a huge element I mean when we finally</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.380" end="00:18:53.049" style="s2">did decide to get together permanently</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.929" end="00:18:55.059" style="s2">we were both in our later 20s and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.049" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">know one of the things that I had</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.059" end="00:18:59.980" style="s2">learned by that point and insisted to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:04.919" style="s2">her about was that we had to tell each</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.980" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">other the truth and she took to that</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.919" end="00:19:11.200" style="s2">wholeheartedly you know and for better</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:13.480" style="s2">and for worse because truths can be</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.200" end="00:19:17.830" style="s2">harsh does that include like does this</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.480" end="00:19:19.269" style="s2">have yeah well the truthful answer to</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.830" end="00:19:23.730" style="s2">that is I don&#39;t answer questions that</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.269" end="00:19:26.440" style="s2">are likely to get me in trouble yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.730" end="00:19:28.630" style="s2">my I have a son who will answer honestly</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.440" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">and it&#39;s infuriating but then we</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.630" end="00:19:32.620" style="s2">realized if you want the truth talk to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:35.440" style="s2">Tam well well that&#39;s the thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.620" end="00:19:38.409" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s useful to know truth is</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.440" end="00:19:40.240" style="s2">empowering truth tellers are charismatic</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.409" end="00:19:41.830" style="s2">and you know actually both my sons are</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.240" end="00:19:46.510" style="s2">like brutally honest which is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.830" end="00:19:49.649" style="s2">disconcerting you but it&#39;s minh see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.510" end="00:19:52.990" style="s2">it has made them very formidable and</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.649" end="00:19:55.809" style="s2">because of it people trust them and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.990" end="00:19:57.789" style="s2">friendships and just it gives them mood</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.809" end="00:19:59.860" style="s2">and you&#39;ve written a lot about this well</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.789" end="00:20:00.999" style="s2">you know if I tell my wife that she</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.860" end="00:20:03.339" style="s2">looks good in an outfit</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.999" end="00:20:04.809" style="s2">knows that I mean it yeah and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.339" end="00:20:06.339" style="s2">some utility in that and then if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.809" end="00:20:08.229" style="s2">silent and say I don&#39;t answer questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.339" end="00:20:10.509" style="s2">that she goes and she knows well well</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.229" end="00:20:12.129" style="s2">sometimes sometimes you know she&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.509" end="00:20:14.769" style="s2">you know do you like this and I&#39;ll tell</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.129" end="00:20:16.989" style="s2">her that I don&#39;t and and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.769" end="00:20:22.119" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily make her happy in</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.989" end="00:20:24.249" style="s2">the moment but but if I do say I like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.119" end="00:20:25.659" style="s2">she knows that I mean it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.249" end="00:20:27.759" style="s2">I&#39;d actually like her sense of style a</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.659" end="00:20:29.439" style="s2">lot so it turns out that 90% of the time</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.759" end="00:20:33.039" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty easy for me to say look I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.439" end="00:20:34.719" style="s2">think you look great and mean it and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.039" end="00:20:37.329" style="s2">know she&#39;s a fairly harsh standard</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.719" end="00:20:40.449" style="s2">bearer to like she&#39;s she&#39;s insisted that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.329" end="00:20:42.219" style="s2">I stay in whatever reasonable physical</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.449" end="00:20:44.019" style="s2">shape I happen to be in you know that</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.219" end="00:20:46.389" style="s2">was that was something that she&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.019" end="00:20:50.079" style="s2">demanding of and I would say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.389" end="00:20:54.039" style="s2">the same from my side and and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.079" end="00:20:55.349" style="s2">good at negotiating which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.039" end="00:20:57.729" style="s2">what do you want from a partner</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.349" end="00:20:59.859" style="s2">fundamentally what what do you want need</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.729" end="00:21:01.929" style="s2">I mean the first thing is is that well</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.859" end="00:21:03.609" style="s2">hopefully you like I said you&#39;re blessed</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.929" end="00:21:05.409" style="s2">with the fact that you find each other</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.609" end="00:21:08.619" style="s2">attractive and I think it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.409" end="00:21:11.559" style="s2">difficult for the relationship to begin</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.619" end="00:21:14.889" style="s2">or proceed or sustain itself without</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.559" end="00:21:16.479" style="s2">that but having that then what do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.889" end="00:21:17.979" style="s2">want well you want someone that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.479" end="00:21:20.349" style="s2">trust you want someone that you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.979" end="00:21:22.059" style="s2">build a view of the future with and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.349" end="00:21:24.309" style="s2">want someone that you can negotiate with</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.059" end="00:21:26.019" style="s2">and that&#39;s very hard to negotiate with</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.309" end="00:21:28.419" style="s2">people because they have to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.019" end="00:21:30.489" style="s2">what they think they have to know what</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.419" end="00:21:32.409" style="s2">they want or figure it out they have to</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.489" end="00:21:34.449" style="s2">tell you what they want they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.409" end="00:21:36.009" style="s2">satisfied when they get what they want</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.449" end="00:21:38.319" style="s2">which is also a very difficult thing to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.009" end="00:21:40.329" style="s2">manage and you have to continually</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.319" end="00:21:42.189" style="s2">update that because your life goes</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.329" end="00:21:44.709" style="s2">through different stages and well in</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.189" end="00:21:47.289" style="s2">your attraction wanes as we all know it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.709" end="00:21:51.129" style="s2">our stage of life not fatally</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.289" end="00:21:52.779" style="s2">necessarily for yourself but but no but</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.129" end="00:21:56.229" style="s2">you will go I mean you will not be</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.779" end="00:21:57.759" style="s2">twenty five forever so so that that has</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.229" end="00:21:59.259" style="s2">to be renegotiate yeah well and you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.759" end="00:22:00.639" style="s2">to work at that too right you know and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.259" end="00:22:02.259" style="s2">and that&#39;s something that people also</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.639" end="00:22:06.669" style="s2">don&#39;t understand because they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.259" end="00:22:09.669" style="s2">think that well that that all romantic</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.669" end="00:22:11.709" style="s2">interaction should be spontaneous it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.669" end="00:22:13.719" style="s2">like well if that&#39;s your theory then you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.709" end="00:22:14.330" style="s2">might as well just give up right now if</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.719" end="00:22:16.580" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.330" end="00:22:18.500" style="s2">get married because that like the only</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.580" end="00:22:20.179" style="s2">reason you can think that is because you</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.500" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">don&#39;t have enough responsibility to make</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.179" end="00:22:23.899" style="s2">romantic entanglement virtually</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">impossible and what happens when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.899" end="00:22:27.980" style="s2">married especially when you have little</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:30.169" style="s2">kids is that and and you both have a job</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.980" end="00:22:31.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say is you&#39;re so busy that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.169" end="00:22:34.340" style="s2">probability that you&#39;re going to find</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.640" end="00:22:37.580" style="s2">time for spontaneous mutual interaction</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.340" end="00:22:39.049" style="s2">is decreases to zero and so if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.580" end="00:22:40.519" style="s2">what you&#39;re hoping for then you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.049" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">going to have it and so what you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.519" end="00:22:45.769" style="s2">do is you have to make time for each</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">other and you know if you&#39;re dating when</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.769" end="00:22:49.309" style="s2">you&#39;re establishing a relationship well</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:51.260" style="s2">you put some effort into it you know you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.309" end="00:22:52.909" style="s2">you decide that you&#39;re going to go out</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.260" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">for dinner and you dress up to some</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.909" end="00:22:56.690" style="s2">degree and you know you try to present</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.470" end="00:22:59.090" style="s2">yourself to each other in some halfways</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.690" end="00:23:00.500" style="s2">mutually acceptable manner and you hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.090" end="00:23:02.090" style="s2">that there&#39;s going to be a positive</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.500" end="00:23:04.010" style="s2">consequence of that that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.090" end="00:23:06.139" style="s2">find each other attractive but Ben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.010" end="00:23:08.269" style="s2">people somehow think that once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.139" end="00:23:11.480" style="s2">married that the same amount of effort</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.269" end="00:23:14.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessary and that&#39;s wrong I would</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.480" end="00:23:16.250" style="s2">say more effort is necessary on the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.330" end="00:23:18.409" style="s2">front and you have to think it through</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.250" end="00:23:22.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like you know if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.409" end="00:23:24.740" style="s2">be bitter about the intimate element of</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.820" end="00:23:26.630" style="s2">your relationship how much time do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.740" end="00:23:29.210" style="s2">have to spend together each week and my</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.630" end="00:23:31.820" style="s2">my rule of thumb sort of derived from</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.210" end="00:23:33.620" style="s2">clinical observations is that you need</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.820" end="00:23:36.500" style="s2">to spend 90 minutes a week with your</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.620" end="00:23:38.419" style="s2">partner talking and that means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.500" end="00:23:40.760" style="s2">telling each other about your life and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.419" end="00:23:42.620" style="s2">staying in touch you know so that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.760" end="00:23:44.870" style="s2">each know what the other is up to and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.620" end="00:23:46.340" style="s2">you&#39;re discussing what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.870" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">to keep the household running smoothly</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.340" end="00:23:50.870" style="s2">and you&#39;re laying out some mutually</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.370" style="s2">acceptable vision of how the next week</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.870" end="00:23:54.289" style="s2">or the next months are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.370" end="00:23:56.539" style="s2">together right so that that keeps your</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.289" end="00:23:58.309" style="s2">narratives locked together like a like</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.539" end="00:24:01.159" style="s2">the strands in a rope you need that for</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.309" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">90 minutes or you drift apart and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.159" end="00:24:05.450" style="s2">need to spend intimate time together at</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:08.000" style="s2">least once a week and probably more like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.450" end="00:24:09.380" style="s2">twice and that has to be negotiated and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.000" end="00:24:11.389" style="s2">if you don&#39;t negotiate it and if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.380" end="00:24:14.260" style="s2">don&#39;t make it a priority then it won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.389" end="00:24:16.970" style="s2">happen in all likelihood and then well</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.260" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">well then you don&#39;t have it and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.970" end="00:24:20.389" style="s2">catastrophe because there&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:22.730" style="s2">many things in life that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.389" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">intrinsically what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.730" end="00:24:27.549" style="s2">engaging and meaningful and pleasurable</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:31.119" style="s2">and also bonding all of that</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.549" end="00:24:32.440" style="s2">and if you let that go then well part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.119" end="00:24:34.690" style="s2">you dies and part of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.440" end="00:24:36.519" style="s2">dies and well then there&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.690" end="00:24:38.919" style="s2">possibility of becoming attracted by</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.519" end="00:24:41.220" style="s2">alternative entanglements which which</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.919" end="00:24:43.720" style="s2">you would do if you had any spirit left</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.220" end="00:24:46.090" style="s2">right I mean that&#39;s the thing is if well</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.720" end="00:24:47.820" style="s2">if you&#39;re not if you&#39;re if your</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.090" end="00:24:50.259" style="s2">relationship at home is entirely</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.820" end="00:24:52.450" style="s2">unsatisfying sexually what are you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.259" end="00:24:54.700" style="s2">supposed to do with that nothing he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.450" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">supposed to just bear it I mean in one</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.700" end="00:24:59.080" style="s2">way the answer is yes because it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:00.549" style="s2">marriage but another way is well what</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.080" end="00:25:03.519" style="s2">that&#39;s all the fight you&#39;ve got in you</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.549" end="00:25:06.009" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna just let the erotic element</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.519" end="00:25:07.149" style="s2">of your life die and and accept</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.009" end="00:25:10.029" style="s2">everything that goes along with that</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:07.799" style="s2">negative incident this is what I find</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.390" end="00:27:10.740" style="s2">fascinating is that I I found you early</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.799" end="00:27:13.230" style="s2">on I said I&#39;d had no idea you I just</p>

<p begin="00:27:23.789" end="00:27:28.080" style="s2">know I found out who you were</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:31.470" style="s2">what is astonishing to me is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.080" end="00:27:34.770" style="s2">there&#39;s this amazing it just split</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.470" end="00:27:38.270" style="s2">between the positivity of your audience</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.770" end="00:27:40.650" style="s2">the diversity of your audience the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.270" end="00:27:42.600" style="s2">intellectual content of your message and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.650" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">then you get with a snarky journalist</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.600" end="00:27:48.809" style="s2">with an agenda I&#39;m not mentioning names</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:54.210" style="s2">but this would be this no baby no this</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.400" end="00:28:05.010" style="s2">want to blame the BBC it was Channel 4&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.880" end="00:28:07.020" style="s2">and then I and she seemed you know like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.010" end="00:28:10.590" style="s2">that&#39;s often she seemed intelligent and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.020" end="00:28:13.169" style="s2">capable of insight up to a point but</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.590" end="00:28:15.169" style="s2">it&#39;s almost as if something had seized</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.169" end="00:28:18.679" style="s2">her mind and she oh yes something had</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.169" end="00:28:21.840" style="s2">something for sure I think people in</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.679" end="00:28:23.730" style="s2">audiology can you apologize that a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.840" end="00:28:26.330" style="s2">generation some of our most talented</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.730" end="00:28:28.710" style="s2">young women are incapable of thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.330" end="00:28:30.450" style="s2">because of this idea where she thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.710" end="00:28:33.419" style="s2">maybe you mean or just it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.450" end="00:28:35.970" style="s2">openness to she couldn&#39;t and you were</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.419" end="00:28:38.309" style="s2">saying completely like interesting</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.970" end="00:28:41.130" style="s2">fascinating original things even to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.309" end="00:28:43.530" style="s2">who&#39;ve studied these topics and Wow and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.130" end="00:28:46.350" style="s2">no it was quite the day so I went to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.530" end="00:28:48.059" style="s2">Baltimore you said I did yeah well any</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.350" end="00:28:50.909" style="s2">but it just made me think a lot that day</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.059" end="00:28:52.590" style="s2">because I went there and I had to go out</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.909" end="00:28:53.730" style="s2">of my way to do it not that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.590" end="00:28:55.500" style="s2">complaining but</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.730" end="00:28:57.150" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason for saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.500" end="00:28:59.550" style="s2">know so I go out there and Baltimore</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.150" end="00:29:03.990" style="s2">yeah well I was talking in both okay so</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.550" end="00:29:05.340" style="s2">so and I showed up to the to the hotel</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.990" end="00:29:08.070" style="s2">room where this was all occurring and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.340" end="00:29:10.200" style="s2">you know what you expect generally</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.070" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">speaking even from journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.200" end="00:29:14.580" style="s2">aren&#39;t you know who are more of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.450" end="00:29:16.860" style="s2">attack dog variety or who maybe aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.580" end="00:29:19.560" style="s2">positively predisposed to you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.860" end="00:29:21.870" style="s2">ideologically or personally you expect a</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.560" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">certain modicum of professional</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.870" end="00:29:26.610" style="s2">politeness right you know because well</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:29.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to be there and you came</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.610" end="00:29:31.800" style="s2">and you in vyx eped it an invitation and</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.160" end="00:29:33.260" style="s2">all of that and so even with the channel</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.800" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">4 journalist Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.260" end="00:29:39.570" style="s2">she was quite polite and and forthcoming</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:41.850" style="s2">in the in the green room before the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.570" end="00:29:43.770" style="s2">interview you know it so she would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.850" end="00:29:46.080" style="s2">at least that professional persona which</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.770" end="00:29:48.360" style="s2">is it&#39;s not nothing right there there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.080" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">something to be said for for going</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.360" end="00:29:53.580" style="s2">through the emotions professionally in</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:55.920" style="s2">an appropriate manner but when I walked</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.580" end="00:29:58.740" style="s2">into the hotel room in Baltimore it was</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.920" end="00:30:00.150" style="s2">obvious that this interviewer had</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.740" end="00:30:01.530" style="s2">already made up her mind about me a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.150" end="00:30:04.500" style="s2">hundred percent and that she was</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.530" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">absolutely you know negatively</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.500" end="00:30:09.540" style="s2">predisposed to me with a personal animus</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:11.420" style="s2">an animus is exactly the right word and</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.540" end="00:30:14.220" style="s2">there was about a half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.420" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">photography session because it was GQ</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.220" end="00:30:18.180" style="s2">and so I was in that atmosphere the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.740" end="00:30:20.370" style="s2">photographers were fine I was in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.180" end="00:30:22.350" style="s2">atmosphere for about 45 minutes before</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.370" end="00:30:27.510" style="s2">we started to talk and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.350" end="00:30:29.490" style="s2">reason that I&#39;m so I&#39;m not as calm</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.510" end="00:30:31.530" style="s2">during that interview as I usually am</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.490" end="00:30:33.120" style="s2">I&#39;m a little bit harsher and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.530" end="00:30:36.500" style="s2">for that is that you know it just</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.120" end="00:30:39.050" style="s2">started off instantly combat it and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.500" end="00:30:43.110" style="s2">what I what I should have done you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.050" end="00:30:45.290" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult to be awake</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.110" end="00:30:47.670" style="s2">enough to do these things properly and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.290" end="00:30:49.380" style="s2">and the interview progressed fine</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.670" end="00:30:51.150" style="s2">although by the end of it I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.380" end="00:30:52.500" style="s2">I had maybe done enough interviews for a</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.150" end="00:30:55.350" style="s2">while because I didn&#39;t think I had</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.500" end="00:30:58.710" style="s2">regulated my temper as well during that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.350" end="00:31:00.510" style="s2">interview as I might have well for the</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.710" end="00:31:01.830" style="s2">first two minutes you were getting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.510" end="00:31:05.520" style="s2">then she brought up a question about</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.830" end="00:31:07.630" style="s2">anger and I just saw you kind of adjust</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.520" end="00:31:08.890" style="s2">and then after that it was smooth</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.630" end="00:31:10.750" style="s2">well that&#39;s good because it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.890" end="00:31:12.070" style="s2">touch-and-go you know and I thought boy</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.750" end="00:31:14.020" style="s2">you know maybe you&#39;re running out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.070" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">patience maybe you you know maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.020" end="00:31:17.559" style="s2">time to dial back on the interviews</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">because you know I&#39;ve had many</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.559" end="00:31:22.090" style="s2">interviews like that and they&#39;re very I</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:23.919" style="s2">find them like and it takes me like</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.090" end="00:31:25.270" style="s2">three days to recover I know and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.919" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">you got you start thinking yourself like</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.270" end="00:31:28.750" style="s2">what I should have said I should have</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:29.980" style="s2">said that and I Drive myself mad no but</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.750" end="00:31:33.669" style="s2">you did very well but it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.980" end="00:31:35.919" style="s2">interesting that what it told me was how</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.669" end="00:31:38.980" style="s2">parochial she was and she lives in her</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.919" end="00:31:40.990" style="s2">own little world isn&#39;t it more a little</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.980" end="00:31:42.730" style="s2">bit about the ideology of our time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.990" end="00:31:45.820" style="s2">gosh you encountered this everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.730" end="00:31:48.039" style="s2">I used to write about this wisely I put</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.820" end="00:31:51.909" style="s2">I would encounter it I mean I think part</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.039" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">of the issue is that you will</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.909" end="00:31:57.010" style="s2">acknowledge that there are differences</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:59.080" style="s2">between the sexes that seems to be I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.010" end="00:32:01.600" style="s2">know that&#39;s a hell of a heresy that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.080" end="00:32:07.950" style="s2">heresy because when I was reading your</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.600" end="00:32:11.220" style="s2">book there is nothing about it that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.950" end="00:32:13.210" style="s2">anti female in fact you you do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.220" end="00:32:14.770" style="s2">examination of the Adam and Eve story</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.210" end="00:32:17.980" style="s2">and you have this wonderful passage</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.770" end="00:32:20.320" style="s2">about like Adam being the originally</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.980" end="00:32:31.809" style="s2">aggrieved man who throws a woman under</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.320" end="00:32:34.390" style="s2">the perfect God you do you made her and</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.809" end="00:32:36.280" style="s2">the rules such as they are you know they</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.390" end="00:32:40.409" style="s2">seem very commonsensical they could</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.280" end="00:32:44.770" style="s2">apply to anyone so is that a fair</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.409" end="00:32:46.419" style="s2">surmise of why you get so attacked that</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.770" end="00:32:49.990" style="s2">just the very fact that you&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.419" end="00:32:54.030" style="s2">to speak about the sexes as being not</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.990" end="00:32:56.500" style="s2">unequal but different but equal yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.030" end="00:32:58.510" style="s2">well you know what I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.500" end="00:33:00.820" style="s2">that&#39;s part of it because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.510" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">threat there so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.820" end="00:33:04.210" style="s2">happened when I was in Scandinavia I</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:06.850" style="s2">just wrote a call him about this</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.210" end="00:33:08.559" style="s2">actually it was interesting being in</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.850" end="00:33:11.530" style="s2">Scandinavia especially in Sweden because</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.559" end="00:33:13.960" style="s2">they pushed the equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.530" end="00:33:15.850" style="s2">doctrine farther than any other country</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.960" end="00:33:17.590" style="s2">they invented it it almost started there</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.850" end="00:33:18.980" style="s2">and there like in the UN and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.590" end="00:33:21.230" style="s2">original</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.980" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">the Charter the Swedes were there</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.230" end="00:33:27.620" style="s2">they&#39;ve never given no no and so and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:30.010" style="s2">week that I was there was the same week</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.620" end="00:33:34.850" style="s2">that two articles were published on</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.010" end="00:33:36.980" style="s2">gender differences in in temperament and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.850" end="00:33:39.340" style="s2">in interest and the biggest sex</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.980" end="00:33:44.059" style="s2">differences that we know of that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.340" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">morphological are in interest so women</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.059" end="00:33:47.570" style="s2">are more interested in people by and</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.669" style="s2">large and men are more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.570" end="00:33:51.740" style="s2">things by and large and the difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.669" end="00:33:54.139" style="s2">is actually large it&#39;s one standard</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.740" end="00:33:57.080" style="s2">deviation and so that means if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.139" end="00:34:00.110" style="s2">man you would have to be more interested</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.080" end="00:34:03.409" style="s2">in people than 85% of men to be as</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.110" end="00:34:05.210" style="s2">interested as 50% of women and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.409" end="00:34:08.419" style="s2">a woman you&#39;d have to be more interested</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.210" end="00:34:11.000" style="s2">in things than 85% of women to be as</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.419" end="00:34:12.619" style="s2">interested as the 50th percentile male</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.000" end="00:34:15.169" style="s2">so the difference is actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.619" end="00:34:17.240" style="s2">substantial and it&#39;s certainly large</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.169" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">enough to drive occupational choice</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.240" end="00:34:23.000" style="s2">differences and it explains a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:24.710" style="s2">the configuration of people in the work</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.000" end="00:34:27.819" style="s2">absolutely well and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.710" end="00:34:30.919" style="s2">approaching parity in terms of workplace</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.819" end="00:34:32.389" style="s2">overall workplace distribution women but</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.919" end="00:34:34.040" style="s2">there&#39;s massive difference as an</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.389" end="00:34:35.690" style="s2">occupational choice like it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.040" end="00:34:39.260" style="s2">interesting for example to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.690" end="00:34:41.560" style="s2">website of the US Labor Department and</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.260" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">look at male and female dominated</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.560" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">industries and you know there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.760" style="s2">top 10 male-dominated industries have</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:51.950" style="s2">basically zero women in them people</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.760" end="00:34:53.210" style="s2">bricklayers being wonderful like people</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.950" end="00:34:55.550" style="s2">there are people through zones</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.210" end="00:34:57.230" style="s2">according to Camille Palio you find just</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.550" end="00:34:59.720" style="s2">a lot of men in the people free zone</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.230" end="00:35:02.060" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah and the women are in you</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.720" end="00:35:04.400" style="s2">ask a group of women and men would you</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.060" end="00:35:05.690" style="s2">rather spend the next three weeks taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.400" end="00:35:07.490" style="s2">a part of machine and putting it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.690" end="00:35:10.460" style="s2">together or helping a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.490" end="00:35:12.020" style="s2">work out their problems and the pool of</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.460" end="00:35:14.300" style="s2">people who want to do the machine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.020" end="00:35:16.670" style="s2">just far more men than well and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.300" end="00:35:18.440" style="s2">more men in women dominated industries</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.670" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">than there are women and men dominated</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.440" end="00:35:23.420" style="s2">industries at the extreme so that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.490" style="s2">nurse nursing yeah yes it is way more</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.420" end="00:35:28.540" style="s2">male nurses and more bricklayers</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.490" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">I&#39;ve studied these male nurses and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.540" end="00:35:32.930" style="s2">already you know gender activists are</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:36.010" style="s2">upset because</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.930" end="00:35:37.910" style="s2">they earn more than women and a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.010" end="00:35:39.860" style="s2">professor of Nursing at the University</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.910" end="00:35:42.410" style="s2">of Pennsylvania tried to find out why</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.860" end="00:35:43.870" style="s2">and she found out they immediately find</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.410" end="00:35:46.420" style="s2">out what&#39;s the best paying field</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.870" end="00:35:48.410" style="s2">subfield so they go into like nurse</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.420" end="00:35:49.970" style="s2">anesthesiology it pays a lot more the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.410" end="00:35:51.710" style="s2">men are there and just proportionate</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.970" end="00:35:53.720" style="s2">number and they&#39;re willing to work in</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.710" end="00:35:58.130" style="s2">CREP you know in st. hours they&#39;re far</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.720" end="00:36:00.490" style="s2">more willing to with gender differences</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.130" end="00:36:03.020" style="s2">is that men are more willing to move</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.490" end="00:36:05.900" style="s2">longer hours yeah they&#39;re more willing</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.020" end="00:36:08.090" style="s2">to to work outside they&#39;re more willing</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.900" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">to take on dangerous tasks they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.090" end="00:36:12.650" style="s2">likely to work in scalable industries so</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">like you can&#39;t scale personal care it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.650" end="00:36:15.740" style="s2">really very it&#39;s very very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:18.200" style="s2">they&#39;re much less likely to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.740" end="00:36:19.250" style="s2">part-time if they have small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.200" end="00:36:20.810" style="s2">they&#39;re much more likely to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.250" end="00:36:23.390" style="s2">full-time in the small business rather</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.810" end="00:36:24.680" style="s2">than this then part-time yeah and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.390" end="00:36:27.350" style="s2">women have their reasons to want to work</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.680" end="00:36:29.810" style="s2">part-time and Farrell also pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.350" end="00:36:32.870" style="s2">that if you work 10% longer hours you</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.810" end="00:36:34.490" style="s2">make 40% more money nonlinear nonlinear</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.870" end="00:36:35.810" style="s2">return on overtime that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.490" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">that&#39;s really useful to know you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.810" end="00:36:41.270" style="s2">it&#39;s closer to an employer they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:42.650" style="s2">some but it also marks you out you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.270" end="00:36:44.060" style="s2">like if you have 10 employees and</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.650" end="00:36:45.890" style="s2">they&#39;re all doing the reasonable job</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.060" end="00:36:48.140" style="s2">let&#39;s say but one of them is working in</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.890" end="00:36:49.640" style="s2">extra half an hour a day or 45 minutes a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.140" end="00:36:51.380" style="s2">day and you can observe that every day</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.640" end="00:36:53.780" style="s2">then that gives them an edge with</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.380" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">regards to potential promotion and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.780" end="00:36:58.790" style="s2">and the return on those edges is</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:37:00.440" style="s2">nonlinear and so anyways so I went to</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.790" end="00:37:03.670" style="s2">Scandinavia and it was the same week</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.440" end="00:37:06.170" style="s2">that two studies were released showing</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.670" end="00:37:09.230" style="s2">what had already been established beyond</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.170" end="00:37:11.090" style="s2">a shadow of a doubt that the personality</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.230" end="00:37:12.890" style="s2">differences between men and women and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.090" end="00:37:15.680" style="s2">the differences in interest as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.890" end="00:37:17.420" style="s2">actually get bigger as your society gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.680" end="00:37:20.570" style="s2">richer and as it gets more egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.420" end="00:37:21.800" style="s2">and and not just a little bit either</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.570" end="00:37:23.630" style="s2">that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.800" end="00:37:26.240" style="s2">interesting is you might think well the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.630" end="00:37:27.830" style="s2">effect is it&#39;s the opposite of what the</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.240" end="00:37:29.150" style="s2">social constructionist would predict</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.830" end="00:37:31.250" style="s2">first of all so that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.150" end="00:37:33.430" style="s2">to point out is it&#39;s not only that their</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.250" end="00:37:37.190" style="s2">hypothesis wasn&#39;t supported it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.430" end="00:37:39.200" style="s2">decidedly refuted and and none of them</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.190" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">have come to terms with that and and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:43.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not a small effect the the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:45.710" style="s2">difference between personality between</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.700" end="00:37:46.530" style="s2">men and women in Scandinavia is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.710" end="00:37:48.270" style="s2">larger than</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.070" end="00:38:17.760" style="s2">interesting I think is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:19.080" style="s2">there&#39;s this idea that mate</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.760" end="00:38:20.700" style="s2">that marriage is a patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.080" end="00:38:22.620" style="s2">institution you know that&#39;s primarily</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.700" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">put there for the for the utility of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.620" end="00:38:27.360" style="s2">of the male and think well like I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:28.530" style="s2">that&#39;s complete bloody rubbish and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.360" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.530" end="00:38:32.190" style="s2">support it at all but I think the best</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:34.530" style="s2">counter evidence is that well if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.190" end="00:38:36.510" style="s2">the case then rich people shouldn&#39;t be</p>

<p begin="00:38:36.510" end="00:38:41.010" style="s2">to oppress themselves but the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.390" end="00:38:43.110" style="s2">the matter is is that the higher your</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.010" end="00:38:45.360" style="s2">demographic position the more likely you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.110" end="00:38:47.310" style="s2">are to be married so marriage is falling</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.360" end="00:38:49.950" style="s2">apart among you know in the more likely</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.310" end="00:38:51.780" style="s2">the wife is staying home and but not I</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.950" end="00:38:53.820" style="s2">mean she will has all sorts of pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.780" end="00:38:56.010" style="s2">but she&#39;s not well there&#39;s an old saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.820" end="00:39:00.270" style="s2">anyone any woman who marries for money</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.010" end="00:39:01.260" style="s2">earns it yes but now okay this is where</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.270" end="00:39:04.230" style="s2">you might get in a little trouble</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.260" end="00:39:07.290" style="s2">because in your book you call men order</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.230" end="00:39:09.870" style="s2">and women chaos and you say order the</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.290" end="00:39:12.090" style="s2">known appears symbolically associated</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.870" end="00:39:14.670" style="s2">with masculinity and chaos the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.090" end="00:39:16.260" style="s2">feminine is also the crushing force of</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.670" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">sexual select yeah what&#39;s up with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.260" end="00:39:22.290" style="s2">yeah chaotic okay well it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:23.810" style="s2">men and women that are ordering chaos</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.290" end="00:39:26.610" style="s2">it&#39;s masculinity and femininity</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.810" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">symbolically and so what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.610" end="00:39:34.620" style="s2">fundamentally is that where our brains</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:36.900" style="s2">are wired for social cognition so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.620" end="00:39:38.940" style="s2">not natural scientists or natural</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.900" end="00:39:40.770" style="s2">sociologists that might be of bidders</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.940" end="00:39:43.800" style="s2">even though I shudder to think that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.770" end="00:39:46.820" style="s2">might be true especially yes well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.800" end="00:39:49.590" style="s2">yes okay triggering or maybe yeah or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.820" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">ma&#39;am or maybe were more were more</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">naturally people who observe through the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:39:58.740" style="s2">lens of fiction and that what we see is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:40:00.300" style="s2">the world as characterized and the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.740" end="00:40:02.610" style="s2">obviously is made out</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.300" end="00:40:04.740" style="s2">men and women and children and those</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.610" end="00:40:07.110" style="s2">seem to be our fundamental cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.740" end="00:40:09.420" style="s2">categories masculinity femininity and</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.110" end="00:40:12.420" style="s2">and and and then the category of</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.420" end="00:40:16.530" style="s2">children and those categories have</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.420" end="00:40:21.450" style="s2">expanded to take on connotations outside</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.530" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">of pure person perception and so you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.450" end="00:40:25.110" style="s2">know it&#39;s for this reason that if you go</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:27.330" style="s2">to a movie and maybe it&#39;s a Disney</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.110" end="00:40:29.490" style="s2">animated movie and I like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.330" end="00:40:32.190" style="s2">those because they draw on a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.490" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">symbolic well it&#39;s perfectly reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.190" end="00:40:36.900" style="s2">to see a witch that lives in a swamp</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:38.970" style="s2">because those go together like it makes</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.900" end="00:40:41.670" style="s2">sense you know the witch doesn&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.970" end="00:40:43.320" style="s2">a gleaming chrome high-rise you know she</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.670" end="00:40:46.170" style="s2">lives in a swamp guess that&#39;s in maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.320" end="00:40:47.970" style="s2">quarter room I think well that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.170" end="00:40:50.970" style="s2">that&#39;s well the hybrids would be better</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.970" end="00:40:54.470" style="s2">for that right you can take off better</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.970" end="00:40:56.910" style="s2">but there are categories of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.470" end="00:40:59.070" style="s2">Association that are natural to the way</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.910" end="00:41:01.350" style="s2">we think and the fundamental elements of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.070" end="00:41:03.690" style="s2">those categories seem to be gendered and</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.350" end="00:41:06.420" style="s2">so this is partly why I make reference</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.690" end="00:41:08.160" style="s2">to Taoism for example so for the Daoists</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.420" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">the world is made out of chaos and order</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.160" end="00:41:12.690" style="s2">and chaos is the domain that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.910" style="s2">understand and that emerges</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.690" end="00:41:17.970" style="s2">unpredictably but also the domain from</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.910" end="00:41:20.400" style="s2">which new forms emerge right because</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.970" end="00:41:22.770" style="s2">it&#39;s from novelty that the new emerges</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.400" end="00:41:25.010" style="s2">and i think the fundamental association</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.770" end="00:41:27.480" style="s2">between femininity is chaos is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.010" end="00:41:30.780" style="s2">association between what&#39;s unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.480" end="00:41:33.210" style="s2">and novel and what&#39;s new because new</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.780" end="00:41:36.330" style="s2">forms emerge from chaos and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.210" end="00:41:38.280" style="s2">that chaos is is bad an order is good</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.330" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">that that&#39;s no book both have their</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.280" end="00:41:42.690" style="s2">pathology both have their virtue</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">yes yes and and and what you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.690" end="00:41:47.250" style="s2">for and this is this is what the book</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:49.110" style="s2">concentrates on above all is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.250" end="00:41:51.300" style="s2">looking constantly to find the balance</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.110" end="00:41:54.840" style="s2">between those two so for example</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.300" end="00:41:56.970" style="s2">formally speaking the domain of order is</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.840" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">that place that you are when what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.970" end="00:42:01.970" style="s2">doing is producing the results that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">want to have produced so imagine imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.970" end="00:42:07.470" style="s2">think about the preconditions for not</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.380" end="00:42:08.700" style="s2">being anxious okay so the preconditions</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.470" end="00:42:10.230" style="s2">are that you&#39;re constantly making</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.700" end="00:42:10.680" style="s2">predictions about what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.230" end="00:42:13.980" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.680" end="00:42:16.350" style="s2">and those predictions are tied tightly</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.980" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">to your behavioral output so you act in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.350" end="00:42:20.369" style="s2">a certain way and you presume that a</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:22.710" style="s2">certain thing is going to happen and if</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.369" end="00:42:25.020" style="s2">your actions produce the results that</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.710" end="00:42:26.430" style="s2">you desire then you assume that you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.020" end="00:42:28.350" style="s2">where you are and you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.430" end="00:42:30.060" style="s2">doing and that your plan is intact and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.350" end="00:42:32.250" style="s2">that the environment is secure and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.060" end="00:42:35.369" style="s2">keeps your anxiety under control that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.250" end="00:42:36.900" style="s2">order and then you know maybe you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.369" end="00:42:38.910" style="s2">a party and you don&#39;t know anybody and</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.900" end="00:42:41.940" style="s2">you tell a joke and everybody looks at</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.910" end="00:42:44.130" style="s2">you like what you said was not only not</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.940" end="00:42:46.470" style="s2">funny but also downright offensive and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.130" end="00:42:48.119" style="s2">then all of a sudden you&#39;ve moved from</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.470" end="00:42:49.740" style="s2">the domain of order into the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.119" end="00:42:51.480" style="s2">chaos because you thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.740" end="00:42:53.190" style="s2">somewhere and you thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.480" end="00:42:55.560" style="s2">someone and you were thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.190" end="00:42:58.920" style="s2">with people that were of a certain type</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.560" end="00:43:00.720" style="s2">and you got all that wrong and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.920" end="00:43:08.910" style="s2">also suggesting it is gonna be the woman</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.720" end="00:43:10.470" style="s2">who says I find that really open but</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.910" end="00:43:12.600" style="s2">women are also more sensitive to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.470" end="00:43:14.670" style="s2">negative emotion so there is some</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.600" end="00:43:16.770" style="s2">slightly higher probability that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.670" end="00:43:18.750" style="s2">might be the case but then I think women</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.770" end="00:43:21.180" style="s2">are also associated at least in men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.750" end="00:43:23.190" style="s2">imaginations with nature which is part</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.180" end="00:43:25.710" style="s2">of the chaotic domain say as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.190" end="00:43:29.010" style="s2">culture because they&#39;re sexually</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.710" end="00:43:31.740" style="s2">selective so you&#39;ve got to think what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.010" end="00:43:33.570" style="s2">nature I mean we have that as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.740" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">cognitive category right we think of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.570" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">natural world we think of nature versus</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:40.410" style="s2">culture it&#39;s a fundamental opposition</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:41.820" style="s2">what is nature well nature is trees and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.410" end="00:43:45.000" style="s2">landscapes and animals and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.820" end="00:43:47.850" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t what nature fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.000" end="00:43:50.330" style="s2">is nature fundamentally is that which</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.850" end="00:43:52.710" style="s2">selects from a genetic perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.330" end="00:43:55.260" style="s2">that&#39;s nature that&#39;s the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.710" end="00:43:57.810" style="s2">definition of nature and it is the case</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.260" end="00:43:59.910" style="s2">that human females are sexually</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.810" end="00:44:03.180" style="s2">selective and it&#39;s it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.910" end="00:44:05.910" style="s2">component of human behavior so the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.180" end="00:44:09.960" style="s2">evolutionary theory roughly speaking is</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.910" end="00:44:12.510" style="s2">that the reason we diverged from</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.960" end="00:44:15.330" style="s2">chimpanzees eight million years ago 7</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.510" end="00:44:17.630" style="s2">million years ago is at least in part</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.330" end="00:44:21.210" style="s2">because of the differences between</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.630" end="00:44:23.700" style="s2">sexual selectivity between female humans</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.210" end="00:44:25.590" style="s2">and female chimpanzees female</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.700" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">chimpanzees are more likely to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.590" end="00:44:29.500" style="s2">offspring from</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:31.300" style="s2">and males but it&#39;s not because of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.500" end="00:44:33.670" style="s2">sexual selectivity so a female</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.300" end="00:44:37.300" style="s2">chimpanzee has periods of fertility that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.670" end="00:44:39.490" style="s2">are marked by physical by observable</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.300" end="00:44:42.160" style="s2">physiological changes not the case with</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.490" end="00:44:45.580" style="s2">human females human female ovulation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:47.500" style="s2">is concealed so that&#39;s a very profound</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.580" end="00:44:49.330" style="s2">biological difference between human</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.500" end="00:44:51.010" style="s2">females and chimpanzees and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.330" end="00:44:53.320" style="s2">chimpanzee females will mate with any</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.010" end="00:44:56.380" style="s2">male but the dominant males chase the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.320" end="00:44:58.510" style="s2">subordinate males away but human females</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.380" end="00:45:00.850" style="s2">are sexually selective and so and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.510" end="00:45:04.560" style="s2">not a trivial fact so you have twice as</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.850" end="00:45:07.360" style="s2">many female ancestors as male ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.560" end="00:45:09.610" style="s2">you think well how can that be well</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.360" end="00:45:11.380" style="s2">imagine that on average every single</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.610" end="00:45:13.240" style="s2">human female has had one child</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.380" end="00:45:15.100" style="s2">throughout the entire course of history</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.240" end="00:45:17.500" style="s2">which is approximately correct</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.100" end="00:45:20.910" style="s2">by the way then imagine that half of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.500" end="00:45:24.850" style="s2">man had zero and the other half had two</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.910" end="00:45:27.270" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s roughly the case so half</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.850" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">of males historically speaking have been</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.270" end="00:45:32.290" style="s2">repres and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:34.090" style="s2">because of female sexual selectivity so</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.290" end="00:45:36.190" style="s2">it is actually the case that female</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.090" end="00:45:38.380" style="s2">humans are nature it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.190" end="00:45:40.810" style="s2">they&#39;re that that they&#39;re associated</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.380" end="00:45:43.510" style="s2">with nature symbolically as far as repre</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.810" end="00:45:45.790" style="s2">is concerned they are the force of</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.510" end="00:45:47.500" style="s2">nature that does the selection and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.790" end="00:45:49.780" style="s2">their nature in the most fundamental way</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.500" end="00:45:51.820" style="s2">and there is a chaotic element of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.780" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">at least in relationship to men and also</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.820" end="00:45:58.120" style="s2">in relationship to women because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:46:00.850" style="s2">of the female on female competition is</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.120" end="00:46:03.610" style="s2">competition that&#39;s chaotic for the right</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.850" end="00:46:05.950" style="s2">to be sexually selective right not only</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.610" end="00:46:08.020" style="s2">with regards to men which drives a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.950" end="00:46:10.030" style="s2">of politicking but also in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.020" end="00:46:12.550" style="s2">to each other because part of what human</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.030" end="00:46:15.640" style="s2">females do is jockey for position in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.550" end="00:46:17.500" style="s2">female dominance hierarchy for the top</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.640" end="00:46:20.290" style="s2">position which is the woman who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.500" end="00:46:22.300" style="s2">be most sexually selective and so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.290" end="00:46:24.400" style="s2">draws female female competition and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.300" end="00:46:26.260" style="s2">a different dynamic there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.400" end="00:46:27.700" style="s2">similarities between female female</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.260" end="00:46:29.650" style="s2">competition and male-male competition</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.700" end="00:46:31.950" style="s2">but there are also differences and</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.650" end="00:46:34.150" style="s2">they&#39;re pronounced so men for example</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.950" end="00:46:36.760" style="s2">while men are more likely to compute</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.150" end="00:46:38.320" style="s2">compete for socioeconomic status and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.760" end="00:46:40.600" style="s2">that&#39;s partly because that drives female</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.320" end="00:46:40.990" style="s2">made choice so the correlation for men</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.600" end="00:46:43.930" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.990" end="00:46:48.160" style="s2">socioeconomic status and sexual success</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.930" end="00:46:50.350" style="s2">is about 0.6 and for women it&#39;s 0-0 in</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.160" end="00:46:52.150" style="s2">fact it&#39;s actually slightly negative so</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.350" end="00:46:53.890" style="s2">and that&#39;s a huge difference between men</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.150" end="00:46:56.950" style="s2">and women but you know that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.890" end="00:46:59.110" style="s2">anthropologist Sarah hurdie Hrdy</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.950" end="00:47:00.940" style="s2">and she&#39;s like my favorite feminist</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.110" end="00:47:03.070" style="s2">theorist although as she would say I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.940" end="00:47:07.660" style="s2">theorist who happens to be a feminist</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.070" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">but she studied primate behavior and she</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.660" end="00:47:10.750" style="s2">watched she looked at the women very</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:14.190" style="s2">care they were the females and I went</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.750" end="00:47:18.119" style="s2">very carefully and looked at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.190" end="00:47:23.700" style="s2">chimpanzees and gazelles and found that</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.119" end="00:47:25.540" style="s2">the female minissha like male</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.700" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">primatologists would look and say oh the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.540" end="00:47:29.650" style="s2">females the males are dominant and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:31.630" style="s2">females are so cooperative she looked</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.650" end="00:47:33.310" style="s2">more carefully and so the females</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.630" end="00:47:36.070" style="s2">weren&#39;t exactly cooperative like they</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.310" end="00:47:36.640" style="s2">would pass around their infants their</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.070" end="00:47:39.520" style="s2">baby</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.640" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">you know whenever they were and would</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.520" end="00:47:45.150" style="s2">fine and so the male primatologist say</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:48.030" style="s2">oh they&#39;re they&#39;re so kind and caring</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.150" end="00:47:50.859" style="s2">she found out that when it was not your</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.030" end="00:47:52.630" style="s2">it was not hers they would take little</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.859" end="00:47:54.520" style="s2">Tufts of hair that wouldn&#39;t come out or</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.630" end="00:47:56.859" style="s2">they&#39;d do something to the eyes and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.520" end="00:47:59.140" style="s2">the baby would like be injured and she</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.859" end="00:48:01.270" style="s2">saw all this violence especially true in</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.140" end="00:48:02.590" style="s2">their status differentiation yes so</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.270" end="00:48:04.330" style="s2">that&#39;s much more likely that&#39;ll happen</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.590" end="00:48:06.190" style="s2">when a higher status female is taking</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.330" end="00:48:08.950" style="s2">care of a lower status infant exactly</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.190" end="00:48:11.109" style="s2">and she said the great tragedy well not</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.950" end="00:48:13.780" style="s2">tragedy she&#39;d the reality of our species</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.109" end="00:48:16.600" style="s2">in fact the subtitle of her book is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.780" end="00:48:19.600" style="s2">the woman who never revolved we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.600" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">evolve for niceness and cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.600" end="00:48:26.770" style="s2">there&#39;s an immense competition and we</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:29.170" style="s2">can according to her we are its</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.770" end="00:48:33.660" style="s2">indelibly you know marked in our nature</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.170" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">to compete for the dominant males and</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.660" end="00:48:38.619" style="s2">there&#39;s in - and that seems to cross</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:39.670" style="s2">culturally as well that does flatten out</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.619" end="00:48:41.859" style="s2">a little bit in the more egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.670" end="00:48:43.510" style="s2">societies yeah instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.859" end="00:48:45.609" style="s2">exaggerated it does flatten to some</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.510" end="00:48:47.560" style="s2">degree so you could imagine that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.609" end="00:48:50.920" style="s2">a biological component and a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.560" end="00:48:53.770" style="s2">component and both in in in that case if</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.920" end="00:48:54.700" style="s2">you modify the cultural component then</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.770" end="00:48:58.359" style="s2">that seems to</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.700" end="00:48:59.380" style="s2">decrease the overall so like let me be</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.359" end="00:49:03.640" style="s2">more clear about this</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.380" end="00:49:05.920" style="s2">women are less prone to mate up across</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.640" end="00:49:07.540" style="s2">an up status hierarchies in Scandinavia</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.920" end="00:49:09.369" style="s2">than they are in less egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.540" end="00:49:12.460" style="s2">countries but they&#39;re still prone to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.369" end="00:49:14.050" style="s2">it so worldwide for example women young</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.460" end="00:49:16.359" style="s2">women find men who are about four years</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.050" end="00:49:19.210" style="s2">older than them maximally attractive and</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.359" end="00:49:20.380" style="s2">they tend to mate across and up status</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.210" end="00:49:22.450" style="s2">hierarchies and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.380" end="00:49:25.089" style="s2">consequences of that for example is that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.450" end="00:49:28.329" style="s2">as women have entered the workforce</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.089" end="00:49:31.300" style="s2">they&#39;ve actually driven inequality</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.329" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">because rich women will only marry rich</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.300" end="00:49:35.829" style="s2">men men as rich as them or richer</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:38.290" style="s2">whereas rich men will marry women who</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.829" end="00:49:40.270" style="s2">are poorer than them but women won&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.290" end="00:49:42.280" style="s2">so what that means is it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.270" end="00:49:44.170" style="s2">factor that&#39;s pooling wealth in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.280" end="00:49:46.030" style="s2">hands of fewer and fewer people this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.170" end="00:49:47.800" style="s2">also sorted of mating now and you just</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.030" end="00:49:50.320" style="s2">find someone with your background you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.800" end="00:49:52.030" style="s2">wear as a doctor might have once married</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.320" end="00:49:54.730" style="s2">is secretary you now marries another</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.030" end="00:49:56.500" style="s2">doctor yeah well can I ask then stepping</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.730" end="00:49:59.829" style="s2">a little bit back from primates as well</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.500" end="00:50:04.300" style="s2">how does this selection work in the era</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.829" end="00:50:06.940" style="s2">of swiping right and left how what is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.300" end="00:50:09.310" style="s2">your reaction to the way young people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.940" end="00:50:11.710" style="s2">date today oh that&#39;s a good I was really</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.310" end="00:50:13.480" style="s2">hoping we&#39;d get into that you were very</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.710" end="00:50:16.359" style="s2">into the monkeys so I didn&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.480" end="00:50:18.369" style="s2">interrupt no no well well I should close</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.359" end="00:50:19.930" style="s2">off the Scandinavian discussion just by</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.369" end="00:50:21.280" style="s2">pointing out and this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.930" end="00:50:23.710" style="s2">the Scandinavians are really going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.280" end="00:50:26.589" style="s2">have to wrestle with is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.710" end="00:50:28.900" style="s2">Institute effective policies to promote</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.589" end="00:50:31.540" style="s2">equality of opportunity which the</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.900" end="00:50:33.940" style="s2">Scandinavians have done you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.540" end="00:50:35.349" style="s2">produce some equality so like a 50-50</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.940" end="00:50:36.970" style="s2">distribution of men and women in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.349" end="00:50:39.550" style="s2">workplace but you&#39;re also going to</p>

<p begin="00:51:18.700" end="00:51:22.150" style="s2">actually turns out to be a very</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">reasons and they should look at the data</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.800" end="00:51:49.420" style="s2">I mean it it&#39;s just a cliche now of in a</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.540" end="00:51:52.360" style="s2">group of activists and they&#39;ll say oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.420" end="00:51:54.390" style="s2">well we need in order for women to</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.360" end="00:51:57.730" style="s2">achieve equality we need government</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.390" end="00:52:00.820" style="s2">funded day care and we need they have it</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.730" end="00:52:03.880" style="s2">in Sweden yeah Sweden has fewer women in</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.820" end="00:52:06.340" style="s2">managerial levels American women are</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.880" end="00:52:07.960" style="s2">ahead in fact now they have Jenna they</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.340" end="00:52:10.960" style="s2">have quotas over there so they need</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.960" end="00:52:11.620" style="s2">female CEOs and females on board hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.960" end="00:52:13.360" style="s2">made any difference</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.620" end="00:52:15.760" style="s2">they&#39;re bringing in mime American women</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.360" end="00:52:17.440" style="s2">because we&#39;re so much further ahead so</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.760" end="00:52:18.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like no difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.440" end="00:52:20.530" style="s2">distribution of men and women lower than</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.940" end="00:52:23.500" style="s2">though it&#39;s it&#39;s called the Nordic</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.530" end="00:52:25.210" style="s2">paradox and okay you guys are so wonky I</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.500" end="00:52:28.950" style="s2">will get back okay yeah yes that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.210" end="00:52:31.960" style="s2">good well we all want to get back to</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.950" end="00:52:34.180" style="s2">well I was thinking this morning about I</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.960" end="00:52:36.490" style="s2">was talking to a variety of political</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.180" end="00:52:39.010" style="s2">types and we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.490" end="00:52:40.690" style="s2">morning yeah in DC it hard to believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.010" end="00:52:42.430" style="s2">hard to believe no I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.690" end="00:52:44.290" style="s2">telling you a bunch of Republicans here</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.430" end="00:52:46.120" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been talking to Democrats as</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.290" end="00:52:50.130" style="s2">well but it was mostly Republicans here</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.120" end="00:52:53.320" style="s2">and we were talking about abortion and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.130" end="00:52:55.440" style="s2">made a case that that&#39;s really not a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.320" end="00:52:58.930" style="s2">very productive discussion because</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.440" end="00:53:03.970" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about a problem way too</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.930" end="00:53:05.710" style="s2">late in the sequence of problems so by</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.970" end="00:53:08.050" style="s2">the time the discussion starts to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.710" end="00:53:09.490" style="s2">about abortion there&#39;s 50 problems that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.050" end="00:53:11.560" style="s2">have already emerged that no one has</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.490" end="00:53:13.750" style="s2">addressed and some of those problems are</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.560" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">the fundamental problem is how human</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.750" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">beings should regulate their sexual</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:19.360" style="s2">behavior and that&#39;s a big problem and</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:21.170" style="s2">you think well and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.360" end="00:53:22.820" style="s2">interesting thing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.170" end="00:53:25.310" style="s2">you know the people on the right would</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.820" end="00:53:27.950" style="s2">say well that&#39;s easy is like don&#39;t sleep</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.310" end="00:53:29.600" style="s2">around and and get married and have sex</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.950" end="00:53:30.260" style="s2">with your marital partner and that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.600" end="00:53:32.600" style="s2">the problem</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.260" end="00:53:33.950" style="s2">so there&#39;s strictures on sexual behavior</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.600" end="00:53:36.650" style="s2">and those would be the traditional ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.950" end="00:53:40.220" style="s2">and what you see on the left is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.650" end="00:53:44.630" style="s2">there&#39;s this weird paradoxical demand</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.220" end="00:53:46.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say that people should be allowed</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.630" end="00:53:51.020" style="s2">to express their sexuality in any manner</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.520" end="00:53:54.080" style="s2">that they choose whenever they want but</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.020" end="00:53:56.360" style="s2">that sex is so dangerous that it has to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.080" end="00:53:58.970" style="s2">be carefully regulated at every single</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.360" end="00:54:01.540" style="s2">stage of the interaction and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.970" end="00:54:04.190" style="s2">that many state legislatures have now</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.540" end="00:54:06.050" style="s2">followed the example of university</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.190" end="00:54:08.690" style="s2">campuses and put it in affirmative</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.050" end="00:54:11.690" style="s2">consent legislation so that every move</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.690" end="00:54:14.930" style="s2">you make towards physical intimacy has</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.690" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">to be preceded by the instantiation of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.930" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">verbal contract essentially it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:22.190" style="s2">well can I take your hand yes you</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:23.690" style="s2">actually from what I understand you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.190" end="00:54:26.690" style="s2">actually have to say yes</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.690" end="00:54:29.900" style="s2">like nodding is not sufficient and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.690" end="00:54:34.100" style="s2">and so each stage has to be it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.900" end="00:54:37.190" style="s2">preceded by affirmative consent and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.100" end="00:54:38.720" style="s2">know which which well I won&#39;t I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.190" end="00:54:41.690" style="s2">say anything about yeah I will it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.720" end="00:54:43.970" style="s2">absurd it&#39;s absurd to assume that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.690" end="00:54:47.060" style="s2">how human intimate relationships are</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.970" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">supposed to proceed and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.060" end="00:54:52.640" style="s2">complicated laws emerging that are part</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:54.860" style="s2">of that that for example this is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.640" end="00:54:56.690" style="s2">case in California as I understand it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.860" end="00:54:59.720" style="s2">that you cannot give affirmative consent</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.690" end="00:55:00.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re intoxicated okay so you think</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.720" end="00:55:04.850" style="s2">about that it&#39;s like well what does that</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.920" end="00:55:08.240" style="s2">mean it means that like a lot of sex</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.850" end="00:55:11.090" style="s2">Jesus has been illegal for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.240" end="00:55:13.520" style="s2">including marital marital yes it&#39;s nice</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.090" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">to me on my honeymoon okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.520" end="00:55:20.440" style="s2">well buddy I&#39;m rethinking it it seems it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:20.440" style="s2">seems to me it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.320" end="00:55:25.830" style="s2">it seems to me to mean the California</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.030" end="00:55:28.500" style="s2">legislation that if you have sex with</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.830" end="00:55:32.490" style="s2">your wife or husband and either of you</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.500" end="00:55:35.100" style="s2">is intoxicated then you&#39;re either one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.490" end="00:55:36.960" style="s2">you or both is guilty of rape that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.100" end="00:55:38.400" style="s2">what it looks like to me actually I was</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.960" end="00:55:40.520" style="s2">in a debate a few years ago at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.400" end="00:55:44.250" style="s2">University of Virginia law school and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.520" end="00:55:48.300" style="s2">turned to my debate partner and said so</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.250" end="00:55:51.210" style="s2">if what you&#39;re saying is right two</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.300" end="00:55:57.870" style="s2">people can rape one another hmm right</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.210" end="00:55:59.670" style="s2">she said yes and I said oh I mean how</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.870" end="00:56:01.650" style="s2">can that be well that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.670" end="00:56:03.990" style="s2">question well okay so then I would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.650" end="00:56:06.290" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting because I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.990" end="00:56:08.250" style="s2">that a lot of this confusion has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.290" end="00:56:10.560" style="s2">fundamentally as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.250" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">birth control pill so you know cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.560" end="00:56:14.130" style="s2">got to think situationally before you</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:17.190" style="s2">think ideologically or psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.130" end="00:56:19.080" style="s2">it&#39;s like it seems to me that the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.190" end="00:56:22.320" style="s2">century will be remembered for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.080" end="00:56:24.090" style="s2">hydrogen bomb the transistor and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.320" end="00:56:26.610" style="s2">birth control pill and those are</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.090" end="00:56:29.730" style="s2">unbelievably radical technological</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.610" end="00:56:33.750" style="s2">innovations and maybe the most yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.730" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">my fairly on the door it&#39;s dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.750" end="00:56:37.560" style="s2">the transistor you know cuz I spawned</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.210" style="s2">all of that so that that&#39;s the big</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.560" end="00:56:41.040" style="s2">technological innovation that spawned</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.210" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">all that and of the three I would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.040" end="00:56:46.200" style="s2">the the birth control pill is probably</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:48.930" style="s2">the bigger hydrogen bomb so and because</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.200" end="00:56:53.790" style="s2">it it changed the fundamental biological</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.930" end="00:56:55.820" style="s2">nature of women and men and because it</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.790" end="00:56:59.840" style="s2">gave women for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.820" end="00:57:03.120" style="s2">biological history the the option of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.840" end="00:57:05.010" style="s2">choosing their reproductive status yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.120" end="00:57:08.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s we like that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.010" end="00:57:10.460" style="s2">absol yes and no like yes we like it but</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.550" end="00:57:16.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not something that&#39;s come without a</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.460" end="00:57:18.990" style="s2">tremendous its complexity a fellow can</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.890" end="00:57:20.220" style="s2">have you been reading no no I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.990" end="00:57:23.460" style="s2">you&#39;ll find him interesting is easy</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.220" end="00:57:25.200" style="s2">right well I&#39;m not I&#39;m not making a case</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.460" end="00:57:26.250" style="s2">for the abolition of the birth control</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.200" end="00:57:28.770" style="s2">pill by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.250" end="00:57:31.650" style="s2">but I&#39;m pointing at its complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.770" end="00:57:33.360" style="s2">so because one of the questions is well</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.650" end="00:57:36.120" style="s2">once you can regulate your reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.360" end="00:57:37.200" style="s2">function what attitude should you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.120" end="00:57:41.220" style="s2">towards sex</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:43.410" style="s2">and one answer might be the more of it</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.220" end="00:57:45.990" style="s2">under the more varied circumstances the</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.410" end="00:57:48.420" style="s2">better because why not and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.990" end="00:57:50.250" style="s2">that was actually part of the attitude</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.420" end="00:57:52.290" style="s2">that emerged in the aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.250" end="00:57:55.410" style="s2">birth control pill in the 1960s right</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.290" end="00:57:56.940" style="s2">and it was it was a reasonable response</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.410" end="00:57:58.710" style="s2">in some sense because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.940" end="00:58:01.380" style="s2">cataclysmic change that you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.710" end="00:58:04.050" style="s2">what it implies well what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.380" end="00:58:06.660" style="s2">consequence of that well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.050" end="00:58:08.580" style="s2">people aren&#39;t reliable enough to use</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.660" end="00:58:11.490" style="s2">birth control in an entirely reliable</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.580" end="00:58:13.710" style="s2">manner so even though it can work at</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.490" end="00:58:15.390" style="s2">near 100% efficiency you have to take it</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.710" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">extraordinarily regularly and in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.390" end="00:58:20.610" style="s2">disciplined manner for that to work and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:23.250" style="s2">so there was still the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.610" end="00:58:24.240" style="s2">unwanted pregnancy let&#39;s say and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.250" end="00:58:27.510" style="s2">there was the problem of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.240" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">proliferation of sexual epidemics and</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.510" end="00:58:31.710" style="s2">that culminated in AIDS which you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:33.600" style="s2">could have easily wiped all of us out</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.710" end="00:58:34.740" style="s2">but didn&#39;t but there are other sexual</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.600" end="00:58:37.020" style="s2">epidemics that could have had the same</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.740" end="00:58:40.200" style="s2">effect but we&#39;ve been fortunate enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.020" end="00:58:44.360" style="s2">to escape them and and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.200" end="00:58:48.230" style="s2">more recently there&#39;s been this weird</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.360" end="00:58:50.730" style="s2">inversion especially on the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.230" end="00:58:52.580" style="s2">that points to the re-emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.730" end="00:58:56.040" style="s2">something like a set of sexual taboos</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.580" end="00:58:58.350" style="s2">you know like I think the idea that sex</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.040" end="00:59:00.180" style="s2">is casual and that it&#39;s a form of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.350" end="00:59:03.810" style="s2">entertainment is I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.180" end="00:59:07.620" style="s2">absolutely preposterous idea I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.810" end="00:59:11.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s psychologically shallow</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.620" end="00:59:14.600" style="s2">beyond belief to hold that as a core</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.600" end="00:59:18.090" style="s2">proposition because it forces you to</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.600" end="00:59:20.460" style="s2">first of all if it&#39;s repetitive sex with</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.090" end="00:59:22.170" style="s2">multiple partners it it forces you to</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.460" end="00:59:24.870" style="s2">treat people as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.170" end="00:59:26.730" style="s2">interchangeable and I don&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.870" end="00:59:27.960" style="s2">that&#39;s good for you psychologically or</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.730" end="00:59:33.300" style="s2">for the people that you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.960" end="00:59:37.350" style="s2">interchangeably it it implies that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.300" end="00:59:40.350" style="s2">can divorce sexuality from play from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.350" end="00:59:44.280" style="s2">desire for a relationship from emotional</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.350" end="00:59:46.320" style="s2">fragility from love from family from</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.280" end="00:59:46.950" style="s2">responsibility all of those things that</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.320" end="00:59:48.810" style="s2">are part</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.950" end="00:59:50.670" style="s2">of everyone and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.810" end="00:59:53.880" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think people&#39;s experience</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.670" end="00:59:56.700" style="s2">indicates that you can and especially on</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.880" end="00:59:59.130" style="s2">the emotional front and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.700" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">partly what&#39;s driving and there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.130" end="01:00:02.940" style="s2">residual sense that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:05.310" style="s2">about sex that&#39;s fundamentally dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.940" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s dangerous emotionally and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.310" end="01:00:09.089" style="s2">personally and maybe it&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:10.530" style="s2">socially and psychologically which it</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.089" end="01:00:12.780" style="s2">most certainly is because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.530" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">powerful force and the way the left is</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.780" end="01:00:18.450" style="s2">reacting to that is by insisting that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:20.849" style="s2">all forms of sexual behavior are valid</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.450" end="01:00:23.130" style="s2">and and and that it&#39;s reasonable to</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.849" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">manifest all of them but that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.130" end="01:00:26.369" style="s2">simultaneously so dangerous that</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.890" style="s2">absolutely every aspect of it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.369" end="01:00:31.560" style="s2">state regulated and in an increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.890" end="01:00:34.050" style="s2">draconian form and so I think what needs</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.560" end="01:00:35.940" style="s2">to happen is that the left and the right</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.050" end="01:00:37.560" style="s2">have to get together and have a like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.940" end="01:00:40.560" style="s2">real discussion about what constitutes</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.560" end="01:00:42.150" style="s2">fell in sexual morality and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.560" end="01:00:43.800" style="s2">conversation you have to have way before</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.150" end="01:00:45.660" style="s2">you worry about solving like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.800" end="01:00:48.000" style="s2">abortion debate which you know is very</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.660" end="01:00:49.589" style="s2">divisive and very and very intractable</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.000" end="01:00:51.510" style="s2">one of the things we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.589" end="01:00:53.400" style="s2">actually just last week on the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.510" end="01:00:55.980" style="s2">is this cover story in the Atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.400" end="01:00:58.470" style="s2">about the sexual recession among young</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.980" end="01:01:00.660" style="s2">people that despite the advent of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.470" end="01:01:04.920" style="s2">birth control pill abortion is is going</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.660" end="01:01:07.410" style="s2">down it&#39;s that there&#39;s a there&#39;s Lexus</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.920" end="01:01:10.380" style="s2">and I think is going down hook up fewer</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.410" end="01:01:12.810" style="s2">arms have you can&#39;t help into that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.380" end="01:01:14.430" style="s2">you&#39;re about in on that well if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.810" end="01:01:16.740" style="s2">raise the cost of something you decrease</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.430" end="01:01:19.710" style="s2">its prevalence you know and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.740" end="01:01:23.400" style="s2">that it&#39;s it seems to be you know a</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.710" end="01:01:25.380" style="s2">Juris now don&#39;t know why I kind of think</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.400" end="01:01:27.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s also a reflection of the same</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.380" end="01:01:29.400" style="s2">thing that bloomberg reported on just a</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.240" end="01:01:32.220" style="s2">few days ago they said that across</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.400" end="01:01:33.869" style="s2">businesses men are thinking I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.220" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">spending any time with a single woman</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.869" end="01:01:38.099" style="s2">that isn&#39;t you know associated with me</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.000" end="01:01:39.329" style="s2">in some formal manner like my wife I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.099" end="01:01:40.680" style="s2">not going to do it I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.329" end="01:01:41.880" style="s2">mentor young women I&#39;m not going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.680" end="01:01:43.349" style="s2">in a room alone with them because I</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.880" end="01:01:45.060" style="s2">could face career annihilation</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.349" end="01:01:47.310" style="s2">absolutely and instantly they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.060" end="01:01:49.020" style="s2">frightened of young women escape Julian</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.310" end="01:01:50.940" style="s2">said that&#39;s part of it but we can over</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.020" end="01:01:54.060" style="s2">exaggerate the part I mean anxiety and</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.940" end="01:01:56.400" style="s2">depression is going up amongst both</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.060" end="01:01:59.849" style="s2">young men and young women suicide is</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.400" end="01:02:01.020" style="s2">going up that that there&#39;s it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.849" end="01:02:03.540" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.020" end="01:02:06.450" style="s2">you know most people I think are not</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.540" end="01:02:08.220" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about an elite demographic</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.450" end="01:02:10.500" style="s2">who is into the consent and political</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.220" end="01:02:13.920" style="s2">correctness and work with their this is</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.500" end="01:02:16.290" style="s2">across the board and its global it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.920" end="01:02:18.540" style="s2">it&#39;s happening even in Sweden it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.290" end="01:02:21.000" style="s2">really happening in Japan yeah and Japan</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.540" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">exactly so so many things are and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.000" end="01:02:26.910" style="s2">speaks to and especially in Japan they</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:29.400" style="s2">have people especially young men have</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.910" end="01:02:31.740" style="s2">given up on intimacy and that having sex</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.400" end="01:02:32.310" style="s2">is actually I mean that had too much</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.740" end="01:02:36.210" style="s2">trouble</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.310" end="01:02:37.170" style="s2">sex robots right well right well and</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.210" end="01:02:39.630" style="s2">there&#39;s pornography</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.170" end="01:02:41.010" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s photography basically zero</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.630" end="01:02:44.220" style="s2">risk meters when you allow for</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.010" end="01:02:45.840" style="s2">pornography that that that men and women</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.220" end="01:02:48.240" style="s2">will sort of separate that from their</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.840" end="01:02:52.470" style="s2">actual sex anyway we&#39;re seeing a whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.240" end="01:02:54.690" style="s2">I guess collapse of intimacy let alone</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.470" end="01:02:56.910" style="s2">sex and and and and and I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.690" end="01:03:01.020" style="s2">that&#39;s just explained by the political</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.910" end="01:03:03.390" style="s2">nature so I I&#39;d be interested in your</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.020" end="01:03:05.220" style="s2">thoughts yeah well I don&#39;t know that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.390" end="01:03:07.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know the literature on the decline</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.220" end="01:03:10.530" style="s2">in sexual activity well enough to know</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.200" end="01:03:12.900" style="s2">if it&#39;s valid or reliable mhm but I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.530" end="01:03:14.609" style="s2">I mean I think that you know in a stable</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.900" end="01:03:17.340" style="s2">society you take lots of things for</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.609" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">granted you take you take the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.340" end="01:03:21.030" style="s2">men and women are going to be sexually</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:22.710" style="s2">attracted to one another for granted and</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.030" end="01:03:25.350" style="s2">even though it&#39;s more fragile than it</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.710" end="01:03:28.470" style="s2">appears you know it and it&#39;s suppressed</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.350" end="01:03:30.570" style="s2">more easily than you might think and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.470" end="01:03:32.490" style="s2">take the idea that men and women are</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.570" end="01:03:34.080" style="s2">going to move together towards the</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.490" end="01:03:36.210" style="s2">establishment of long-term intimate</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.080" end="01:03:38.190" style="s2">relationships for granted but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.210" end="01:03:40.920" style="s2">partly because you don&#39;t understand what</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.190" end="01:03:45.210" style="s2">invisible preconditions exist to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.920" end="01:03:47.010" style="s2">that self-evident you know and when</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.210" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">those invisible preconditions are</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.010" end="01:03:51.300" style="s2">disrupted by rapid technological or</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.300" end="01:03:55.710" style="s2">underneath you and you don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.710" end="01:03:57.690" style="s2">like a lot of it is traced to the advent</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.710" end="01:04:00.150" style="s2">of the smartphone especially in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.690" end="01:04:01.800" style="s2">Generation Z that that a Kate was</p>

<p begin="01:04:07.140" end="01:04:12.450" style="s2">increasing fall-off of relationships</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.770" end="01:04:13.470" style="s2">yeah well maybe the abstract is more</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.450" end="01:04:16.590" style="s2">interesting than right</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.470" end="01:04:18.180" style="s2">you see that good I just wanted I want</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.590" end="01:04:19.500" style="s2">to know the truth have you ever been</p>

<p begin="01:04:41.490" end="01:04:46.710" style="s2">they&#39;re very alluring they are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.650" end="01:04:48.390" style="s2">going together the preferred method of</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.390" end="01:04:52.080" style="s2">young people now is testing rather than</p>

<p begin="01:04:53.310" end="01:04:56.790" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s that&#39;s a whole that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.930" end="01:04:59.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a very interesting topic too that</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.790" end="01:05:01.470" style="s2">the like the tinder phenomenon that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.280" end="01:05:03.990" style="s2">because that that&#39;s an also a major</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.470" end="01:05:06.660" style="s2">technological revolution because what</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.990" end="01:05:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s done I would say for the first time</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.660" end="01:05:16.170" style="s2">is reduce the cost of rejection to males</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.090" end="01:05:17.460" style="s2">to zero because it hides it the only</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.170" end="01:05:18.990" style="s2">people you ever hear from our people who</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.460" end="01:05:21.570" style="s2">haven&#39;t rejected you although although</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.990" end="01:05:24.900" style="s2">they true but but there was one man who</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.570" end="01:05:27.900" style="s2">had to make 300 he key actually tallied</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.900" end="01:05:29.099" style="s2">it yeah he had to make 300 requests of</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.900" end="01:05:31.410" style="s2">swiping right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.099" end="01:05:33.450" style="s2">to one replies already he had the sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.410" end="01:05:36.390" style="s2">of sure sure sure but it&#39;s massively</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.450" end="01:05:38.490" style="s2">attenuated because you&#39;re not being</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.390" end="01:05:40.560" style="s2">humiliated not at all not at all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.490" end="01:05:42.300" style="s2">really it&#39;s really at arm&#39;s length and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.560" end="01:05:43.950" style="s2">you know you can swipe very very rapidly</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.300" end="01:05:48.390" style="s2">and so you can get all that rejection</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.950" end="01:05:50.940" style="s2">over within a very short period or less</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.390" end="01:05:54.630" style="s2">be worse not I mean not nearly as bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.940" end="01:05:57.960" style="s2">yeah so and you know I I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.630" end="01:05:59.339" style="s2">and I mean tinder also reduces the one</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.960" end="01:06:00.869" style="s2">of the other things that things that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.339" end="01:06:01.890" style="s2">want to think about with regards to sex</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.869" end="01:06:04.440" style="s2">and I think this is probably</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.890" end="01:06:06.270" style="s2">particularly true for women is that to</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.440" end="01:06:09.109" style="s2">what degree is it in women&#39;s interests</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.270" end="01:06:12.089" style="s2">to allow the cost of sex to fall to zero</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.109" end="01:06:14.160" style="s2">because with pornography certainly does</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.089" end="01:06:16.349" style="s2">that and it just seems to me that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.160" end="01:06:18.210" style="s2">not a very good long-term strategy for</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.349" end="01:06:20.220" style="s2">relationships between men and women</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.210" end="01:06:23.700" style="s2">because whatever sex is worth the cost</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.220" end="01:06:26.339" style="s2">of zero is the wrong price and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.700" end="01:06:27.000" style="s2">you know I bunnyranch and paid quite a</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.339" end="01:06:29.160" style="s2">bit for</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.000" end="01:06:31.590" style="s2">well true true but you but that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.160" end="01:06:33.960" style="s2">but you know you don&#39;t have to and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.590" end="01:06:36.470" style="s2">know I&#39;ve heard from a number of women</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.960" end="01:06:39.650" style="s2">what written read blog reports on their</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.470" end="01:06:42.570" style="s2">frustration with their attempts to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.650" end="01:06:44.310" style="s2">relatively sexually selective like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.570" end="01:06:47.430" style="s2">say they decide that they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.310" end="01:06:50.940" style="s2">to sleep with their new partner on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.430" end="01:06:52.380" style="s2">first date you know they&#39;re frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.940" end="01:06:54.540" style="s2">by the fact that to the degree that</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.380" end="01:06:57.180" style="s2">they&#39;re being cautious in their sexual</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.540" end="01:07:00.600" style="s2">behavior which i think is actually an</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.180" end="01:07:02.610" style="s2">admirable idea that they&#39;re instantly</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.600" end="01:07:04.770" style="s2">out competed especially if their</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.610" end="01:07:06.270" style="s2">partners are somewhat impulsive by women</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.770" end="01:07:11.010" style="s2">who will say yes at the drop of a hat</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.270" end="01:07:12.870" style="s2">and so well again I don&#39;t think you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.010" end="01:07:15.270" style="s2">it depends on what the goal is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.870" end="01:07:16.830" style="s2">the thing is that there&#39;s the short</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.270" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">terms their short-term sexual</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.830" end="01:07:20.070" style="s2">gratification but the literature</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:21.870" style="s2">indicates that married couples for</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.070" end="01:07:23.970" style="s2">example or couples in a permanent</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.870" end="01:07:25.680" style="s2">long-term monogamous relationship are</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.970" end="01:07:27.780" style="s2">more sexually satisfied than single</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.680" end="01:07:29.190" style="s2">people and maybe the single people have</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.780" end="01:07:31.560" style="s2">to be parsed out into those who are</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.190" end="01:07:34.410" style="s2">sexually successful and those who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.560" end="01:07:37.820" style="s2">but I suspect that wouldn&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.410" end="01:07:40.410" style="s2">much difference but whatever there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.820" end="01:07:42.060" style="s2">utility of relatively immediate sexual</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.410" end="01:07:43.620" style="s2">gratification for whatever that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.060" end="01:07:46.230" style="s2">and the adventurousness that goes along</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.620" end="01:07:47.880" style="s2">with that let&#39;s say the hunt and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.230" end="01:07:49.590" style="s2">excitement of having a new partner and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.880" end="01:07:51.060" style="s2">all of that and maybe even the danger</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.590" end="01:07:52.710" style="s2">that&#39;s associated with that because</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.060" end="01:07:55.500" style="s2">people like to have a little bit of</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.710" end="01:07:57.740" style="s2">danger in their life but what&#39;s the goal</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.500" end="01:07:59.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like what do people want and I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.740" end="01:08:01.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a great book called a billion</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.940" end="01:08:03.330" style="s2">wicked thoughts that was written by</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.620" end="01:08:05.250" style="s2">Google engineers and so it contains</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.330" end="01:08:06.750" style="s2">great psychology because Google</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.250" end="01:08:07.860" style="s2">engineers don&#39;t care about political</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.750" end="01:08:09.420" style="s2">correctness and they just write down</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.860" end="01:08:11.310" style="s2">what they find and they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.420" end="01:08:14.700" style="s2">notice that it&#39;s politically incorrect</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.310" end="01:08:16.620" style="s2">hence James tomb or for example and what</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.700" end="01:08:19.080" style="s2">they found was that women use</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.620" end="01:08:21.029" style="s2">pornography just as much as men but the</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.080" end="01:08:24.150" style="s2">pornography that women use is verbal</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.029" end="01:08:27.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not imagistic and that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.150" end="01:08:29.160" style="s2">pornographic novels essentially follow</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.060" end="01:08:31.740" style="s2">the same extraordinarily standard</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.160" end="01:08:33.630" style="s2">plotline to the degree that publishing</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.740" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">houses like Harlequin which I was going</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.630" end="01:08:37.350" style="s2">to say it&#39;s the it&#39;s the bodice rippers</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:39.020" style="s2">that&#39;s right snob yeah right so in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.350" end="01:08:41.029" style="s2">Harlequin series you have you know the</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.020" end="01:08:45.069" style="s2">that were published like in the 1970s</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.029" end="01:08:48.080" style="s2">that are pretty they&#39;re tame well</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.069" end="01:08:50.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a variety they range from they</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.080" end="01:08:52.490" style="s2">range from mpletely tame to essentially</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.359" end="01:08:55.150" style="s2">to hardcore pornography but the but the</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.490" end="01:08:58.279" style="s2">plots are quite similar and the plot is</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.150" end="01:09:01.069" style="s2">you know young relatively innocent woman</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.279" end="01:09:04.270" style="s2">finds powerful interesting dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.069" end="01:09:07.839" style="s2">male tames him and then they live happy</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.270" end="01:09:10.160" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s the beauty in the beasts plot</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.839" end="01:09:12.490" style="s2">search for women on pornhub we</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.160" end="01:09:15.080" style="s2">discovered we did an episode on porn was</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.490" end="01:09:17.930" style="s2">for women it was getting rape wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.080" end="01:09:19.220" style="s2">that like there&#39;s no lesbianism or at</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.930" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">least that was your port yeah that was</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.220" end="01:09:26.750" style="s2">yours on me okay my port is going to the</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:34.310" style="s2">williams-sonoma store I know it is it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.750" end="01:09:36.310" style="s2">female all those men and women should</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.310" end="01:09:40.100" style="s2">never tell one another their fantasies</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.310" end="01:09:42.410" style="s2">because when they&#39;re outraged by what we</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.100" end="01:09:44.600" style="s2">say and we&#39;re totally bored by what they</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.410" end="01:09:47.060" style="s2">say and I thought like women have kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.600" end="01:09:48.470" style="s2">of these scenarios and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.060" end="01:09:51.620" style="s2">know you know I don&#39;t know what their</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.470" end="01:09:54.170" style="s2">storylines storylines and matters like I</p>

<p begin="01:09:54.170" end="01:09:58.580" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of just close-ups of</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.540" end="01:10:00.620" style="s2">female body parts yeah well men are much</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.580" end="01:10:02.090" style="s2">more visually oriented I know sexually</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.770" end="01:10:19.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m worried that now sort of the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.980" end="01:10:22.100" style="s2">in the past sexual sub you know gays</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.490" end="01:10:24.140" style="s2">were shamed we&#39;re now reversing it and</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.100" end="01:10:26.540" style="s2">shaming like heterosexual</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.140" end="01:10:27.770" style="s2">yes--that&#39;s differ we had the young</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.540" end="01:10:29.150" style="s2">woman who complained about being</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.690" end="01:10:37.580" style="s2">time for a couple more topics with you</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.840" end="01:10:39.140" style="s2">because one of the things that is coming</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.580" end="01:10:40.460" style="s2">out of this younger generation and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.140" end="01:10:42.170" style="s2">have a chapter of it in your book which</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.460" end="01:10:44.030" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry I wanted to finish what the</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.170" end="01:10:46.610" style="s2">line that we were pursuing I do this</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.030" end="01:10:48.650" style="s2">well with sexual behavior the question</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.610" end="01:10:50.210" style="s2">is what&#39;s the endgame and then this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.650" end="01:10:52.810" style="s2">what people have to ask themselves is</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.210" end="01:10:55.420" style="s2">like one of the coral</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.810" end="01:10:57.190" style="s2">to the female pornographic romance is</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.420" end="01:10:59.380" style="s2">actually the establishment of a</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.190" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">long-term relationship and the question</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.380" end="01:11:04.200" style="s2">is you know it&#39;s so funny because I got</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:06.730" style="s2">pilloried in the New York Times for</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.200" end="01:11:09.970" style="s2">talking about enforced monogamy</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.730" end="01:11:13.510" style="s2">squirty because that gets brought up</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.970" end="01:11:15.790" style="s2">like in everyone I talked to that woman</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.510" end="01:11:17.710" style="s2">for two days I know it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.790" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">little side comment and then that became</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.710" end="01:11:22.720" style="s2">like a showcase like like in forced</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:24.940" style="s2">monogamy you mean forced marriage no I</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.720" end="01:11:26.800" style="s2">mean that was an anthropological term</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.940" end="01:11:29.470" style="s2">what she knew perfectly well because</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.800" end="01:11:31.000" style="s2">she&#39;s a very smart person and all it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.470" end="01:11:33.310" style="s2">means is that there&#39;s a pronounced</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.000" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">proclivity in human societies around the</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.310" end="01:11:38.110" style="s2">world to enforce monogamous</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:39.760" style="s2">relationships at multiple levels of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.110" end="01:11:41.470" style="s2">sociological hierarchy you do it</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:43.600" style="s2">culturally you do it you do it in</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.470" end="01:11:46.450" style="s2">expectation you do it legally you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.600" end="01:11:48.340" style="s2">an enforced monogamy so if my son was</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.450" end="01:11:50.020" style="s2">just married and if he came to me next</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.340" end="01:11:51.490" style="s2">year and he said you know okay dad guess</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.020" end="01:11:53.770" style="s2">what I&#39;ve managed to have four Affairs</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.490" end="01:11:55.690" style="s2">in the last year with heart women and my</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.770" end="01:11:57.700" style="s2">wife hasn&#39;t found out about any of them</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.690" end="01:12:00.430" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to pat him on the back and</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.700" end="01:12:01.810" style="s2">say good job kid you know I&#39;m gonna say</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.430" end="01:12:03.730" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s up with you you know you</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.810" end="01:12:05.230" style="s2">violated the vow that you took you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.730" end="01:12:06.820" style="s2">putting your whole future risk you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.230" end="01:12:08.950" style="s2">betraying yourself and your wife and</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.820" end="01:12:11.950" style="s2">well that&#39;s enforced monogamy you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.950" end="01:12:13.270" style="s2">the the idea is that the social norm is</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.950" end="01:12:14.980" style="s2">the establishment of a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.270" end="01:12:18.040" style="s2">monogamous relationship and that there</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.980" end="01:12:20.530" style="s2">are strictures put in place to support</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.040" end="01:12:22.900" style="s2">that but also to punish deviation from</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.530" end="01:12:25.240" style="s2">it and you say well you know maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.900" end="01:12:26.920" style="s2">not so much on the punishment in but you</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.240" end="01:12:28.900" style="s2">can it depends it&#39;s like what do you</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.920" end="01:12:31.180" style="s2">want what what is it that you want you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.900" end="01:12:33.490" style="s2">want a long-term stable relationship or</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.180" end="01:12:35.230" style="s2">not and if that&#39;s the goal then your</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.490" end="01:12:37.630" style="s2">behavior should be devoted to whatever</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.230" end="01:12:39.580" style="s2">it is that facilitates that goal and I</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.630" end="01:12:42.250" style="s2">don&#39;t see that I certainly don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.580" end="01:12:44.950" style="s2">that casual and impulsive sex fits that</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.250" end="01:12:47.260" style="s2">bill now not in the least and all of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.950" end="01:12:49.810" style="s2">evidence with regards to living together</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.260" end="01:12:51.160" style="s2">shows that that&#39;s actually detrimental</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.810" end="01:12:54.160" style="s2">to the establishment of a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.160" end="01:12:55.840" style="s2">relationship so first of all common-law</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.160" end="01:12:57.220" style="s2">marriage people who are in common-law</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.840" end="01:12:59.860" style="s2">marriage are much more likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.220" end="01:13:01.750" style="s2">divorced so that&#39;s the first thing the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.860" end="01:13:03.460" style="s2">second thing is people who live together</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.750" end="01:13:05.200" style="s2">before they get married are much more</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.460" end="01:13:06.250" style="s2">likely to be divorced after they get</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.200" end="01:13:08.080" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.250" end="01:13:09.850" style="s2">the idea that well you can try someone</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.080" end="01:13:10.930" style="s2">on for size and see how it works and</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.850" end="01:13:13.060" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna see if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.930" end="01:13:15.430" style="s2">compatible it&#39;s like that&#39;s one story</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.060" end="01:13:17.290" style="s2">another story is how about you and I</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.430" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">live together for a little while and you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.290" end="01:13:21.730" style="s2">know if you&#39;re you&#39;re not so bad but</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:23.140" style="s2">maybe I can find someone better and if I</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.730" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">do you know in the next year and a half</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.140" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">or so because we&#39;re not hooked together</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:28.960" style="s2">in any formal way I can just trade you</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:31.450" style="s2">in it&#39;s okay you can do the same to me</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.960" end="01:13:34.270" style="s2">but I don&#39;t really see that as the sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.450" end="01:13:36.310" style="s2">of complimentary mutual interaction that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.270" end="01:13:38.740" style="s2">leads to the formulation of long term</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.310" end="01:13:40.930" style="s2">trust and I think it&#39;s a better story</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.740" end="01:13:42.460" style="s2">for interpreting what constitutes living</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.930" end="01:13:44.170" style="s2">together then well you know we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.460" end="01:13:47.650" style="s2">try each other out because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.170" end="01:13:50.380" style="s2">mature people would do rental yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.650" end="01:13:52.030" style="s2">that&#39;s right wash the rental yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.380" end="01:13:54.130" style="s2">well that&#39;s that&#39;s it and and and but</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.030" end="01:13:56.320" style="s2">what more most importantly the data</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.130" end="01:13:57.880" style="s2">indicate that it doesn&#39;t work is that</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.320" end="01:13:59.650" style="s2">you&#39;re more likely to get divorced not</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.880" end="01:14:02.050" style="s2">less likely because maybe the right</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.650" end="01:14:04.090" style="s2">attitude is well you&#39;re probably about</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.050" end="01:14:05.950" style="s2">as flawed as me and you know we&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.090" end="01:14:07.990" style="s2">that we found each other and so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.950" end="01:14:09.760" style="s2">see if we can make a commitment because</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.990" end="01:14:11.560" style="s2">we&#39;re engaging in something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.760" end="01:14:13.420" style="s2">risky you know an intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.560" end="01:14:14.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna commit to each other and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.420" end="01:14:17.650" style="s2">see if we can build something of value</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.920" end="01:14:19.270" style="s2">across time and there&#39;s a definite of</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.650" end="01:14:21.010" style="s2">risk in that but there&#39;s a complement to</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.270" end="01:14:23.710" style="s2">your partner it&#39;s like well I think</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.010" end="01:14:25.930" style="s2">you&#39;re worth making a sacrifice for and</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.710" end="01:14:28.690" style="s2">what&#39;s the sacrifice well it&#39;s everyone</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.930" end="01:14:29.980" style="s2">else it&#39;s a big sacrifice and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.690" end="01:14:32.230" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t see that as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.980" end="01:14:34.210" style="s2">compliment then I don&#39;t think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.230" end="01:14:35.350" style="s2">thinking because not only is it a</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.210" end="01:14:37.420" style="s2">compliment it&#39;s sort of like the</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.350" end="01:14:39.520" style="s2">ultimate compliment and maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.420" end="01:14:41.410" style="s2">get to have a marriage that works</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.520" end="01:14:43.720" style="s2">without that compliment maybe it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.410" end="01:14:45.580" style="s2">difficult to establish a long-term</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.720" end="01:14:47.830" style="s2">relationship that&#39;s functional that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.580" end="01:14:49.900" style="s2">have to make a walloping sacrifice very</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.830" end="01:14:52.090" style="s2">early on in the relationship in order</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.900" end="01:14:53.740" style="s2">for that to even be a possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.090" end="01:14:55.210" style="s2">you know maybe not because what the hell</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.740" end="01:14:57.910" style="s2">do we know about what binds people</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.210" end="01:14:59.740" style="s2">together but but it&#39;s not that easy to</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.910" end="01:15:02.320" style="s2">stay with someone for a long period of</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.740" end="01:15:03.940" style="s2">time you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a real it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.320" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">real commitment it takes a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.940" end="01:15:08.230" style="s2">amount of effort so yes it that actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:11.590" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing us back to the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.230" end="01:15:13.990" style="s2">and your time with Tammy and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.590" end="01:15:15.790" style="s2">things about I think I&#39;m gonna guess</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.990" end="01:15:18.100" style="s2">this is a bit of an overlooked part in</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.790" end="01:15:19.929" style="s2">your chapter in your book but I just was</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.100" end="01:15:22.030" style="s2">like one of my favorites it</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.929" end="01:15:23.769" style="s2">was your book on modern parenting oh yes</p>

<p begin="01:15:23.769" end="01:15:28.269" style="s2">get most trouble for I know but critics</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.860" end="01:15:30.760" style="s2">don&#39;t read that far into the book well</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.269" end="01:15:33.999" style="s2">well it my mother when I had my first</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.760" end="01:15:36.789" style="s2">child gave me a 1950s copy of dr. Spock</p>

<p begin="01:15:36.789" end="01:15:40.479" style="s2">and yet he was just like the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.110" end="01:15:42.489" style="s2">sensible person made new children very</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.479" end="01:15:45.039" style="s2">very well was a pediatrician and you</p>

<p begin="01:16:01.780" end="01:16:06.760" style="s2">we&#39;re producing maybe some of these kids</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.059" end="01:16:10.630" style="s2">who are prolonging adulthood prolonging</p>

<p begin="01:16:23.139" end="01:16:26.380" style="s2">then you told some hilarious stories</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.119" end="01:16:28.719" style="s2">about when your wife ran a daycare</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.380" end="01:16:30.489" style="s2">center out of your house and you would</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.719" end="01:16:34.900" style="s2">you would get into tests of wills with</p>

<p begin="01:16:40.510" end="01:16:43.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t want to do yeah he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.709" end="01:16:46.030" style="s2">charming yeah and very emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.630" end="01:16:47.619" style="s2">stable so it&#39;s like he&#39;s easy to get</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.030" end="01:16:48.849" style="s2">along with but trying to get him to do</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.619" end="01:16:49.269" style="s2">something he doesn&#39;t want to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.849" end="01:16:51.039" style="s2">alright</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.269" end="01:16:53.139" style="s2">he had my wife defeated when he was nine</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.039" end="01:16:55.689" style="s2">months old and she&#39;s tough like it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.139" end="01:16:57.189" style="s2">seriously she&#39;s no pushover but he would</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.689" end="01:16:59.260" style="s2">just sit there with his mouth closed and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.189" end="01:17:01.689" style="s2">glare at hers like I&#39;m not eating that</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.260" end="01:17:03.820" style="s2">and I can take more than you can dish</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.689" end="01:17:05.409" style="s2">out it was really something to see you</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.820" end="01:17:09.610" style="s2">know to see that kind of force of will</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.409" end="01:17:11.590" style="s2">in someone not small talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.610" end="01:17:13.389" style="s2">about that and just the modern roles</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.590" end="01:17:15.400" style="s2">between men and women I mean we&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.389" end="01:17:16.900" style="s2">you know they&#39;re you don&#39;t really you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.400" end="01:17:18.820" style="s2">not really supposed to distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.900" end="01:17:21.119" style="s2">between fathers and mothers even though</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.820" end="01:17:23.320" style="s2">that seems to inevitably happen in most</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.119" end="01:17:25.030" style="s2">well it happens in large part because</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.320" end="01:17:26.829" style="s2">the children differentiate between them</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.030" end="01:17:28.059" style="s2">like parents are under the delusion that</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.829" end="01:17:30.189" style="s2">most of what you do with your children</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.059" end="01:17:32.079" style="s2">is driven by what you want to do with</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.189" end="01:17:33.300" style="s2">your children when in fact it&#39;s driven</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.079" end="01:17:35.370" style="s2">to a massive due</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.300" end="01:17:37.800" style="s2">by what your children want you to do</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.370" end="01:17:42.120" style="s2">with them and so there were studies done</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.800" end="01:17:43.650" style="s2">thirty years ago on feminist parents who</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.120" end="01:17:45.120" style="s2">decided that they were going to raise</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.650" end="01:17:46.680" style="s2">their children in non gender</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.120" end="01:17:48.450" style="s2">differentiated manners and when they</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.680" end="01:17:50.940" style="s2">were studied they found that the parents</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.450" end="01:17:53.160" style="s2">who had that explicit philosophy were</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.940" end="01:17:54.690" style="s2">just as gender differentiated with their</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.160" end="01:17:56.010" style="s2">children as the parents who didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.690" end="01:17:58.170" style="s2">the philosophy and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.010" end="01:18:01.620" style="s2">is that if you&#39;re a parent that has any</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.170" end="01:18:03.900" style="s2">sense at all you don&#39;t respond to your</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.620" end="01:18:05.820" style="s2">children as a rigid ideologue you</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.900" end="01:18:09.390" style="s2">respond to them as whatever it is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.820" end="01:18:11.370" style="s2">child man manifests it him or herself as</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.390" end="01:18:14.250" style="s2">like you know with any individualized</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.370" end="01:18:16.290" style="s2">relationship you take your cue from the</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.250" end="01:18:18.600" style="s2">person and you might think while a child</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.290" end="01:18:20.220" style="s2">has no intrinsic nature but you know if</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.600" end="01:18:23.130" style="s2">you think that you either don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.220" end="01:18:25.920" style="s2">children or you&#39;ve never seen a child or</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.130" end="01:18:27.450" style="s2">you&#39;re so blinded by your Radiology that</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.920" end="01:18:29.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a child you just have a</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.450" end="01:18:31.980" style="s2">blank projection screen onto which you</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.970" end="01:18:35.730" style="s2">project your presuppositions and then</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.980" end="01:18:37.440" style="s2">heaven help your child you know so so a</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.730" end="01:18:38.760" style="s2">lot of the gender differentiation is</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.440" end="01:18:40.890" style="s2">actually driven by the children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.760" end="01:18:43.590" style="s2">demands and and that&#39;s all for the good</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.890" end="01:18:45.000" style="s2">that chapter I thought I would get into</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.590" end="01:18:46.950" style="s2">tremendous trouble for writing that</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.000" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">chapter because it&#39;s contentious right</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.950" end="01:18:51.480" style="s2">on the surface this the rule because the</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:53.670" style="s2">rule first implies that children can be</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.480" end="01:18:55.560" style="s2">dislikable and then I would say again</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.670" end="01:18:57.690" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like have you met children</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.560" end="01:19:00.180" style="s2">exactly a child where they&#39;re children</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.690" end="01:19:01.860" style="s2">you didn&#39;t like obviously and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.180" end="01:19:03.660" style="s2">lots of children are dislikeable but</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.860" end="01:19:05.280" style="s2">it&#39;s taboo to admit that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.660" end="01:19:07.560" style="s2">all sweetness and light and innocence</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.280" end="01:19:09.540" style="s2">ever since Rousseau but you know who so</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.560" end="01:19:12.120" style="s2">put all five of his children in an</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.540" end="01:19:14.280" style="s2">orphanage where they all died so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.120" end="01:19:18.780" style="s2">we won&#39;t know so we won&#39;t talk too much</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.280" end="01:19:20.760" style="s2">about Rousseau and and then the next</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.780" end="01:19:22.680" style="s2">taboo is well that parents can dislike</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.760" end="01:19:24.720" style="s2">their children but if you&#39;re a clinician</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.680" end="01:19:27.060" style="s2">and you don&#39;t think that parents can</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.720" end="01:19:29.250" style="s2">dislike their children then well then</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.060" end="01:19:31.380" style="s2">well then you&#39;re not a clinician because</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.250" end="01:19:34.830" style="s2">one of the things you constantly see is</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.380" end="01:19:37.760" style="s2">that pathology within families is an</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.830" end="01:19:40.350" style="s2">incredibly common source of</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.760" end="01:19:42.480" style="s2">psychological destabilization right and</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.350" end="01:19:43.790" style="s2">it&#39;s terrible tension between parents</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.480" end="01:19:46.829" style="s2">and their children and between siblings</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.790" end="01:19:49.949" style="s2">what I suggest in the in the book which</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.829" end="01:19:53.399" style="s2">I think is radical by today&#39;s standards</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.949" end="01:19:56.639" style="s2">is that your fundamental job as a parent</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.399" end="01:20:00.209" style="s2">is to ensure that by the time your child</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.639" end="01:20:02.339" style="s2">is 4 years old that they are maximally</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.209" end="01:20:04.800" style="s2">desirable to other children and two</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.339" end="01:20:07.169" style="s2">adults because what happens is that</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.800" end="01:20:09.209" style="s2">after the age of four</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.169" end="01:20:11.909" style="s2">you aren&#39;t the primary agent of</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.209" end="01:20:13.349" style="s2">socialization if the social world</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.909" end="01:20:15.539" style="s2">becomes the primary agent of</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.349" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">socialization and if your child is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.539" end="01:20:20.789" style="s2">sort of child that&#39;s invited to play by</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:22.949" style="s2">other children because your child is</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.789" end="01:20:25.229" style="s2">capable of four strolling gratification</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.949" end="01:20:27.510" style="s2">and taking turns and playing someone</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.229" end="01:20:29.399" style="s2">else&#39;s game when when it&#39;s necessary and</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.510" end="01:20:31.499" style="s2">abiding by the rules and not having a</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.399" end="01:20:34.949" style="s2">temper tantrum when they lose and not</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.499" end="01:20:37.109" style="s2">getting to you know high on their horse</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.949" end="01:20:46.260" style="s2">when they win then many children will</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.109" end="01:20:48.419" style="s2">invite them no III know we have we have</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.260" end="01:20:54.300" style="s2">our limited time and so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.419" end="01:20:55.559" style="s2">I was actually say any more question</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.300" end="01:20:57.899" style="s2">because I really want to hear you talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.559" end="01:21:00.059" style="s2">well oh I know I just want to let it all</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.899" end="01:21:04.169" style="s2">take 15 seconds to wrap that up in this</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.059" end="01:21:05.969" style="s2">well so look you get married when you</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.169" end="01:21:07.439" style="s2">have your children and you&#39;re flawed and</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.969" end="01:21:08.879" style="s2">your partner&#39;s flawed and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.439" end="01:21:10.379" style="s2">you&#39;re flawed in different ways and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.879" end="01:21:13.499" style="s2">you put the two of you together and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.379" end="01:21:16.499" style="s2">make one approximately normal person and</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.499" end="01:21:18.899" style="s2">then hopefully and then your child has</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.499" end="01:21:21.389" style="s2">to interact with that dyad that is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.899" end="01:21:24.300" style="s2">reasonable representative of social</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.389" end="01:21:26.879" style="s2">norms and if they discipline if your</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.300" end="01:21:29.039" style="s2">child disappoints you with their</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.879" end="01:21:31.229" style="s2">behavior the probability that they will</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.039" end="01:21:33.989" style="s2">disappoint other people is very high and</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.229" end="01:21:36.689" style="s2">so you have an ethical obligation to</p>

<p begin="01:24:15.960" end="01:24:23.850" style="s2">cursed with some two years I won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.420" end="01:24:26.030" style="s2">which one was two years old and had he</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.850" end="01:24:28.739" style="s2">was a good boy but he had an insane</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.030" end="01:24:29.190" style="s2">meltdown in a supermarket I was with my</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.739" end="01:24:34.170" style="s2">mother</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.190" end="01:24:37.890" style="s2">we both pretended we didn&#39;t know oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.170" end="01:24:39.450" style="s2">oh yeah we heard people say oh my god Oh</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.890" end="01:24:41.700" style="s2">haven&#39;t watching a two-year-old have a</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.450" end="01:24:44.070" style="s2">tantrum is it so it was very like I</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.700" end="01:24:45.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to be a we had a boy who</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.070" end="01:24:47.850" style="s2">used to be in like when my wife was</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.750" end="01:24:50.040" style="s2">taking care of more kids than ours there</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.850" end="01:24:53.010" style="s2">was a little boy who had learned to</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.040" end="01:24:54.840" style="s2">throw a pretty decent tab yes and and he</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.010" end="01:24:56.640" style="s2">would do that and it didn&#39;t work in our</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.840" end="01:24:58.230" style="s2">house because we just leave him have his</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.640" end="01:24:59.880" style="s2">tantrum and going into a different room</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.230" end="01:25:01.380" style="s2">and then he&#39;d kind of wake up out of it</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.880" end="01:25:03.270" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be anybody around and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.380" end="01:25:05.370" style="s2">that like if you put all that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.270" end="01:25:06.900" style="s2">in dramatic display and you had zero</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.370" end="01:25:09.180" style="s2">audience it&#39;s not you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.900" end="01:25:12.870" style="s2">sustain it anyways he could actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.180" end="01:25:14.310" style="s2">hold his breath until he turned blue so</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.870" end="01:25:15.210" style="s2">you should try that you go home and see</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.310" end="01:25:18.120" style="s2">if you can do that in front of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.210" end="01:25:19.260" style="s2">mirror man like it&#39;s hard it&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.120" end="01:25:21.330" style="s2">dire</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.260" end="01:25:23.160" style="s2">will you do it was impressive it was and</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.330" end="01:25:24.989" style="s2">and you know two-year-olds are very</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.160" end="01:25:27.300" style="s2">impressive they&#39;re there they have</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.989" end="01:25:29.820" style="s2">unbelievable outbursts of rage and and</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.300" end="01:25:31.500" style="s2">disinhibited emotion and your job is you</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.820" end="01:25:34.020" style="s2">know they&#39;re they&#39;re driven by these</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.500" end="01:25:36.030" style="s2">underlying motivational systems that are</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.020" end="01:25:37.950" style="s2">unbelievably powerful and it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.030" end="01:25:39.989" style="s2">what makes them delightful because when</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.950" end="01:25:41.760" style="s2">they&#39;re happy they&#39;re insanely happy and</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.989" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">when they&#39;re playful they&#39;re incredibly</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.760" end="01:25:46.680" style="s2">playful and so the positive end of them</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.920" end="01:25:48.870" style="s2">is is way exaggerated compared to you</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.680" end="01:25:50.100" style="s2">know a rather drab adult and and so it</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.870" end="01:25:52.680" style="s2">makes two-year-olds extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.100" end="01:25:54.330" style="s2">interesting but the same is true on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.680" end="01:25:56.100" style="s2">negative emotion side they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.330" end="01:25:58.230" style="s2">dysregulated and it&#39;s really hard on</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.100" end="01:26:00.030" style="s2">them like to have a two-year-old who</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.230" end="01:26:02.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t in control of their emotions means</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.030" end="01:26:04.860" style="s2">that you have a child who&#39;s developing</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.420" end="01:26:06.870" style="s2">central personality you know their their</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.860" end="01:26:08.969" style="s2">ego for black of a better word is</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.870" end="01:26:10.950" style="s2">constantly being swamped by these</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.969" end="01:26:12.540" style="s2">powerful underlying emotional systems</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.950" end="01:26:14.820" style="s2">you know what it&#39;s like if you are</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.540" end="01:26:16.560" style="s2">enraged for any period of time or if</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.820" end="01:26:19.560" style="s2">you&#39;re engulfed by grief like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:21.300" style="s2">exhausting it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s demeaning and</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.560" end="01:26:22.920" style="s2">it&#39;s exhausting and it&#39;s the same with a</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.300" end="01:26:25.969" style="s2">little candidates like it&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.920" end="01:26:27.210" style="s2">defeat for the developing integrated</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.969" end="01:26:29.370" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.210" end="01:26:33.000" style="s2">to be subjugated by those catastrophic</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.370" end="01:26:35.120" style="s2">ly powerful emergent emotions and part</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.000" end="01:26:38.160" style="s2">of your job as a parent is to scaffold</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.120" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">the part of the child that can regulate</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.160" end="01:26:42.630" style="s2">and inhibit those powerful underlying</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:45.300" style="s2">systems so with my son for example when</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.630" end="01:26:46.560" style="s2">he used to misbehave I would count and</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.300" end="01:26:49.440" style="s2">say you&#39;re gonna go sit on the steps</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.560" end="01:26:50.700" style="s2">he&#39;d say oh no I&#39;m not I would say oh</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.440" end="01:26:52.350" style="s2">yes you are</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.700" end="01:26:54.000" style="s2">and then usually I&#39;d have to chase him</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.350" end="01:26:55.440" style="s2">around because he wouldn&#39;t go sit on the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.000" end="01:26:57.330" style="s2">steps and so I&#39;d put him on the steps</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.440" end="01:26:58.860" style="s2">say you&#39;re gonna sit there until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.330" end="01:27:02.190" style="s2">got yourself under control</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.860" end="01:27:03.600" style="s2">and so he&#39;d say no I not say yes you are</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.190" end="01:27:05.670" style="s2">and then he tried to get up and I just</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.600" end="01:27:08.070" style="s2">told him say you&#39;re gonna sit there I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.670" end="01:27:10.710" style="s2">gonna hold you till you sit there no or</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.070" end="01:27:13.350" style="s2">not it&#39;s like I could no wait a</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.710" end="01:27:14.640" style="s2">two-year-old so I usually won those</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.350" end="01:27:16.500" style="s2">battles and then he&#39;d sit there I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.640" end="01:27:17.910" style="s2">look kid this is the deal I&#39;d say two</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.500" end="01:27:19.350" style="s2">things like you won&#39;t have a bad day or</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.910" end="01:27:20.400" style="s2">you won&#39;t have a good day you think</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.350" end="01:27:25.050" style="s2">about that because if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.400" end="01:27:26.850" style="s2">good day a bad day we could have a bad</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.050" end="01:27:29.100" style="s2">days you sit here as soon as you can</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.850" end="01:27:30.840" style="s2">controlling yourself and you ready to be</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.100" end="01:27:31.830" style="s2">civilized then you can come back and we</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.840" end="01:27:36.030" style="s2">can have a good day</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.830" end="01:27:38.670" style="s2">so we&#39;d sit there just just I was</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.030" end="01:27:41.340" style="s2">unbelievable to watch just enveloped</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.670" end="01:27:43.050" style="s2">with rage you know just trying to get</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.340" end="01:27:44.670" style="s2">himself under control you know and so</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.050" end="01:27:48.060" style="s2">I&#39;d come back thirty seconds later and</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.670" end="01:27:51.890" style="s2">I&#39;d say you know what good got yourself</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.060" end="01:27:54.690" style="s2">caught your act together you know yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.890" end="01:27:56.790" style="s2">so then I wait and usually it took him</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.690" end="01:27:57.960" style="s2">two or three minutes and he&#39;d calm down</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.790" end="01:28:00.150" style="s2">and then he&#39;d come back out and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.960" end="01:28:01.530" style="s2">say I&#39;m ready to have a good day and he</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.150" end="01:28:03.810" style="s2">meant it you know and I could tell he</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.530" end="01:28:06.300" style="s2">meant it too because whatever resentment</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.810" end="01:28:08.550" style="s2">I was harboring towards him for his</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.300" end="01:28:10.080" style="s2">misbehavior and you have to watch that</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.550" end="01:28:13.260" style="s2">when you&#39;re an adult would vanish</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.080" end="01:28:15.480" style="s2">because he&#39;d come and he he was done he</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.260" end="01:28:17.550" style="s2">was ready just you know to proceed on a</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.480" end="01:28:19.680" style="s2">civilized basis it was really</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.550" end="01:28:22.530" style="s2">interesting to watch that because it</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.680" end="01:28:24.150" style="s2">took him every time he sat on the steps</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.530" end="01:28:25.920" style="s2">it took him a shorter and shorter period</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.150" end="01:28:28.140" style="s2">of time to attain mastery right until</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.920" end="01:28:30.300" style="s2">you know it got to the point where he</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.140" end="01:28:32.730" style="s2">could only have to sit for 15 seconds or</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.300" end="01:28:35.430" style="s2">so when he would bring himself under</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.730" end="01:28:37.380" style="s2">control and that was a victory like you</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.430" end="01:28:38.880" style="s2">if you imagine the neurological systems</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.380" end="01:28:40.830" style="s2">developed that are responsible for</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.880" end="01:28:42.690" style="s2">personality integration</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.830" end="01:28:44.490" style="s2">a victory for those systems because they</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.690" end="01:28:47.120" style="s2">were attaining the ability to regulate</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.490" end="01:28:50.400" style="s2">the lower order spontaneous emotions and</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.120" end="01:28:52.380" style="s2">you know and and he turned into an</p>
