<p begin="00:00:00.640" end="00:00:03.919" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s see if we can do a a</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.800" end="00:00:07.200" style="s2">one-take</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.919" end="00:00:10.400" style="s2">stream of consciousness um expression of</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.200" end="00:00:12.160" style="s2">a at least my version of the the theory</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.400" end="00:00:14.880" style="s2">of the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.160" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">so this is a reference to stuart</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.880" end="00:00:17.119" style="s2">kaufman&#39;s theory of the adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:19.600" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">and has been significantly influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.600" end="00:00:24.080" style="s2">conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:26.000" style="s2">greg heinrichs and his theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.080" end="00:00:28.240" style="s2">talk the theory of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.000" end="00:00:30.400" style="s2">all right so here&#39;s the notion let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.240" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.400" end="00:00:33.920" style="s2">a garage and in the garage you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:38.000" style="s2">bunch of piece parts</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.920" end="00:00:38.879" style="s2">legos you have some ability to put legos</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.000" end="00:00:42.079" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.879" end="00:00:44.879" style="s2">and the the notion is that on occasion</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.079" end="00:00:45.360" style="s2">when you put legos together there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.879" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.360" end="00:00:51.520" style="s2">a click and some new piece part emerges</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to make this simple so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.760" style="s2">say you&#39;ve got 100 legos</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:56.559" style="s2">well the number of possible combinations</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.760" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">right i can have</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.559" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">every pairwise connection that i can</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">also have every triatic connection every</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:04.159" style="s2">four connection all the way up to every</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">99 connection which is a very large</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:10.320" style="s2">this is stewart&#39;s theory a very large</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:13.840" style="s2">space of possible combinations</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.320" end="00:01:15.439" style="s2">and i essentially have three</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.840" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">inquiries all right and that now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.439" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">going to start going further into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">into i don&#39;t know whether or not what</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">i&#39;m saying is is straight</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">mainstream stewart&#39;s theory or or just</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2">my own sort of weird variation on it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:28.159" style="s2">just bear with me</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.000" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">all right so i&#39;ve got my my box of 100</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.159" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">pieces</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.880" style="s2">and i i start putting them together and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">then i get a click</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.880" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">all right something new has happened now</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:39.439" style="s2">here&#39;s the key now i have 101 pieces</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">all right so the space of combinatorics</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.439" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">went from a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">things that i could potentially put</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">together in all these different</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:46.880" style="s2">configurations to 101</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">right now of course that increases the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.880" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">whole space geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:52.840" style="s2">and the next click i now have 102 and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">the whole space continues to go up</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.840" end="00:01:58.640" style="s2">geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:02:01.920" style="s2">all right now here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.640" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">i&#39;m going to identify the the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.920" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">the combinatorial of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">combinations</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">as the possibility space possibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:14.239" style="s2">one and then and then when i move to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">new so if we move from 100 to 101</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.239" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">i&#39;ve gone out to a possibility space two</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">101 so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s some sort of uh volume i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:22.080" style="s2">just going to use volume to represent</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.080" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">geometry so as the as the number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:27.200" style="s2">things to be combined increases the</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.200" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">possible things increases at a at a rate</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.360" style="s2">is has a geometric relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.360" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">some kind of exponent okay now</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">here&#39;s the trick as i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">increasing the the space as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:45.599" style="s2">increasing the volume</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">that could be explored the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.599" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">space is increasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">but i still actually have two</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">fundamental constraints um</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">the first constraint is something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">the number of combinations i can</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:04.560" style="s2">actually test</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">given uh finite time</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.560" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">and energy and so so each time that i go</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">test that takes time and it takes some</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:13.680" style="s2">amount of energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">and assuming i have both finite time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.680" end="00:03:18.159" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a a finite number of of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.159" end="00:03:25.040" style="s2">tests that i can undergo all right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">if i imagine that as a a sphere</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.040" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">of a different color superimposed in my</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">previous sphere so let&#39;s say my first</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">sphere is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:35.040" style="s2">uh um white my second sphere is red</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">then um let&#39;s say for the be in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.040" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">beginning i go into this garage i have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:43.200" style="s2">objects and i can test um</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:44.319" style="s2">you know one combination per second and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.200" end="00:03:46.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to do the math right now</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.319" end="00:03:48.879" style="s2">it&#39;s a stream of consciousness right off</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.000" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">right off the cuff that describes a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.879" end="00:03:51.920" style="s2">sphere of number of tests that i can</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.640" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">actually do let&#39;s say for the moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.920" end="00:03:54.080" style="s2">that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">bigger than the number of tests so i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.080" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">got three pieces i can definitely take</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:00.400" style="s2">all three you know one one with two one</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">with three</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.400" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">two is three and then one two and three</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">together done did it work yes or no</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">okay so the sphere of red the sphere of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">number of tests that i can</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">do and the sphere of white the number of</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:14.400" style="s2">tests that could be done there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">relationship between the two now</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.400" end="00:04:19.359" style="s2">as i get a yes the number of of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">tests that could be done right the white</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.359" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">sphere increases</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">now here&#39;s the question there&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">at which</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:28.720" style="s2">when the white sphere is bigger than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.360" style="s2">red sphere</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.720" end="00:04:32.720" style="s2">the rate limiter on my capacity to be in</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.360" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.720" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">generatively with the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">is actually the red sphere not the white</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">sphere</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.120" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">and so as i continue to explore and find</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">clicks i&#39;m increasing that white sphere</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:47.199" style="s2">but if my red sphere is not</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">also increasing i start actually finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.199" end="00:04:50.960" style="s2">myself limited by this</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:52.880" style="s2">search through an increasingly large</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.960" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">space right and at some point</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:04:56.240" style="s2">there&#39;s like a moment of of overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">for those of you who happen to be human</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.240" end="00:04:59.120" style="s2">beings on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:01.919" style="s2">right now you may be familiar with this</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.120" end="00:05:03.680" style="s2">notion right the possibility space</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.919" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2">of relationships that we can currently</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.680" end="00:05:09.120" style="s2">engage in is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">not just vast it&#39;s sort of hyper vast</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.120" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">and hyper vastly larger</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">than our current capacity to discern</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">which relationships to actually engage</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:22.160" style="s2">in right so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:23.039" style="s2">sort of a possibility space there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.160" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">mechanism</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.360" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">actually invest time and energy into and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.080" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">then the third move</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">is there&#39;s a degree to which the actual</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:40.240" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.560" end="00:05:41.840" style="s2">a generative impact and what i mean by</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.840" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">is remember my my my block so i have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.039" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">a hundred blocks let&#39;s say i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:50.400" style="s2">only test say</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:51.280" style="s2">uh ten thousand combinations right so</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.400" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">which of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.280" end="00:05:55.199" style="s2">all the possible combinations do i</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.720" style="s2">actually test that&#39;s the second move</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.199" end="00:05:57.919" style="s2">and what&#39;s the process by which i make</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.720" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">that choice right that&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.919" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">could be random</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">but brandon&#39;s not going to work very</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:04.000" style="s2">well for very long then i&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">okay what actually happens if i start</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.000" end="00:06:07.440" style="s2">putting them together</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">do i get any clicks did i increase my</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.440" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">possibility space at all</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:15.280" style="s2">and to what degree this is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">super nuance to what degree did my</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.280" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">particular click</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:23.919" style="s2">increase my red sphere</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.919" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">maybe even more than</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.199" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">the white sphere all right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:28.720" style="s2">let&#39;s look at this in the in a more</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">concrete</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.720" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">that&#39;s the abstraction right i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:33.440" style="s2">those three moves i&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:36.319" style="s2">the the actual size the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.440" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">space i&#39;ve got the mechanism by which i</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.319" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">select the finite number of actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">experiments or combinatorial</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:44.880" style="s2">possibilities that i can run</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">and then i&#39;ve got the actual generative</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.880" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">consequences in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:49.680" style="s2">a does it increase the size of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:52.319" style="s2">possibility space and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.680" end="00:06:53.280" style="s2">b that is does it increase the size of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.319" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.280" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">the red sphere my capacity to select</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:06:59.440" style="s2">okay now</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">if you look at this in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.440" end="00:07:01.680" style="s2">say complex chemistry which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.680" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">stuart began the process</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">um i have a bit of what&#39;s called a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:09.199" style="s2">portal pathway portal pathways i think</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">are going to turn out to be super</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.199" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">important here</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:16.639" style="s2">um so complex chemistry space is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.840" style="s2">the sort of the set of combinatorials</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.639" end="00:07:20.960" style="s2">the combinations</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.840" end="00:07:22.479" style="s2">between um uh molecules</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.960" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">right so in the beginning i&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.479" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">certain kinds of molecules that can or</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">can&#39;t connect</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.319" style="s2">and then i get a i get a click and i get</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">hydrogen and oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.319" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">connect and now i&#39;ve got water and water</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">is a different kind of thing than just</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:34.560" style="s2">hydrogen and oxygen so the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:36.000" style="s2">possibility of space just increased a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.560" end="00:07:36.880" style="s2">lot i can have a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.000" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.880" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">combinations and of course i can have</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">water now combining with</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">other kinds of molecules so i got this</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.599" style="s2">huge milieu</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:48.319" style="s2">of of the combinatorics that can happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.599" end="00:07:51.199" style="s2">inside complex chemistry space</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.319" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">um okay now now i want you to think</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.199" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">about a particular location</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:55.919" style="s2">in complex chemistry space which has to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.960" style="s2">do with</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.919" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">this these three three kinds of complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.960" end="00:08:03.199" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">one is known as dna one is known as</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.199" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">rna and one is known as a uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:09.919" style="s2">a cell a cellular membrane a lipid</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.560" end="00:08:12.800" style="s2">membrane that has all of these have</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.919" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">characteristics within each other now</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.800" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">let&#39;s say for the moment that i happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">to have by sure chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">locked upon a particular configuration</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">where i have</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">a bunch of amino acids nucleotides</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">coordinated into a relationship of a</p>

<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:38.839" style="s2">by sheer complex chemistry right</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">now what&#39;s the likelihood what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.839" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">probability</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">that in the next that there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">going to be a uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:47.760" style="s2">in the next moment or in any future</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">moment i will arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.760" end="00:08:51.519" style="s2">an absolutely identical copy of that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:55.200" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.519" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">chemistry in in complex chemistry space</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.200" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">the probability of</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">verges on zero just stochastic</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">combinations i may get dna and rna and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:02.880" style="s2">cell membrane again</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.440" style="s2">but the likelihood i&#39;ll get the exact</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.880" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">same one effectively zero</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">but then we have this other thing this</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">other tool</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">so the red sphere this other way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">searching the the combinatorials</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">available in complex chemistry space</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.959" end="00:09:48.480" style="s2">they successfully copy each other in</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.000" end="00:09:58.320" style="s2">compare that to what would happen in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.000" style="s2">just a stochastic random chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.320" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">and of course this insight the whole</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.000" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">this insight of the the unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">collapse of the the probability</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">landscape into a very very</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:10.000" style="s2">narrow bound of what actually happens is</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:11.680" style="s2">the thing that stewart was</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.000" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">was was working on so that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.680" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">inside of the space</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">so we have that example now okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:21.040" style="s2">take a look now i&#39;m going to branch into</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">greg&#39;s work talk so the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.040" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">threshold and i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">use the concept of a portal pathway</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">which i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;ve described it</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">before but it&#39;s a cool concept</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">i have the the set of possibilities in</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">complex chemistry space</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">then i kind of unlock this super cool</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:37.920" style="s2">combination</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:41.040" style="s2">that has a a radical shift</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.920" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">in the uh the red sphere which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.040" end="00:10:46.000" style="s2">a radical shift in the</p>
