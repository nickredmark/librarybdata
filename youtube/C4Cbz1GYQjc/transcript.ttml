<p begin="00:17:41.500" end="00:17:49.040" style="s2">Shh slowly come out of your practice</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.700" end="00:17:50.840" style="s2">trying as best you can to integrate what</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.040" end="00:17:52.550" style="s2">you cultivate in your practice with your</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.840" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">everyday consciousness and cognition</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.550" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">perhaps by reciting the five promises to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:57.640" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.970" end="00:19:15.940" style="s2">so thanks to Amara we&#39;ll be able to take</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.370" end="00:19:18.970" style="s2">some questions here and then Agustin</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.940" end="00:19:21.940" style="s2">flies how to deal with them can I kill</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.970" end="00:19:25.179" style="s2">them oh so that goes towards said that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.940" end="00:19:33.759" style="s2">the first promise so that&#39;s a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.179" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">question and I might struggle with some</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.759" end="00:19:38.710" style="s2">of those questions I do change my diet</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:41.230" style="s2">for example about Jason and myself we</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.710" end="00:19:44.889" style="s2">don&#39;t eat mammals precisely because I</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.230" end="00:19:46.299" style="s2">think they have a kind of life that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.889" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">find it haven&#39;t valuable to themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.299" end="00:19:52.480" style="s2">other people may be vegetarians or</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:55.840" style="s2">vegans I don&#39;t want to specify a</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.480" end="00:19:57.100" style="s2">particular place I don&#39;t think I have</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.840" end="00:20:00.759" style="s2">the right to do that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.100" end="00:20:03.070" style="s2">I do you appreciate an honor that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.759" end="00:20:05.039" style="s2">are reflecting on this question and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.070" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">promise and what it means to you I</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.039" end="00:20:11.019" style="s2">suggest what I would what I do suggest</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:14.610" style="s2">to you is that you read more deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.019" end="00:20:17.649" style="s2">what enlightenment to build a consistent</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.610" end="00:20:19.570" style="s2">ethical and moral practice there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.649" end="00:20:24.250" style="s2">good introductory talks to philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.570" end="00:20:27.159" style="s2">works I think that&#39;s much more important</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.250" end="00:20:29.649" style="s2">than me just stating what you should do</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.159" end="00:20:32.889" style="s2">because that starts to shift it not to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.649" end="00:20:33.879" style="s2">rule or command instead or continue do</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.889" end="00:20:36.669" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.879" end="00:20:39.340" style="s2">my honor a deeply reflect on what this</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.669" end="00:20:42.309" style="s2">means for you don&#39;t you don&#39;t just do</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:44.860" style="s2">that in isolation read start to</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.309" end="00:20:47.440" style="s2">cultivate what would it be like what do</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.860" end="00:20:50.470" style="s2">you what can you do with genuine</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.440" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">conviction and consistency that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.470" end="00:20:55.059" style="s2">important thing about the integrity here</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:58.029" style="s2">so that&#39;s how I would answer you I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.059" end="00:21:02.519" style="s2">have the authority to make moral</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.029" end="00:21:06.549" style="s2">pronouncements I&#39;m just your teacher ah</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.519" end="00:21:08.159" style="s2">Tim Tim Dimitar I&#39;ve been meditating on</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.549" end="00:21:10.299" style="s2">and off for a year but I&#39;ve been most</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.159" end="00:21:12.179" style="s2">consistent since you started this course</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.299" end="00:21:14.060" style="s2">thank you you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.179" end="00:21:17.480" style="s2">averaging</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.060" end="00:21:19.130" style="s2">I think one hour per day these four</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.480" end="00:21:21.560" style="s2">weeks how it takes me 30 to 40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.130" end="00:21:23.300" style="s2">video guided to reach the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.560" end="00:21:25.070" style="s2">first quarter II by then my</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.300" end="00:21:26.990" style="s2">concentration and low is just mental</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.070" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">endurance they&#39;ve only done met at other</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.990" end="00:21:32.270" style="s2">lessons of your time I don&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.610" end="00:21:37.220" style="s2">I&#39;m progressing but I have but I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.270" end="00:21:38.930" style="s2">free time any suggestions yes try to I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.220" end="00:21:41.120" style="s2">not quite sure what standard you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.930" end="00:21:43.310" style="s2">using so maybe relax the standard a</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.120" end="00:21:45.380" style="s2">little bit about finding the core for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.310" end="00:21:47.240" style="s2">maybe as I said to the more light</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.380" end="00:21:50.090" style="s2">version of finding your route you just</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.240" end="00:21:53.270" style="s2">go through the set July and and go</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.090" end="00:21:55.940" style="s2">through just here right this points in</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.270" end="00:21:58.310" style="s2">the central line maybe in your flow</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.940" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">right you may be trying to get into a</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.310" end="00:22:02.930" style="s2">very deep state of absorption and that</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:05.960" style="s2">is again good but maybe again relax a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.930" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">standard a little bit so just you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.960" end="00:22:10.280" style="s2">and you know maybe spend them yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:14.600" style="s2">I&#39;m going to spend maybe two three or</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.280" end="00:22:17.840" style="s2">four breaths here here here my back get</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.600" end="00:22:18.440" style="s2">into the flow I&#39;m only going to count my</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.840" end="00:22:21.770" style="s2">breaths</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.440" end="00:22:24.710" style="s2">you know maybe three or four minutes you</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.770" end="00:22:26.750" style="s2">don&#39;t want to get sort of set</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:30.020" style="s2">it&#39;s called encoding specificity so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.750" end="00:22:31.970" style="s2">there&#39;s always the expectation that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.020" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">going to take that long to get into your</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.970" end="00:22:34.790" style="s2">Center and Ruth</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:38.210" style="s2">in fact what you&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.790" end="00:22:40.760" style="s2">slowly gradually erode at how much time</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.210" end="00:22:43.400" style="s2">it takes because if it&#39;s always taking</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.760" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">30 to 40 minutes then it&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.400" end="00:22:47.000" style="s2">to become second nature so you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:49.130" style="s2">try and trade a little bit you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.000" end="00:22:51.530" style="s2">you have to give up on getting quite so</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.130" end="00:22:54.560" style="s2">deeply into those things so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.530" end="00:22:56.690" style="s2">get in a little bit faster so that you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.560" end="00:23:00.650" style="s2">can move towards becoming second nature</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.690" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">so maybe shift your standard instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.650" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">just depth of getting into the core for</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:07.190" style="s2">it&#39;s all that you&#39;re not just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.360" end="00:23:09.710" style="s2">get deeply in it in the meditation</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.190" end="00:23:14.330" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to get into it deep enough</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.070" end="00:31:01.799" style="s2">helpful to be Athena I&#39;m considering</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:03.960" style="s2">acupuncture from some pain issues what</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.799" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">do you think about it um I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.960" end="00:31:14.520" style="s2">good evidence that for many kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:16.380" style="s2">issues disorders and diseases I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.520" end="00:31:17.850" style="s2">like this because I want to apply those</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.380" end="00:31:21.270" style="s2">terms a little bit broadly than an</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.850" end="00:31:25.140" style="s2">infection or braking which they tend to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.270" end="00:31:28.890" style="s2">be limited to in in Western medicine I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.140" end="00:31:31.500" style="s2">not a critic of Western medicine but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.890" end="00:31:33.710" style="s2">think we want to expand well-being</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.500" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">beyond just being free of trauma</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.710" end="00:31:41.390" style="s2">physical trauma and free of infection so</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:43.890" style="s2">I think there&#39;s good evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.390" end="00:31:46.350" style="s2">acupuncture can address a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.890" end="00:31:48.990" style="s2">issues especially issues that tend to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.350" end="00:31:51.419" style="s2">fall between the cracks what do I mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:53.850" style="s2">by the issues that is hard to designate</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.419" end="00:31:56.190" style="s2">as purely physical health issues or</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.850" end="00:31:58.440" style="s2">mental health issues like chronic pain</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.190" end="00:32:00.809" style="s2">right it seems to fall between those</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.440" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">acupuncture is very good for that I had</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.809" end="00:32:07.230" style="s2">I did professional training in shiatsu</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:10.860" style="s2">and I practiced it professionally for</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.230" end="00:32:12.539" style="s2">over 10 years not because like I said</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.860" end="00:32:14.970" style="s2">it&#39;s always important to do a meditative</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.539" end="00:32:16.590" style="s2">hour a contemplative hour a movie</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.970" end="00:32:18.870" style="s2">mindfulness art and if possible a</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.590" end="00:32:21.299" style="s2">therapeutic healing mindfulness art and</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.870" end="00:32:25.499" style="s2">there&#39;s deep connections between shiatsu</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.299" end="00:32:29.460" style="s2">and acupuncture so I think within you</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.499" end="00:32:30.989" style="s2">know a realm of reasonable plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.460" end="00:32:32.700" style="s2">in terms of what there&#39;s empirical</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.989" end="00:32:34.499" style="s2">research especially like I say that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.700" end="00:32:38.509" style="s2">stuff but that falls between the cracks</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.499" end="00:32:38.509" style="s2">I think acupuncture is a good idea</p>

<p begin="00:33:04.499" end="00:33:10.499" style="s2">maybe alternate between them try session</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.499" end="00:33:14.759" style="s2">indirect matter towards that emotion you</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.869" end="00:33:16.379" style="s2">just direct meta as if it was a person</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.759" end="00:33:19.769" style="s2">you may even want to name it some people</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.379" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">name the emotion about the particular</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.769" end="00:33:24.179" style="s2">emotion especially if it is familiar to</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:26.549" style="s2">you notice the word familiar like a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.179" end="00:33:28.710" style="s2">family member and then direct method</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.549" end="00:33:31.669" style="s2">towards it direct meta towards it and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.710" end="00:33:31.669" style="s2">probably shifts around</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.050" end="00:33:37.270" style="s2">listen but direct meta towards it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:39.640" style="s2">then alternate that with unpacking it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.270" end="00:33:41.710" style="s2">with the five factors of inquiring</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.640" end="00:33:46.120" style="s2">mindfulness and keep alternating between</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.710" end="00:33:48.010" style="s2">those and and right and what will slowly</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.120" end="00:33:50.920" style="s2">happen is you&#39;ll start it&#39;ll start to</p>

<p begin="00:34:25.240" end="00:34:29.980" style="s2">sound metaphysical and sort of I hope</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.090" end="00:34:31.659" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t want this pseudo Zen when</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.980" end="00:34:34.450" style="s2">you do move to that space between your</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.659" end="00:34:36.700" style="s2">thoughts there&#39;s a sense in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.450" end="00:34:39.490" style="s2">moving beyond the mind and body together</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.700" end="00:34:41.350" style="s2">but not in the sense of abandoning them</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.490" end="00:34:42.700" style="s2">and getting into your head space but</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.350" end="00:34:45.250" style="s2">they&#39;re always they that they&#39;re always</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.440" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">is going to be deeply deeply involved</p>
