<p begin="00:00:03.280" end="00:00:05.759" style="s2">you look at the two-year-old you got the</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.640" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:10.639" style="s2">then you got this notion of like this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:13.679" style="s2">set of words</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.639" end="00:00:16.080" style="s2">results in changes in behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:17.359" style="s2">sure and then this set of words results</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.080" end="00:00:20.240" style="s2">in changes of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.359" end="00:00:21.840" style="s2">that i can predict then this set of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.240" end="00:00:24.640" style="s2">words results in changes behavior that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.840" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">can predict and control</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.640" end="00:00:28.560" style="s2">now i&#39;m full-fledged adult</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.680" end="00:00:39.520" style="s2">there&#39;s no like there&#39;s no pretense</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.920" end="00:00:41.120" style="s2">she&#39;s like she just iterates through</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.520" end="00:00:42.320" style="s2">combinations of words until she finds</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:42.960" style="s2">the one that pushes the button she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.320" end="00:00:45.840" style="s2">looking to push</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.960" end="00:00:47.280" style="s2">like okay cool thank you for not like</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.840" end="00:00:49.840" style="s2">not deceiving me</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.280" end="00:00:50.559" style="s2">into thinking that right other than they</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.840" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.559" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">right right well then you&#39;ll watch at</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.360" end="00:00:56.719" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">what will happen and she&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.719" end="00:01:00.879" style="s2">playing around with lying</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">right right theory of mine drops in</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.879" end="00:01:03.680" style="s2">right and then this whole idea of well</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">wait a minute i can</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.680" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">i can make reality happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.560" style="s2">i distinctly remember coming in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:12.799" style="s2">four-year-old daughter you know we told</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.560" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">her don&#39;t eat the cookies and you came</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.799" end="00:01:16.080" style="s2">in and they&#39;re all over her face you</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">know it&#39;s like so where&#39;d the cookies go</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.080" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:21.439" style="s2">did you eat cookies no what are they</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:23.520" style="s2">cooking you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.439" end="00:01:24.560" style="s2">but what about that uh chocolate on your</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.520" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">oh okay you know now all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s like ah</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">now i can&#39;t just mold reality completely</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:33.439" style="s2">to my world</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:34.720" style="s2">so uh yeah the way in which kids lie and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.439" end="00:01:36.840" style="s2">the more they lie that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.720" end="00:01:39.520" style="s2">better sign overall because it shows</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">cognitive flexibility and creativity as</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.520" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">long as you shape them</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.399" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">right right because you need to be be</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.320" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">careful to recognize as you said there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">boundaries that</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:52.159" style="s2">you know i can&#39;t lie to a tree i</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">definitely can&#39;t lie to a forest fire</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.159" end="00:01:56.079" style="s2">forest fires don&#39;t care about the words</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">i say and the problem of taking reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.079" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">like you loop it back you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">you internalize and metabolize too much</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">of reality as being a human phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">so you don&#39;t actually get a felt sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">of the boundaries of lying which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:10.080" style="s2">pretty funny um</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:11.200" style="s2">and then you know i guess if i can if i</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.080" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">can take that and kind of loop it all</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.200" end="00:02:14.480" style="s2">away from the from the bottom you say oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">yes and by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.480" end="00:02:20.160" style="s2">humanness is also a forest right the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">the basis of the systems of</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.160" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:27.920" style="s2">are sitting on top of a more</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:29.680" style="s2">natural systems of coordinated behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.920" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">to use your language right</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.680" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">and if i if i lie so vigorously as to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">disrupt the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:37.599" style="s2">basis of communication of justification</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.599" end="00:02:40.480" style="s2">then i&#39;ve really done myself a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:42.800" style="s2">disservice because i am what is called</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.480" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:02:42.800" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">that&#39;s the technical term it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:48.480" style="s2">technical term so i&#39;d like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">us as humans we are humans who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.480" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">primates and people</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:53.920" style="s2">okay so you know we&#39;re the embedded</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">primates</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.920" end="00:03:00.239" style="s2">and then we built this person culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">layer of justification that we socialize</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.239" end="00:03:04.159" style="s2">our children into</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:06.239" style="s2">um but that&#39;s all that&#39;s the force</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.159" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">that&#39;s growing on top of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.239" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">primate world all right so in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">uh let&#39;s just just reset</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">and let&#39;s go back to just sorry what do</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">we mean by systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">right um it&#39;s a good i mean this concept</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">of justification the way i use has lots</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:26.159" style="s2">of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">flavors and meanings so uh but systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.159" end="00:03:30.000" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:33.040" style="s2">are network systems uh of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">legitimizing is an ought</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">basically okay so the word paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">the propositional networks of paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.280" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">would be systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">okay so is an ought or or what is true</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:48.720" style="s2">and what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">good exactly right okay and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.720" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">there&#39;s a holding</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">of some kind of uh sort of network i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">almost seeing almost like a matrix</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">which of course is a high dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:02.080" style="s2">network that allows a particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">i guess now utterance right because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.080" end="00:04:06.720" style="s2">were in language space</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">utterance to be positioned in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:14.000" style="s2">value of truth and its value of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.920" style="s2">good uh-huh yeah exactly i i i</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.000" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">think i may have mentioned that this was</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:20.959" style="s2">this question exactly this question</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">was my uh my thesis at harvard i worked</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.959" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">on this piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">uh so it&#39;s interesting as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">it i&#39;m actually like in the back of my</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">mind trying to dust off the ways that i</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:31.040" style="s2">thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">whatever it was 20 years ago nice we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.040" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">coordinated so it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">you know i have a i have an argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">and my argument is a modulation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:43.520" style="s2">three things one is as you say the the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">embedding</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.520" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">the embedding of a series of utterances</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.199" style="s2">in a system of justification which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:51.840" style="s2">trying to create as much value as</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.199" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.840" end="00:04:58.160" style="s2">and trying to make as true and good or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.080" style="s2">valuable uh right argument prop set of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.160" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">propositions as i can put forward</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.080" end="00:05:03.759" style="s2">yep and then and then one is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:04.800" style="s2">groundingness of it right the degree to</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.759" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">which the truth</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.800" end="00:05:08.639" style="s2">the epistemological framework of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.639" end="00:05:12.320" style="s2">loops back right because there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:17.199" style="s2">a bit of a checksum on the truth side</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.320" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">yep you know um whatever you do</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.199" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">don&#39;t do that because a lion&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">eat you the line over there dude oh</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:25.360" style="s2">my argument just fell to pieces</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">and then the third so the third piece is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.360" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">then of course there&#39;s the counter</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">arguments there&#39;s a whole of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">other modulations of clusters of</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">propositions that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:36.880" style="s2">are balancing you know in weight and</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a sensing of okay we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.880" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">our paradigm has found a a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:43.280" style="s2">way of weighing these things against</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.280" end="00:05:46.880" style="s2">right and then as we do that we come to</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">a way of saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.880" end="00:05:50.240" style="s2">that that&#39;s the thing that has the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">value the most</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.240" end="00:05:53.280" style="s2">truth and the most goodness to it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.280" end="00:05:56.880" style="s2">exactly exactly and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">hierarchically and centrally networked</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.880" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">so some of the unbelievably core things</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">right that are central to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">system uh peter limberg you know did</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:08.800" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">culture multi-polar culture work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.800" end="00:06:10.800" style="s2">and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">identified all the different paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.800" end="00:06:14.800" style="s2">and he had a wonderful table</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">where they had the core belief and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.800" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">the core antithesis</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.720" style="s2">so who were the good players what are</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:21.199" style="s2">the core belief that we justify what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.720" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">our big</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.199" end="00:06:25.440" style="s2">threat okay so that shows sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">the systemic</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.440" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">hierarchical structural nature about</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:32.080" style="s2">what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">central what&#39;s proximal to the system</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.080" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">in other words uh another way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:37.919" style="s2">at like at james madison university we</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:39.919" style="s2">have a a mission</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.919" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">statement right so then everything is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">going to then</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:47.039" style="s2">stem out from this value vision</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:47.600" style="s2">truth statement and then how does it fit</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.039" end="00:06:50.800" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.600" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">and are are you a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.800" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">system of justification in a particular</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:57.680" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:07:01.919" style="s2">okay neat so um what i&#39;m what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.680" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">to me is something along the lines of uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.919" end="00:07:05.680" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember exactly who it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">it&#39;s in mathematics but the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.680" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">i can&#39;t construct a higher logic</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">out of a lower logic that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:13.919" style="s2">instantiation of an axiomatic of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:15.840" style="s2">particular system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.919" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">creates the boundary conditions of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.840" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:20.880" style="s2">like google well you&#39;re thinking of well</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s very good alien yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.880" end="00:07:24.560" style="s2">very very um there&#39;s somebody else more</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:25.759" style="s2">specific who is talking about</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.560" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">the domain but it&#39;s okay that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.759" end="00:07:29.599" style="s2">good reference to kind of orient the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:32.080" style="s2">what what i&#39;m talking about so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.599" end="00:07:36.560" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.080" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">um you know once i&#39;ve established</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.560" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">these axiomatics i have i&#39;ve created a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:44.080" style="s2">field of play it&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:46.479" style="s2">rules of football</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.080" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">or the rules right completely like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">rules of chess exactly</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.800" style="s2">those are the that is isomorphic they</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.800" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting is that okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things inside the space</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">and many many different variations of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:04.080" style="s2">the game of chess that you can play</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">but it is also bounded right there</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.080" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:08.000" style="s2">an infinitely large number of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">that are not chess</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.000" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">right uh and so this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">the problem i think the primary problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:18.080" style="s2">that we run into so often</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">and i guess now in particular it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.080" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">of a running up against it which is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:27.599" style="s2">oh how funny the lacunae just fell</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:28.960" style="s2">into it</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.599" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">right well that well we are in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.960" end="00:08:32.879" style="s2">unpre-stable space right it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:32.879" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.560" end="00:08:45.279" style="s2">ah ah right okay so if i</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">as a child for example find myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.279" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">almost like moving away from the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.240" style="s2">location that is aware of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.279" style="s2">chess</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:58.399" style="s2">as being just one</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.279" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">axiomatic yep one paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.399" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">right um and and and and or for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">my language my cultural my</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">system of justification as being just</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:11.440" style="s2">a and by definition a finite space in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">the context of an</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.440" end="00:09:17.440" style="s2">infinite space then i am quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:17.839" style="s2">stuck i&#39;m stuck in two very specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.440" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.839" end="00:09:22.000" style="s2">one is if the moves that i need to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">are outside of the rule set</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.000" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">that i now perceive as obligate and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">exhaustive of all possible moves</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">that i&#39;m going to fail sometimes known</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:33.360" style="s2">as die</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">or a lack of fitness</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.360" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">and also um something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">how&#39;s this work like two to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.680" end="00:09:46.320" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:49.600" style="s2">there are like in peter lindberg&#39;s thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.320" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">uh there are built-in antipathies built</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.600" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">in conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">um and i&#39;m wondering to the degree which</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.240" style="s2">intrinsic and maybe it is it is let me</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">i&#39;ll explain to you exactly why it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.240" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">very creation</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:03.519" style="s2">that is that the antithesis is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">contingent it&#39;s also what you said that</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.519" end="00:10:08.959" style="s2">propositional elements open up the void</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">space all around them okay so when you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:13.360" style="s2">make claims and you may then you open up</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">counter factual space claims</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.360" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">um which is really the root of it all</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">so um so first let uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">yeah if we want to travel this path a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">little bit so obviously you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">familiar with john and his four</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">so one aspect of john&#39;s frame is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">course is four ps</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:31.440" style="s2">of knowing okay so we have procedural</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.320" style="s2">knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.440" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2">perspectival and participatory these are</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.320" end="00:10:40.240" style="s2">all by the way embodied in primates</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">they have all those p&#39;s okay um but they</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">don&#39;t have the fourth p</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">which is symbolic syntactical</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">propositional knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:51.200" style="s2">okay and so the root of this whole idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s all part of this unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.200" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">of knowledge that i built</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">this is actually the first route of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">entire system</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">comes in 1996 to 1997 okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">and it has everything to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">emergence of propositions</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">okay so what we are right now</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">at pre-propositional we&#39;re participatory</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:14.640" style="s2">we have a capacity for shared joint</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">attention and then we get symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.640" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">tagging of our objects and verbs so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.800" style="s2">antelope there okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:24.399" style="s2">and that can create all its coordination</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.800" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">we&#39;re probably got fire we probably have</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.399" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">some hunting</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">but then somebody gets the antelope are</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">over there</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">okay the antelope antelope there</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">all right is an associative coordinative</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">matrix</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">okay the antelope are over there</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:45.519" style="s2">is a declarative propositional statement</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:47.680" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.519" end="00:11:49.760" style="s2">now what that does is it opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.680" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">potential of a question that says how do</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.760" end="00:11:53.600" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">maybe they aren&#39;t all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.600" end="00:11:58.880" style="s2">so propositions then set the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.639" style="s2">the challenge which is the question</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.880" end="00:12:03.360" style="s2">you challenge the veracity of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.639" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">proposition or its utility</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.360" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">okay so once you have a meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">statement now you&#39;re making laying claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">to a truth which then opens up</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:11.279" style="s2">counterfactuals which then can be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">pressed</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.279" end="00:12:16.560" style="s2">by questions okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:18.480" style="s2">why why is that not also true of just</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.560" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">antelope there</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.480" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">because you you need in order to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">the the cognitive machinery in order you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">can certainly navigate that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">but you can&#39;t engage in veracity truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:31.440" style="s2">claim making that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:33.040" style="s2">that&#39;s why we&#39;ll talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.440" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">fundamental unit of language as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.040" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">proposition</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">because it then makes a semantic truth</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:42.480" style="s2">claim that can then be challenged</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">antelope there doesn&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.480" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">or machinery to make the truth claim</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">okay unless it&#39;s unless it&#39;s specified</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.800" end="00:12:52.079" style="s2">in relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">to a particular object field relation</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.079" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">that&#39;s communicated</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">and from my vantage point that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:59.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what the language acquisition</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">device of syntax does so so to make the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.600" end="00:13:02.639" style="s2">point very fine the the point is what</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">you were just saying which is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.639" end="00:13:08.480" style="s2">the object field yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">the notion is that there is a moment at</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.480" end="00:13:12.639" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">there is a um</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.639" end="00:13:19.680" style="s2">a distinct and intentional</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">um mapping associative</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.680" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">associative mapping to use like</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">associational</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">epistemology so the notion is that there</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.360" style="s2">is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">uh so prior to that so let&#39;s just i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.360" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">going to like</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:32.639" style="s2">really really zoom in on that because i</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">feel like that transition is crucial in</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.639" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">fact it is i may even back up another</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">step</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:39.440" style="s2">uh but so there&#39;s there&#39;s a moment</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:41.440" style="s2">at which you use some really good words</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.440" end="00:13:46.320" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just ask you to use them again</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:49.440" style="s2">um utterances</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.320" end="00:13:53.279" style="s2">it&#39;s coordinated sound making uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.440" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">has a well i guess what was the language</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.279" end="00:13:55.839" style="s2">what would you use</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s the what&#39;s the well</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.839" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">they have a shared intentionality with a</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">symbolic reference</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">you know before before we transition</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">across the line i say antelope there</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:07.040" style="s2">right um which i think is akin more to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:10.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.040" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">we&#39;re singing together yep or or</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.079" end="00:14:13.120" style="s2">other animals have very clear symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">calls</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.120" end="00:14:16.639" style="s2">okay so like certain kinds of squirrels</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">will have a hawk call</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.639" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s different than a snake</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">okay so that but they the other squirrel</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:26.639" style="s2">can&#39;t say oh you&#39;re bs and me</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">ah okay okay okay so it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.639" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">almost like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">uh it&#39;s more it&#39;s more like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">a a release of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:38.720" style="s2">in your body it is a sign</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:42.240" style="s2">that is coordinated with a uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.720" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">state and it&#39;s almost mechanical in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.240" end="00:14:45.120" style="s2">sense it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">a shift in my biological and</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.120" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">dispositional state which activates a</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:52.639" style="s2">expression um and no different than my</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:54.000" style="s2">pupils dilating when i perceive the</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.639" end="00:14:55.839" style="s2">presence of a predator</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.000" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">right so it has that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.839" end="00:15:00.320" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">up very grounded participatory up</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.320" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">okay so antelope there is of that sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:07.040" style="s2">meaning that there&#39;s no sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:08.320" style="s2">it may be wrong there may not be an</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.040" end="00:15:09.600" style="s2">antelope there but just the same way</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.320" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">that there may not be a hawk in the air</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.600" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">when i perceive it or that my heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:13.600" style="s2">going up because i perceive the lie may</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">be false</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.600" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s a qualitatively grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">that way up</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">okay exactly exactly so now so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">we get the humans are coordinating and</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.760" style="s2">they have to interact in a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:26.399" style="s2">investment sense with the antelope there</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.760" end="00:15:28.079" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.399" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">but they are not engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.079" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">propositional claim</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">and that what i give rise to then once</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:34.480" style="s2">you get a proposition you get rise to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:37.680" style="s2">the question</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.480" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">answer dynamic okay the question answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.680" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">dynamic is the proposition is the answer</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">then you can question it okay and as</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.399" style="s2">you&#39;ll notice with your children</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">the cocked into machinery of questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">is really not that hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:56.480" style="s2">why dad why why okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">well answer it okay the</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.480" end="00:16:00.800" style="s2">answer is actually where a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:02.480" style="s2">machinery comes in okay so once we get</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.800" end="00:16:05.040" style="s2">we get this is what&#39;s called the tipping</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.480" end="00:16:07.120" style="s2">point and the that gives ultimately rise</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.040" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">to the culture person plane of existence</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.120" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">on the tree if not</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">hold on can i say this so what i&#39;m what</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:15.360" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">what i am imagining and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.360" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">what i&#39;m imagining is in fact precisely</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">the emergence of a shared imaginal space</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.920" style="s2">this is the key move right the key move</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.320" end="00:16:32.240" style="s2">is is in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.920" end="00:16:36.160" style="s2">the development of a model of what is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">as a it&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.160" end="00:16:42.240" style="s2">primary at least extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">piece right how your relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.240" end="00:16:45.040" style="s2">reality works</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.759" end="00:16:46.880" style="s2">so what happens is when you begin to</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.040" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">have a shared imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.880" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">yep so i have a model of what&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">wall and and now as we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">propositionally what&#39;s happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.519" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.399" style="s2">uh basically updating our models right</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.519" end="00:17:04.240" style="s2">what&#39;s on the shared</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.399" end="00:17:05.679" style="s2">in that mall so it&#39;s the emergence of an</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.240" end="00:17:08.480" style="s2">imaginal space</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.679" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">that has a quality of reality to shape</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.480" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">my choices</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">that are distinctly meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">in the context of just my my</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:20.160" style="s2">physical condition and so these two</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">things are now sitting next to each</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.160" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:24.559" style="s2">on the one hand i have my current actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:26.640" style="s2">biological physical</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.559" end="00:17:28.160" style="s2">disposition which is responding to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">phenomenon that are going on</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.160" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">right then i also have this mental model</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">i have this imaginal space</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">which is is is feeding back on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.679" end="00:17:39.280" style="s2">changing and shifting and shaping my</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">my position right so you have these two</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.280" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">things going on which i&#39;m sure that if</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:42.720" style="s2">we looked at it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:44.880" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you can do this chapter and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.720" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">verse actually has a strict neurological</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.880" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">correlate i can actually talk</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">about the prefrontal cortex relationship</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">the cerebrum into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.520" end="00:17:53.039" style="s2">linux and this by the way this at an</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:56.080" style="s2">individual level this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.039" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">first in the animal evolution so animals</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.080" end="00:17:59.120" style="s2">with cortexes are doing this that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.120" end="00:18:02.559" style="s2">uh unplugging from the immediacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">environment and starting to run</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.559" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">simulations about particular</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">consequences okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">and then what we can do what the human</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">can do almost certainly as a unique</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:15.039" style="s2">primate before we&#39;re verbal</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">is that we can intuit and generate</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.039" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">shared attentional</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">space okay so we can actually engage in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:22.160" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">implicit inter subjectivity that starts</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.160" end="00:18:26.400" style="s2">this process okay all right so now</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">before we have propositional knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.400" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">we can intuit that i&#39;m pointing i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">gesturing</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;ve got engage in mimicry you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:34.559" style="s2">track my body i point over there you</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">intuitively know i&#39;m looking over there</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.559" end="00:18:39.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a real talent that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">have and now this is creating this</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.080" end="00:18:44.480" style="s2">inter-subjective space</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:46.480" style="s2">okay okay and then we start symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.480" end="00:18:49.600" style="s2">tagging the objects and ver</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.480" end="00:18:52.000" style="s2">and changes in terms of nouns and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.600" end="00:18:53.760" style="s2">verbs not but it&#39;s not syntactical yet</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.000" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a tag</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:18:57.600" style="s2">okay and now all of a sudden our systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">really start to come online</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.600" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">all right and boom then we get a</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">language acquisition device</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">where that symbol gets then organized</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">sequentially in towards a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:11.120" style="s2">recursive syntax okay then you get</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.559" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.120" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">now you get a highway of information</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.559" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">that not only has the shared imaging but</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.480" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">can now create</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:21.679" style="s2">propositional layering of that shared</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">imaginative and that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.679" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">that thing is going to actually then</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">create a feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">because you get a question answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">dynamic okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.559" style="s2">and what this does and just to be clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:34.160" style="s2">my understanding as i&#39;m listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.559" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">that the question answer dynamic has to</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.160" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">do with something like running a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.280" end="00:19:38.960" style="s2">checksum</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">on the propositional machinery that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">generating the</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">integer subjective space right as i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">did</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:46.799" style="s2">right then exactly i just i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">basically ran a question</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.799" end="00:19:49.679" style="s2">i didn&#39;t put a question mark at the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">of it but i just proposed this question</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.679" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">you said yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:53.840" style="s2">click click check sum interest objective</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:54.559" style="s2">space has now got some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.840" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">validation</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.559" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">exactly we&#39;re building a system of</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">justification now together</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.440" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">all right cool okay so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.799" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">let me put i&#39;m going to put this in in</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:18.960" style="s2">the field of conversation</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to show up yet but think</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.960" end="00:20:22.159" style="s2">of it like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.559" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">what&#39;s that trope like somebody&#39;s gun</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.159" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">chekhov&#39;s gun it&#39;s just this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">chekhov&#39;s gun</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">in our conversation all right i was just</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.280" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">like literally</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:35.520" style="s2">whatever 20 wow it&#39;s been 21 minutes man</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.559" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">that was intense 22 minutes ago was on a</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.520" end="00:20:38.960" style="s2">conversation with jimmy wheel and zack</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">stein a couple of the folks were in it</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.960" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">one of the things that came up was a a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">notion</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">that the emergence of language that it</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">goes it goes uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">singing predates speaking</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:55.280" style="s2">uh that that that pre-linguistic humans</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.280" end="00:21:00.720" style="s2">had this omni uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.600" style="s2">bird call like we could we could we</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.720" end="00:21:05.280" style="s2">could emulate animal sounds in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.600" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">generalized fashion we could do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.280" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">squirrel sound and do the bird sound</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:13.280" style="s2">um and had extremely high sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.120" style="s2">tonal matching and harmonics and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.280" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">you can imagine these sort of like bands</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.120" end="00:21:20.240" style="s2">of humans going around like</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:23.760" style="s2">singing and singing together</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.240" end="00:21:25.600" style="s2">creates a felt sense of community you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.760" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">not part of something and i saw that</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.600" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">what i call the gestural rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">that&#39;s going to precede uh propositional</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">yeah okay cool so so you know for</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">anybody who happens to be watching this</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">in the mindset in addition to this you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:40.799" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:41.840" style="s2">this frame that i was putting forward to</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.799" end="00:21:43.760" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.840" end="00:21:45.480" style="s2">make my own sense of what of your of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.760" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">transition is that in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.480" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">pre-propositional state</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:51.919" style="s2">there&#39;s a music of the spheres like</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.919" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">deeply connected sense of harmony and</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">interplay</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">which is primary and a very very felt</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">sense of that and it means</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:04.240" style="s2">truly acoustically right there&#39;s a bird</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">spawn but it&#39;s now harmonic okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.240" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">so now we begin then we transition over</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">the we we</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">leave eden we transition over into this</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">new place which has this entire field</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:16.799" style="s2">this entire</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:18.640" style="s2">meal you of possibility and as is always</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.799" end="00:22:19.440" style="s2">the case you&#39;ve just opened up a can of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.640" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">worms</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.440" end="00:22:23.120" style="s2">right there&#39;s lots of moves that can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">made inside propositional space and as</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.120" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">you say by the time you&#39;re four</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">you discover a crucial one which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">known as lie</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:31.679" style="s2">that&#39;s right well you made a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">important point about eaton by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:34.159" style="s2">just so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">people are following because this all</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.159" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">fits in exactly what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:40.559" style="s2">trying to convey with a whole tree of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">knowledge is that we fall out of eden</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.559" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">as a function of propositional knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:47.760" style="s2">and self-consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:49.919" style="s2">okay so like we wake up to the paradise</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.760" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">and then we name it and we call it good</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.919" end="00:22:53.600" style="s2">and evil and we name ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:54.000" style="s2">process and all of a sudden we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.600" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">oh my</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.000" end="00:22:58.480" style="s2">god cover up and we&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:03.200" style="s2">because we have that capacity now</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.400" end="00:23:05.760" style="s2">through this kind of cognitive machinery</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.200" end="00:23:08.960" style="s2">and inter-subjective dialogue space</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.760" end="00:23:11.200" style="s2">to generate a whole host of other</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.960" end="00:23:13.280" style="s2">adjacent possibles it just opens up a</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.200" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">radically</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.280" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">way exactly so so nice all right so if i</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">kind of zoom in on it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">if i take a look at the notion of lie</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s funny i actually remember having a</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.600" end="00:23:25.360" style="s2">class</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:27.280" style="s2">like creative writing class and and uh i</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.360" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m not sure if this is true i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.280" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">gonna lie but the story is good</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.480" style="s2">which is that the professor actually had</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">a bottle of bourbon on his desk like at</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.480" end="00:23:34.799" style="s2">a university</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">and he had a southern accent he&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.799" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">southern writer and he said you know my</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">my people are natural liars which makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">us really good</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">storytellers all right so the point</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.760" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">there is something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:48.559" style="s2">this thing that we call lying is first</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.200" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.559" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">this notion of iterating possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:57.520" style="s2">right in interest objective space right</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">of course extremely powerful right if i</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.520" end="00:24:01.520" style="s2">can start as i&#39;m doing right now</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:03.840" style="s2">right i&#39;m perturbating the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">space by uttering a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.840" end="00:24:06.400" style="s2">justifications</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">a series of propositions that hang</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.400" end="00:24:09.360" style="s2">together according to our</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:12.480" style="s2">epistemological and moral or</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.360" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">ethical schema and and we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.480" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">with them</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">you know right einsteinian thought uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">experiments</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">which is a lot easier than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:23.039" style="s2">engage in</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:25.919" style="s2">you know iterative practical testing on</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.039" end="00:24:28.320" style="s2">empirical grounds like physical ground</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.919" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">and i can benefit from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.320" end="00:24:31.919" style="s2">you and i can play this game in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:33.279" style="s2">remotely you could be thousands of miles</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.919" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">away we&#39;re still playing the game and we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.279" end="00:24:37.600" style="s2">could roll other people into it</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">and so the the is called exploring this</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.600" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">space is just impossible</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:44.559" style="s2">so if one of the primary pruning rules</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.880" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">or primary filtering mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.559" end="00:24:49.120" style="s2">adaptive fitness</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">is the capacity to simultaneously expand</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.120" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">the adjacent possible and search the</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:54.080" style="s2">adjacent possible and i think both are</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:57.120" style="s2">crucial</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.080" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">absolutely um then this thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.120" end="00:25:00.240" style="s2">clearly right once you start playing</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">that game then you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:03.760" style="s2">exited this is why it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">clear line like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.760" end="00:25:07.360" style="s2">phase transition what do you call it you</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">call it a junction or a joint point</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.360" end="00:25:11.360" style="s2">a joint joint between animal mind to</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">culture person</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.360" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s why we&#39;re no longer apex</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:16.799" style="s2">predators as daniel</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.559" style="s2">schmuckenberger often talks about we we</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.799" end="00:25:20.880" style="s2">we change the rules of the game</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.559" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">because we can accelerate because of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.880" end="00:25:22.960" style="s2">intergenerational transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:24.720" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.960" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">and the accumulation of that creates</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.720" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">cultural evolution</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">which now means we&#39;re on a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">acceleratory curve</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:33.279" style="s2">in the way in which we&#39;re navigating so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">we can beat the you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.279" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">end up dominating everywhere we go right</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">yeah the the guys that i talked to at</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">the santa fe institute i think called</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">that a portal pathway</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.520" style="s2">which is the same well if you see it on</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:47.600" style="s2">the on the it&#39;s a hole in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.520" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">fifth joint point is a portal pathway</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.600" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">into the digital i mean each one of them</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">is a portal pathway</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.400" end="00:25:54.559" style="s2">that then elicits a variation selection</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:56.240" style="s2">retention complexity building feedback</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.559" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">loop that&#39;s mediated through information</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.240" end="00:26:00.480" style="s2">processing communication systems</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:01.600" style="s2">and boom gives rise to a whole new plane</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.480" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">of the possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.600" end="00:26:05.039" style="s2">yeah okay so let&#39;s go there so we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.279" style="s2">we could know we we sat</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.039" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">for a moment at the emergence of systems</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.279" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">of justification</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:12.320" style="s2">and we&#39;ve kind of got a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">handle on what&#39;s up there together like</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.320" end="00:26:16.240" style="s2">now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:16.799" style="s2">getting into this shared space and we</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.240" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.799" end="00:26:21.279" style="s2">fast forward so now we&#39;ve got cultural</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">evolution you know right step one</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.279" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">humans exit the role of apex predator</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">and or start playing a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">step two they start playing that game</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">against each other we can focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:34.159" style="s2">if we&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:38.159" style="s2">right um and maybe game a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.159" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">exactly game a that&#39;s right exactly um</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.159" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">and then and then we enter into where we</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:42.799" style="s2">are now</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">right which is we&#39;re reaching the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.799" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">end of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:49.039" style="s2">phase into that exact stage so okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">what&#39;s so let&#39;s talk about that so you</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.039" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">talked about the digital</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">so let&#39;s do the same thing let&#39;s zoom</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:57.120" style="s2">into the the tail end</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">of the culture game and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.120" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">the emergence of the new thing exactly</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:04.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">so um let&#39;s at least let&#39;s ground</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.240" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">ourselves about where we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:09.600" style="s2">are so we can have a nice frame for what</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">we can be talking about what&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.600" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">difficult to talk about given</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">what we don&#39;t know is coming right um so</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">so in the tree of knowledge the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">knowledge says following matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">life mind and culture are such radically</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:26.320" style="s2">different planes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.600" style="s2">okay because what emerges is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.320" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">coordinating system</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.600" end="00:27:31.279" style="s2">of information processing and</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">communication networks</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.279" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">that coordinate the flow of energy to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">give rise to more and more</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">complex structure yep okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:44.080" style="s2">so cells store information rna dna</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">they they process that inside their</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.080" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">lipid membrane and then communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">okay then you jump up to animals and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">nervous systems yoke cells together</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.640" style="s2">coordinate the animal of the hole and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:58.320" style="s2">then animals communicate to each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.640" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">okay then when we started jiving</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.320" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">in our gestural symbolic way and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:06.240" style="s2">linked into propositions created the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">inner subjective language highway</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.240" end="00:28:10.880" style="s2">that yoked our subjective minds together</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">to create the culture person plane</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.880" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">okay so the medium to marshall mcluhan</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">the medium is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">central right and ever since we started</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">writing so what we started to do with</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:23.760" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:24.720" style="s2">we started to create an externalized</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.760" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">of our symbolic language okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:30.960" style="s2">externalized our memory</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">and then we stored that and created</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.960" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">better and better systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.840" style="s2">so that other people could then process</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">that when they learned how to read</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.840" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">and develop printing presses and then we</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">developed computational systems on</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">quantitative things like an abacus</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:45.520" style="s2">and then turned that into a babbage</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">thinking machine all right</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.520" end="00:28:49.039" style="s2">and then in the 20th century we</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:50.080" style="s2">developed the silicon chip we developed</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.039" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">the internet</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.080" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">we developed artificial intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">can yoke them together</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:57.120" style="s2">what does that all mean we have created</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">a whole new information processing</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.120" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">system in communication</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">network okay out of material culture</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:05.360" style="s2">so we built all these material cultural</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">things our technologies</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.360" end="00:29:08.960" style="s2">but now we&#39;ve created an independent or</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">at least interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.960" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">artificial intelligence network so now</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:13.919" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.440" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.919" end="00:29:16.320" style="s2">taking place in just a radically</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.440" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">different way</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.320" end="00:29:20.080" style="s2">that&#39;s my term you know many people use</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:23.440" style="s2">the term digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.080" end="00:29:25.200" style="s2">okay so the digital so now</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.440" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why the tree of knowledge says</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.200" end="00:29:27.200" style="s2">very clearly we&#39;re going to be in a flux</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.200" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">okay it&#39;s like it&#39;s like we it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">what happened when we just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:35.760" style="s2">propositions we have now just discovered</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:37.039" style="s2">digital and yoking digital and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.760" end="00:29:39.520" style="s2">interfacing with digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.039" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">and creating the whole digital</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.520" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">interconnected internet</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">so we&#39;re on the cusp where we were at</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.279" style="s2">the fourth joint point we&#39;re now on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:49.440" style="s2">cusp of the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.279" end="00:29:52.399" style="s2">and we&#39;re now just opening up like we</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.440" end="00:29:56.559" style="s2">use propositions now we&#39;re opening up</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.399" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">digital interface spaces okay so</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.559" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">something like we discover the</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">interest objective space and we begin</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">exploring how to do it good</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">yep and we notice that there&#39;s a number</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">of basic boundary conditions</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:16.640" style="s2">right one boundary condition is how much</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">intersubjective space can you hold</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.640" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">yep if i&#39;m limited to the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:22.320" style="s2">human memory</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:24.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain limit to the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.320" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">intersubjective space that can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.240" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">can be generated right therefore</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">we begin the process of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">cybernetically enhance</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:34.799" style="s2">memory and we discover that if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:38.159" style="s2">externalize</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.799" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">memory into physical reality</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.159" end="00:30:43.200" style="s2">writing then we have expanded that</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">capacity and therefore can build much</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.200" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">larger inter-subjective spaces which as</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">you say also requires the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">creation of new particular skills and</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">capacities like literacy</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">and probably cognitive structures for</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">being able to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">translations between languages and being</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">run higher level abstractions to verify</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:05.360" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">epistemology has to get stronger as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.360" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">start having more ambiguity built into</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:11.840" style="s2">the symbolic structure just trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:14.640" style="s2">map the inner subjective space</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.840" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">we also have notions about velocity like</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.640" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">as you said in distance</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">right if the only way for me to read the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">book is i&#39;ve got to travel to milan by</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">wagon</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s a it slows down the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">ability for us to share the new</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">subjective space which is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">end of the day a bandwidth issue</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">so if i can ramp up the bandwidth by</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">virtue of being able to call somebody or</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">talk with somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:36.480" style="s2">or if i can just do a video call over</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">zoom the velocity of information</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.480" end="00:31:41.200" style="s2">exchange goes way up</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">so i can now in the in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.200" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">we&#39;re reaching something along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:47.840" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.799" end="00:31:52.720" style="s2">it feels like it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">think about the quantitative qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.720" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">shift at the quantitative level</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:32:00.080" style="s2">so on this side of the transition it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:03.360" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.080" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">moore&#39;s law like the thing we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.360" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">doing for 70</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.480" end="00:32:07.919" style="s2">000 years we&#39;re just doing more of it</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:09.760" style="s2">faster</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.919" end="00:32:11.039" style="s2">lots and lots and lots so memory is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.760" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">expanding like doubling every year</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.039" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">remember that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">yep and velocity is increasing and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">of interactions that can happen is</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:21.039" style="s2">increasing and the reification capacity</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.279" style="s2">to do the</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.039" end="00:32:25.760" style="s2">checksum at the epistemological level is</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.279" end="00:32:27.120" style="s2">increasing in spite of the false news</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.760" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">fake news problem which we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.120" end="00:32:29.760" style="s2">probably have to get to in this</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.559" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.760" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.559" end="00:32:36.559" style="s2">qualitative shift</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s where things get real tricky</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:40.559" style="s2">right right that implies something which</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">is not the same as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.559" end="00:32:47.279" style="s2">person right and not the same as culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">no all of person and all of culture live</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.279" end="00:32:49.679" style="s2">below the line</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:51.200" style="s2">so whatever we&#39;re talking about on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.679" end="00:32:52.399" style="s2">other side of the line ain&#39;t person and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.200" end="00:32:55.760" style="s2">it ain&#39;t culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.399" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">yep right so that and that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.760" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">so you have a novel information</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">processing system and the way a silicon</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">chip processes information right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">then we</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:06.080" style="s2">build so now our what i mean we used to</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.200" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">have you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.080" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">rocks hammers build houses but now we</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:12.240" style="s2">build things that actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">process information computers on their</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.240" end="00:33:15.200" style="s2">own right</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">and then they get more and more learning</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.200" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">mechanisms and then they get more</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:19.919" style="s2">interface we call that artificial</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.399" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">intelligence of course</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.919" end="00:33:23.279" style="s2">and and whether it&#39;s artificial</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:24.960" style="s2">intelligence on its own like ray</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.279" end="00:33:26.320" style="s2">kurzweil thinks</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.960" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">or like i think which is really going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.320" end="00:33:30.080" style="s2">be artificial intelligence interfacing</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:32.559" style="s2">with human intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.080" end="00:33:33.120" style="s2">and as our human capacity increases and</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.559" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.120" end="00:33:36.799" style="s2">neural link as elon musk was talking you</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.279" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.799" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">we build the information processing of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.279" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">our capacity to plug into the internet</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:48.399" style="s2">okay um uh it just the opening</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">of that interface is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.399" end="00:33:52.240" style="s2">like we&#39;re like jellyfish right before</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">they got brains</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.240" end="00:33:55.279" style="s2">you know you got a distributed neural</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:56.880" style="s2">net right</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.279" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got a control center</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.880" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">system and then boom all of a sudden you</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:01.840" style="s2">can move the whole goddamn system</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:03.360" style="s2">so we have distributed and it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.840" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">more and more centralized</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.360" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">and whatever that tipping point is going</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:07.679" style="s2">to be is going to launch us into the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:09.200" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.679" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we&#39;re staring at here at</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.200" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">the 21st century this is that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.520" style="s2">blue church is so inadequate because</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:17.119" style="s2">it&#39;s built on radically different</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.520" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.119" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">sense making systems that are now</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:22.320" style="s2">inadequate to manage uh what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:23.919" style="s2">opened up</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.320" end="00:34:25.440" style="s2">right and i think we can actually begin</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.919" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">the process of making</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.440" end="00:34:28.720" style="s2">fundamental statements of what adequate</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:30.079" style="s2">looks like</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.720" end="00:34:31.359" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s where things get</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.079" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">interesting we can actually start</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.359" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">defining the parameter space it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:34.320" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:35.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.320" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">other side of that line but i know for</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.599" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">sure it&#39;s going to have to have this set</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:40.000" style="s2">of parameters</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.919" end="00:34:41.440" style="s2">exactly and i&#39;m not sure i&#39;ll go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.000" end="00:34:42.399" style="s2">okay i was just talking with a</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.440" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">philosophical friend</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.399" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">we were talking about well we can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.000" end="00:34:48.480" style="s2">what it is but he used the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">uh analogy well we can midwife it okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.480" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">that is that we can put constraints on</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">it and then we can think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:55.280" style="s2">what is adequate to see coming down the</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">pike and how to hold it in a way so that</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.280" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">chaos and order and and framings are</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">structured well there&#39;s a simple one</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:03.200" style="s2">right i can give you one very simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.160" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">parameter</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.200" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">if it if if it if it kills everybody</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:11.119" style="s2">then it&#39;s outside of the parameter space</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:13.359" style="s2">i think we can start there</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.119" end="00:35:14.880" style="s2">right if it results in the extinction of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.359" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">all life</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.880" end="00:35:18.720" style="s2">outside of the parameters certainly our</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:20.160" style="s2">perimeter space but that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.720" end="00:35:21.680" style="s2">point there is actually i think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.160" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">let&#39;s drill deeper on that because i</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.680" end="00:35:25.359" style="s2">think that this uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:27.760" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeper there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.359" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">absolutely when we were</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.760" end="00:35:32.400" style="s2">and and exiting eden is is the hint</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">right so there was a that we had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.400" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">moment where we had this</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.920" style="s2">uh this thing that was coming up</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">that had to use john&#39;s language it was</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.920" end="00:35:44.079" style="s2">at level participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">right relevance realization something</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.079" end="00:35:49.040" style="s2">that is grounded all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">to 13 billion years of evolution right</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.040" end="00:35:54.640" style="s2">all the way down with continuity</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:55.520" style="s2">right no discontinuity then we have this</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.640" end="00:35:58.560" style="s2">leaving of eden</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.520" end="00:36:01.119" style="s2">which has a discontinuity and we somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.560" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">exit that to come into propositional</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.119" end="00:36:04.480" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">which is a different kind of thing right</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.480" end="00:36:06.640" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:07.920" style="s2">and the two are you know you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.640" end="00:36:09.520" style="s2">as you said you&#39;re you&#39;re a primate</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.920" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">you&#39;re still a primate</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.520" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re a person but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">discontinuity between person and primate</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">and we try to keep them linked sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">sometimes we don&#39;t sometimes we engage</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:19.280" style="s2">in all kinds of crazy in person</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">space that is absolutely out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.280" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">alignment with our primates</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:24.160" style="s2">nature which generally makes us unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">in the long term but might make us happy</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">tell ourselves lies like crazy um</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:31.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.400" end="00:36:36.160" style="s2">the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.640" end="00:36:40.400" style="s2">that digital that total that that set of</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">digital that</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.400" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">extinguishes all life is outside the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:47.000" style="s2">parameter space</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">is another way of saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.000" end="00:36:50.880" style="s2">discontinuity</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">between the propositional and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.880" end="00:36:55.760" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">is outside the parameter space that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.760" end="00:36:59.839" style="s2">digital</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:02.880" style="s2">must must of necessity</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.839" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">be connected must be in continuity</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.880" end="00:37:09.920" style="s2">with the whole evolutionary story</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:10.880" style="s2">exactly exactly so and that&#39;s why i like</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.920" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">to call it</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.880" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">the digital metacultural transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:17.359" style="s2">okay what i hope for and what i mean by</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.359" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">the constraints of the emerging digital</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.480" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">okay need to be connected to the root</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">from metacultural down into cultural</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.520" end="00:37:31.359" style="s2">into mind into life</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">yeah and you know and and the wise way</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.359" end="00:37:37.760" style="s2">if we do it wisely we open up heaven</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.720" style="s2">and if we do it right and that&#39;s the and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.760" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.720" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">you know and by the way that&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:43.440" style="s2">metaphor of from the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">into the garden</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.440" end="00:37:49.599" style="s2">okay is a return to the garden</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:52.720" style="s2">all right uh that allows for</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.599" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">if we get it right if we get it wisely</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.720" end="00:37:57.040" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">um we can align across and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.040" end="00:38:00.880" style="s2">and return to paradise all right so</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:03.760" style="s2">check it so this is you you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.880" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">kurzweil and by saying kurzweil i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.760" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">going to kind of invoke an entire</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:14.079" style="s2">uh category of</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">of thinking of systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.079" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">earlier i think actually even the very</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.000" end="00:38:18.240" style="s2">beginning of the conversation we talked</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">about the notion of say</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.240" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">chess which</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">is it was an example of the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">paradigm or system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:30.160" style="s2">and we already did the we already did</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.160" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">the thing we said hey here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">challenge here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">if i put on my system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:43.680" style="s2">and take it as the whole of reality</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:44.320" style="s2">remember the technical term yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.680" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.320" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">because no system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">can have the full complexity</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">of actual reality and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:39:01.839" style="s2">it has built into it an entire set</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">of conflicts and blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.839" end="00:39:05.800" style="s2">and commitments that have that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.800" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">unjustifiable it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:13.920" style="s2">up to the task</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:15.200" style="s2">right so in the move to digital the move</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.920" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">to digital cannot</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.200" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">come at the behest of or</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">through any system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">because all systems of justification are</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:30.240" style="s2">equivalently lacking in this exact</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:32.000" style="s2">way exactly exactly and this gets right</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.240" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">back actually to the kind of sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.000" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">that we need</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">we need some sort of trans-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">ability</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:42.079" style="s2">right that i do think need some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">meta guiding point but there is a uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.079" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">there is a way in which we need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">realize that we need to jump above</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">our normal paradigmatic way and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:54.079" style="s2">certainly to try to take a paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">way and to try to impose it upon</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.079" end="00:40:00.400" style="s2">uh the digital is a guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">right guaranteed and it&#39;s funny i</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.400" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">we can we can dance around that and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:05.920" style="s2">anybody feels like we need to we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">double click on it but the word</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.920" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">i agree with you i completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">you guaranteed</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">and just kind of threw a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">there it&#39;s it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">degree of guaranteed that thermodynamics</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:20.960" style="s2">makes</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:22.880" style="s2">in a closed system all right once i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.960" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">closed the system</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.880" end="00:40:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s just a matter of time before all</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:30.000" style="s2">free energy is</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.440" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">gone and i reach a level of of entropic</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.000" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:34.640" style="s2">which we call guaranteed for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:35.680" style="s2">point of view of anything that wants to</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.640" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">continue to live</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">right exactly we need that free energy</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">rate flow in order to have our</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">organization if we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">lose constraints we&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">doomed so</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:46.720" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s there&#39;s some good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">there so the question that might be</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.720" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.440" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">a couple of things come up right so one</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:56.240" style="s2">has to do with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.119" end="00:41:00.599" style="s2">like a is the trans what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.040" style="s2">relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.599" end="00:41:04.079" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.040" end="00:41:05.920" style="s2">pre-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.079" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">i thought there&#39;s something useful there</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.920" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">right oh yeah we don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:10.400" style="s2">fall into the pre-paradigmatic because</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not very helpful we went through</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.400" end="00:41:13.440" style="s2">the whole paradigmatic that was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:16.000" style="s2">work a lot of people died let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.440" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">let&#39;s make that useful sure but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.000" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">something about the transparent that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">akin</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">to the pre-paradigm right right</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">so maybe we can just talk about what is</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.319" style="s2">the transparent maybe that&#39;s maybe a key</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">piece to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.319" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">right so it depends on sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.599" end="00:41:30.720" style="s2">perspective so let&#39;s go let&#39;s keep going</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">with this since we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.720" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">kids</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">okay so kids come in and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:37.880" style="s2">internalize and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">in a classic piaget way they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.880" end="00:41:41.920" style="s2">pre-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">okay at the age of three four they can</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.920" end="00:41:44.720" style="s2">bring their logical systems to a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.720" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">point all right but they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:51.599" style="s2">operating from them systematically</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">okay uh they don&#39;t they don&#39;t run from</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.599" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">situation to situation</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:56.400" style="s2">by the time they get to seven and eight</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:57.119" style="s2">and start to believe what mom and dad</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.400" end="00:41:59.040" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.119" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">okay they start to internalize mom and</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.040" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">dad&#39;s paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">which is seen as god you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.800" style="s2">just what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:09.920" style="s2">right okay and then they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.800" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">the adolescent break right</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.920" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">and they&#39;re basically like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:15.520" style="s2">there&#39;s out other space outside of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:16.079" style="s2">paradigms mom and dad maybe you made</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.520" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.079" end="00:42:21.440" style="s2">up okay and then you get the who says</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">how do you why do you say why don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.440" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the adolescent individuation</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">where you know depending on course on</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:29.760" style="s2">the cognitive complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">adolescent and the parents and</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.760" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">everything else but</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">the way it plays so now you get into</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:36.640" style="s2">adulthood where adulthoods are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.640" end="00:42:40.240" style="s2">the paradigm and we used to sit in</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:43.839" style="s2">systems that would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.240" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">a general stable paradigm across</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.839" end="00:42:48.400" style="s2">okay so you know middle ages for a heck</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:50.880" style="s2">of a long time in europe</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.400" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">is christian paradigm right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.880" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">everybody had</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">but as you and john were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:56.480" style="s2">that other time and we came back and</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:58.480" style="s2">looped in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.480" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">the parent the justification systems of</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.480" end="00:43:02.400" style="s2">understanding relative to the actual</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">techno changes that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.400" end="00:43:06.000" style="s2">right it&#39;s just i mean so information</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.720" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.000" end="00:43:10.400" style="s2">okay so what what i would say and want</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.720" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">to say is all right well let&#39;s well what</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.400" end="00:43:14.319" style="s2">comes after the adult well in my model</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">then the sage</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.319" end="00:43:19.280" style="s2">okay so the sage is then if we go to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:21.760" style="s2">wilbur what is wilbur saying when he</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.280" end="00:43:24.319" style="s2">talks about trans versus pre</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.760" end="00:43:25.839" style="s2">right so the trans versus pre is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.319" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">sometimes the trans will say what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.839" end="00:43:28.640" style="s2">pre does but they say it from very</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">different places</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.640" end="00:43:34.640" style="s2">right so the sage might say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:36.400" style="s2">let&#39;s think carefully about black lives</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.640" end="00:43:38.720" style="s2">matter okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.400" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">and just like a pre-rational kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.720" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">understand non-understanding person says</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">i hate that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.839" end="00:43:47.839" style="s2">okay but the critic of the sage versus</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">the rejecting of sort of a narrow white</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.839" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">mentality</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">okay might say the same thing but from</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:55.200" style="s2">radically different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.160" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s a tree make sure you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.200" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.160" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">trans versus pre that&#39;s wilbur&#39;s whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">point even though they might</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">and and versus convention yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:08.160" style="s2">right okay so so the inside the culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.800" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">person plane</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.160" end="00:44:14.400" style="s2">we want to cultivate a sage</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">capacity which in my estimation would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.400" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">hey you need to to rise above the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">abstractions of all the paradigms to see</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">across them</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.400" style="s2">okay to hold what&#39;s integrated across</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:26.480" style="s2">them and appreciate their pluralistic</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.400" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">and have some coherence in that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.480" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">okay so now let&#39;s talk about it why is</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">now the trans in some ways now like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.599" end="00:44:36.720" style="s2">pre well if we go into the digital world</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">right now we go up a level and we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.720" end="00:44:39.839" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:41.599" style="s2">space now we&#39;re the new kids on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.839" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">block i mean whatever would be</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.599" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">on the back side of this we&#39;re we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">infants i mean that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.040" end="00:44:48.720" style="s2">i so appreciated you and daniel would</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:51.200" style="s2">talk well first thing you got to know is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.720" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t know anything now</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.200" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">right we&#39;re back to sort of socrates or</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s just sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">huh you know so now now we&#39;re on we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">in phase</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:02.560" style="s2">another phase and we got to bring this</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">consciousness to it but also realize</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.560" end="00:45:05.920" style="s2">on the back side of this thing um</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:08.079" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.920" end="00:45:10.160" style="s2">going on that we at 100 years from now</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.079" end="00:45:12.640" style="s2">we can&#39;t even fathom</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.160" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">is that chad yeah yeah yeah so what it</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.640" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">activated me was i thought myself</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.280" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">it&#39;s funny maybe we should just have</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:23.040" style="s2">this as a rule if if in doubt jazz</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">um which was so i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.040" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">that developmental process and i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">kind of invoking zach right because so</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:28.800" style="s2">zack stein</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:30.240" style="s2">sure oftentimes development comes up in</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.800" end="00:45:31.359" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.240" end="00:45:32.230" style="s2">right he always tells me i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.359" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">underdeveloped</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.230" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">and i was like well we can talk well</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s always true yeah hey</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">i&#39;ll take that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">right okay so let&#39;s slow this down so</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.319" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">adolescents adults adults in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.680" end="00:45:56.640" style="s2">relationship with each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.960" end="00:46:00.560" style="s2">at least a piece of that in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">you&#39;re telling the story has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:05.200" style="s2">the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:09.920" style="s2">who has authorship</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.200" end="00:46:13.200" style="s2">over the axiomatics</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.920" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">in the paradigm right so we have we have</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.200" end="00:46:17.040" style="s2">two big moves i think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:21.440" style="s2">kind of hold these</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.040" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">one move is the running of the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.440" end="00:46:26.240" style="s2">per se this is uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re in the game is everybody</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.240" end="00:46:29.520" style="s2">playing the game and it has the notions</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">of fairness like did we violate the</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.520" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">rules that kind of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">then the other move is the is the actual</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">authorship of the paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">i think where people get lost oftentimes</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">many of the languages that we use like</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">say like sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:52.800" style="s2">or authority have to do with that second</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">move</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.800" end="00:46:56.720" style="s2">yep definitely you know certainly if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">looking at it from a high enough level</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.720" end="00:47:00.960" style="s2">i&#39;m like well</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:03.599" style="s2">whoever makes the rules is definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.960" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">the best position to win the game</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t really care about uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">how we play the game if i get to be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">one who makes the rules</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:13.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">happening in that adolescent moment</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.839" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">right the adolescent is like well hold</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">on now</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">i can see the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">something going on here</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">and i can and i notice by the way that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">can challenge the rules</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:27.839" style="s2">so they&#39;re not real right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">kind of like this magic thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.839" end="00:47:30.160" style="s2">can&#39;t challenge</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">and then there&#39;s okay what does that</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.160" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">look like how do i get into it now if i</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">drop into a pre mode</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">right but now i&#39;m in the indigenous so</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">if i&#39;m in the indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">systems of justification the adults</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">are interacting with each other still</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">very held</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.040" end="00:47:52.800" style="s2">by the participatory</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:54.400" style="s2">revolutionary context right because if</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.800" end="00:47:56.240" style="s2">if you defect on the tribe we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.400" end="00:47:57.839" style="s2">kind of going to die</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.240" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">fast feedback loops on that kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.839" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">notion of who gets to make the rules is</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">is is pretty is sort of distributed by</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">necessity right anybody who tries to and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">and probably at that point the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">consciousness of the skillfulness of</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:17.119" style="s2">being able to take</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">of of steering the ship by driving the</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.119" end="00:48:19.520" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">probably wasn&#39;t particularly rich i</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.520" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">no whereas these days of course it is no</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve got that right now what happens</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:28.880" style="s2">though as we move forward in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.880" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">the that that becomes the currency</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">ever it becomes the battlefield right</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:36.319" style="s2">right i can i can fight the fight of</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.319" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">uh having a particular position inside a</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:44.240" style="s2">but increasingly it becomes obvious to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:45.839" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s worth the salt</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.240" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">the only move that matters is the one</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.839" end="00:48:49.440" style="s2">who&#39;s actually authoring paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">cultureware 2.0 right</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.440" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">i can be in one of peter lindberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">boxes but then i&#39;m just kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:56.800" style="s2">i&#39;m a player in somebody else&#39;s game or</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:48:59.119" style="s2">i could be creating the box</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.800" end="00:49:00.559" style="s2">and the fighting is now going on at that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.119" end="00:49:02.960" style="s2">level right and this</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.559" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">forensic conflict because there is no</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.960" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">meta paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">that can imperially distribute justice</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:09.839" style="s2">which is just to say systems of</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.839" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">across all paradigms because at any</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:15.920" style="s2">point i can instantiate another paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">which does not accept the axiomatics of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.920" end="00:49:19.760" style="s2">that paradigm and we&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">right there you go and we&#39;re stuck now</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.760" end="00:49:23.599" style="s2">in in and i guess you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">against the postmodernists</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.599" end="00:49:27.680" style="s2">not it like they were correct that right</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">all sitting still on top of just</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.680" end="00:49:32.079" style="s2">nature right in nature the law of tooth</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">and claw</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.079" end="00:49:38.000" style="s2">predates the system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:39.280" style="s2">um okay so that&#39;s all there so we end up</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.000" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">we end up with that as a as an</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.280" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">acknowledgement as a recognition</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:46.079" style="s2">now when you speak to the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:48.559" style="s2">sage who&#39;s going beyond the adult</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.079" end="00:49:49.520" style="s2">first of all the sage is aware of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.559" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.520" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">and one of the things they have</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">metacognitive awareness it&#39;s okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">can base it i</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:58.079" style="s2">am a justifier huh and i was situated in</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">a justification</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.079" end="00:50:03.280" style="s2">huh i wonder what that is i can now</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:05.760" style="s2">empathize that other people were too</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.280" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">now i can consider this how do i know my</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.760" end="00:50:09.440" style="s2">position&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">you know the the socrates that all i</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.440" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">mean his</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.240" style="s2">i would argue that socrates really finds</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:16.640" style="s2">formal epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.240" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">okay and the socratic method is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.640" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">realization that we built these systems</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:23.599" style="s2">of justification just on</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:25.040" style="s2">pragmatic convention right and then he</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.599" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">is he thinks about it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.040" end="00:50:27.760" style="s2">mathematics and then looks at our logic</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">system is like</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.760" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">yeah no we&#39;re just basically bsing right</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">that&#39;s why i didn&#39;t know anything all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">a sudden that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:38.480" style="s2">i poked literally just twice and</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:40.319" style="s2">realized there was nothing but right it</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.480" end="00:50:42.240" style="s2">was all just a bunch of bs</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.319" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh my god they were building</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.240" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">these pyramids to show that they had</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:49.040" style="s2">right but actually it was just a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:50.319" style="s2">performative act to gain control and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.040" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">then they would be on top of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.319" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">they could legitimize it but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:56.480" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t axiomatic at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:57.440" style="s2">pythagoras theorem that&#39;s deductive it</p>

<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:13.119" style="s2">right because it didn&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.040" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">actually it&#39;s trapped inside the process</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.119" end="00:51:16.319" style="s2">of justification</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t it does it can the</p>

<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">we got to pay attention how to align</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">back to it right and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.280" end="00:52:36.000" style="s2">exactly right the fantasize in some</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.319" end="00:52:54.079" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re of that type i would</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">invite you to just think it through</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.079" end="00:52:57.359" style="s2">like right just think very clearly about</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">all the different things we were just</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:02.800" style="s2">you will arrive at the conclusion that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:05.599" style="s2">that&#39;s actually illogical</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:07.119" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a bad idea it can you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.599" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">formally prove</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.119" end="00:53:13.599" style="s2">that it cannot work therefore</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">some alternative approach is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.599" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">and we can propose</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:19.359" style="s2">what an alternative approach looks like</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">which is first and foremost to</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.359" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">re-stitch the continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:26.000" style="s2">relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:27.200" style="s2">and propositional structures right that</p>

<p begin="00:53:27.200" end="00:53:32.000" style="s2">the discontinuity first and foremost</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.480" end="00:53:34.640" style="s2">that has to be brought back into</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.000" end="00:53:37.319" style="s2">continuity and it&#39;s not that complicated</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.640" end="00:53:38.960" style="s2">right it&#39;s a way of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.319" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">reactivate well</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.960" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s actually not complicated it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">just hard because we spent 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:46.240" style="s2">extinguishing capacities</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:47.520" style="s2">but and really intensely over the past</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.240" end="00:53:50.079" style="s2">several hundred years and</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.520" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">right well once we develop civilization</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.079" end="00:53:52.760" style="s2">but if we develop the cities in just the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:55.760" style="s2">right way</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.760" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">somebody yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.760" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">you know get school gone</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:04.160" style="s2">right just get rid of that um which</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean by the way we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.160" end="00:54:08.480" style="s2">thoughtful about how we</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:10.240" style="s2">promote development oh god right</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.480" end="00:54:12.240" style="s2">machinery that was sort of copied from</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.240" end="00:54:13.760" style="s2">the prussians</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.240" end="00:54:15.599" style="s2">not the right way to do this it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.760" end="00:54:17.359" style="s2">bad idea right you want to rewind rewind</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.599" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">not more more more which is crazy it</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.359" end="00:54:19.839" style="s2">drives me nuts right whenever we run</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:21.440" style="s2">into a problem we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.839" end="00:54:23.119" style="s2">well how about more of this stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.440" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">is terrible oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.119" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">how about none of it and then do</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:28.000" style="s2">something different can we</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.359" style="s2">escape from that paradigmatic trap well</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.000" end="00:54:30.880" style="s2">this is what the hope is</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.359" end="00:54:32.480" style="s2">is the hope is that with the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.880" end="00:54:33.440" style="s2">insights of course zach go back to zack</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.480" end="00:54:36.079" style="s2">stein of course in</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.440" end="00:54:37.119" style="s2">not only educa development but education</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.079" end="00:54:39.760" style="s2">right we need the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">teacherly authority to manage the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.760" end="00:54:42.880" style="s2">intergenerational transmission of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.040" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.880" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">in the right way if we are going to go</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.040" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">through if we&#39;re going to midwife this</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:50.640" style="s2">yeah right and and this is a nightmare</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.000" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">for us</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.640" end="00:54:54.400" style="s2">this is unbelievably complicated if we</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">don&#39;t get the parameters right</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.400" end="00:54:59.440" style="s2">why because the world is changing so</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:00.960" style="s2">fast and the paradigms are so outdated</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.440" end="00:55:02.400" style="s2">right that the kids are looking back to</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.960" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">us and saying you guys are you guys</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.400" end="00:55:05.680" style="s2">don&#39;t know anything</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:06.400" style="s2">right right right and at one level</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.680" end="00:55:07.920" style="s2">they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.400" end="00:55:09.440" style="s2">of course but then they&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.920" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">vulnerable you know all of a sudden i</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.440" end="00:55:11.680" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:13.920" style="s2">i was talking about yeah i spent three</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.680" end="00:55:16.960" style="s2">hours a day uh in the last three days on</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.920" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">on tick tock i was like what i was like</p>

<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:26.319" style="s2">wisdom and depth and connecting to</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">wisdom traditions right you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.319" end="00:55:29.599" style="s2">it&#39;s like we need to have something and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:31.040" style="s2">not spending three days on tick tock</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.599" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s why you&#39;re three days on peak</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.040" end="00:55:34.319" style="s2">talk it&#39;s just not all right so</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.559" end="00:55:42.079" style="s2">out i can but they&#39;re really vague right</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">now but i think i can i can get them out</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.079" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">okay so the one that&#39;s gonna come later</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:51.960" style="s2">the protocols the metacognitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:55.280" style="s2">protocols or the protocols of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.960" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">transparent culture</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.280" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">something like that yep got it</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.640" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">all right and then and then here the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.400" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">thing that&#39;s going to come first</p>

<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">and i like that idea of demoralizing or</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">humiliating paragraphs just take them</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:25.040" style="s2">off their</p>

<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:40.319" style="s2">identify a bunch of games and i can say</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">okay each one of these games is</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.319" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">a system of justification that has some</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:47.280" style="s2">set of axiomatics</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.400" style="s2">um and you know a series of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">epistemological</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.400" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">and uh ethical or moral actually moral</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:55.839" style="s2">epistemological and moral</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:57.920" style="s2">um evaluating functions the position and</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.839" end="00:56:58.319" style="s2">proposition inside that space that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.920" end="00:57:01.599" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.319" end="00:57:02.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about um okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.599" end="00:57:04.880" style="s2">now now what i&#39;m gonna do is i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.960" end="00:57:06.400" style="s2">say like</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.880" end="00:57:08.079" style="s2">two or three things and it actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.400" end="00:57:10.640" style="s2">starts to get pretty simple so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.079" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">gonna say is those games are tools</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">they&#39;re a means to an end um</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">they&#39;re not an end in themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:20.079" style="s2">they&#39;re certainly not the whole story</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.960" end="00:57:23.559" style="s2">so what a transparent mind</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.079" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">is good at is creating and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.559" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">instantiating paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:30.559" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:32.160" style="s2">good artisan right an artisan is not a</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">the idea that jig is a great metaphor if</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">i need to build a tool to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">like i can kind of try to struggle my</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">way through by</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">shoehorning a bunch of tools i mean yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:03.680" style="s2">you can use a screwdriver as a hammer if</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:05.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.680" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">but maybe a hammer is the right thing to</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.280" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">do right so that that ability to</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">actually say i am not my tools</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.720" style="s2">i am the author of the tools and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:15.440" style="s2">anchor yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.720" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">in that location which is our humanness</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.440" end="00:58:19.119" style="s2">right we have that we are that thing</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">which gave rise to paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.119" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">we are not the paradigm and so to build</p>

<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">a skillfulness right able to discern</p>

<p begin="00:58:51.680" end="00:58:56.240" style="s2">skillful creation exactly and i love the</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.240" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">you know shift uh that layer of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.400" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">self-reflective awareness that allows</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.799" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re outside of the paradigm</p>

<p begin="00:59:40.960" end="00:59:45.440" style="s2">tysonic perches key messages hey guys is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:48.559" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">knowing right is more better</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.559" end="00:59:51.839" style="s2">at dealing with complexity than</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:54.640" style="s2">paradigms are</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.839" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">paradigms are really good at optimizing</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:00.400" style="s2">but they don&#39;t deal with complexity</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">right okay right so so</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.400" end="01:00:04.000" style="s2">uh i&#39;ll just so with uh lean and rachel</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:05.440" style="s2">anderson</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.000" end="01:00:07.680" style="s2">you know in her book modern</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.440" end="01:00:09.680" style="s2">metamodernity all right and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.680" end="01:00:10.880" style="s2">mesh this with justification systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">theory so</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.880" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">her angle on metamodernism is there are</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:21.119" style="s2">four major sensibilities oral indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:22.720" style="s2">okay pre-modern formal modern</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.119" end="01:00:24.559" style="s2">scientific liberal democratic and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.720" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">post-modern okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.559" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">and they each have a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:31.599" style="s2">sensibility ethos</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:33.359" style="s2">you know logic right so you know when i</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.599" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">when i what are the rules of my house</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.359" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">how do i relate to my kids and my wife</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.880" style="s2">that&#39;s oral indigenous right we make</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">those things together we embody them</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.880" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">together we decide</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:43.599" style="s2">you know then there&#39;s a mythos ethos at</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">some level</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.599" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">okay that we need to reference which</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">would what is the religion that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">religion and the role that that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">to play</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:53.520" style="s2">right we need to have a logical</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">structure that does allow us some truth</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.520" end="01:00:57.119" style="s2">claims about the objective nature</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">modernism does that pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.119" end="01:01:00.079" style="s2">post-modernism critiques the danger in</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:01.680" style="s2">which that</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.079" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">maybe gets empowered and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.680" end="01:01:05.359" style="s2">legitimizes as a hegemony</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:07.440" style="s2">right which is there and reminds us</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.359" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">there is no one stance</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.440" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">to have and the trans-paradigmatic</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">position would be</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:18.480" style="s2">some way of including and transcending</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:20.240" style="s2">those and place them aptly in</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.480" end="01:01:22.079" style="s2">the time between worlds that we find</p>

<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">really so so then let&#39;s flip to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.839" end="01:01:31.200" style="s2">notion the protocols because because we</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:33.359" style="s2">in some sense we were just describing</p>

<p begin="01:01:33.359" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">inter-subjective space</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.960" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.240" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">i like the idea of protocol because at</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.599" end="01:01:45.200" style="s2">least it reminds me of you know in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">internet there are protocols</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.200" end="01:01:49.520" style="s2">that they facilitate communication they</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:50.319" style="s2">do not dictate what happens inside the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.520" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.319" end="01:01:53.280" style="s2">they put constraints</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">some simple ones</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.240" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">sorry actually let me back up a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.000" end="01:02:05.839" style="s2">bit i want to put something in there</p>

<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">and that shows up a lot in kind of the</p>

<p begin="01:02:25.359" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">postmodernism</p>

<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:54.480" style="s2">uh and and i should say by the way it</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.520" end="01:03:55.920" style="s2">sort of had to happen</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.480" end="01:03:57.280" style="s2">it was just it&#39;s part of the story it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.920" end="01:03:59.039" style="s2">part of the natural arc thing it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.280" end="01:04:02.960" style="s2">different than a lightning bolt i mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:06.480" style="s2">okay so but here we are um</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.960" end="01:04:09.599" style="s2">and you know we&#39;re faced with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.480" end="01:04:12.480" style="s2">uh a remembering or a re-skilling</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.599" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">and say okay there&#39;s a uh we&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.480" end="01:04:14.079" style="s2">been d</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:15.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve been in the matrix we i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.079" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve used this metaphor before like</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.119" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve been in the matrix</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">now we&#39;re out of the matrix and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:20.559" style="s2">sort of this floppy body that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">have muscle tone</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.559" end="01:04:26.480" style="s2">yep fair enough that&#39;s where we are but</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:28.079" style="s2">it&#39;s actually not that insanely hard</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.480" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">because for a sizable arc of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.079" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">developmental environment we actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:32.559" style="s2">were building the core stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:34.480" style="s2">and you know by the time as you say by</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.559" end="01:04:35.839" style="s2">the time you&#39;re four five six seven</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.480" end="01:04:37.200" style="s2">you actually have got you know all the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.839" end="01:04:38.319" style="s2">things i needed to learn live i knew</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.200" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">before kindergarten</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.319" end="01:04:42.559" style="s2">you got some of the basic stuff so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">sort of return back that child&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.559" end="01:04:45.520" style="s2">children are actually decently</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:46.240" style="s2">functional in relevance realization so</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.520" end="01:04:48.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve got it</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.240" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">you just have to kind of like be okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.240" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">with with building it up from there and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">building skillfulness</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:55.280" style="s2">and i like this notion of artistry and</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">so our job is to actually develop</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.280" end="01:04:58.799" style="s2">develop an</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:59.440" style="s2">artistry in this transparent location</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.799" end="01:05:01.280" style="s2">this is i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.440" end="01:05:03.920" style="s2">intersubjective space absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.280" end="01:05:06.160" style="s2">i&#39;m there so what i what i what i want</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.920" end="01:05:09.760" style="s2">is the net notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.160" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">like omni jazz where you know i bring my</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.760" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">whole package</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:14.319" style="s2">yep everything i&#39;ve got into the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:15.760" style="s2">encounter with you</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.319" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">and you bring everything you&#39;ve got into</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.760" end="01:05:19.119" style="s2">the encounter with me but we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">transparent medic space it&#39;s like i</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.119" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen here</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:23.599" style="s2">it could be anything i think actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.319" style="s2">game is not predefined</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.599" end="01:05:28.400" style="s2">right but what what is present is the</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.319" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">protocols for producing games</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.400" end="01:05:33.599" style="s2">right one protocol is be an artist and</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">build increasing skillfulness in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.599" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">ambient</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:38.240" style="s2">hominid primate gift that is yours and</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:40.640" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.240" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">paradigmatic play and drop in and out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.640" end="01:05:44.079" style="s2">paradigm shift and modify them play with</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">them notice how they work you got to get</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.079" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">good at it this is a thing it&#39;s a skill</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.920" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:50.079" style="s2">good at it and notice how your relevance</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:52.799" style="s2">realization machinery is</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.079" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">just like playing music you can vibe</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.799" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">with the direction that is moving the</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:59.760" style="s2">right way like you know that it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">you just can&#39;t say it until you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.760" end="01:06:03.520" style="s2">actually got the skillfulness of getting</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:03.839" style="s2">the words to match the feelings right</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.520" end="01:06:05.760" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.839" end="01:06:07.440" style="s2">just like music it&#39;s just it is art it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.760" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">not just like art it is art that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.440" end="01:06:10.319" style="s2">art</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:12.000" style="s2">is if you&#39;ve ever written poetry you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.319" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">very clear on the notion of how you do</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.000" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">it right the order first is you have a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">felt sense then you very carefully</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:24.799" style="s2">allow the words to move until they land</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:29.359" style="s2">such that the proposition resonates</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.799" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">with the felt sense that&#39;s poetry</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.359" end="01:06:33.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s the idea become skillful go</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">ahead right well this is exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.520" end="01:06:37.200" style="s2">um i mean i didn&#39;t know i was doing at</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">the time but so</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.200" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">you know my quest for all of this starts</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">was i learned to do psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.000" end="01:06:45.760" style="s2">okay so i started doing psychotherapy as</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">a doctoral student</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.760" end="01:06:49.280" style="s2">actually as master assume and this</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.039" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">really started to click um</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.280" end="01:06:53.200" style="s2">and i could drop into paradigms like</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">behavioral paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.200" end="01:06:57.599" style="s2">cognitive paradigm freudian paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:07:01.039" style="s2">mystic paradigm you get it right</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.599" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">and watch the experts play with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.039" end="01:07:05.119" style="s2">and see how they did it and then watch</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:06.720" style="s2">the lousy ones right</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.119" end="01:07:08.559" style="s2">and then i had a pretty good gift that i</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.720" end="01:07:10.640" style="s2">could empathize with that and pull that</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.559" end="01:07:12.880" style="s2">paradigm on and see the world</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.640" end="01:07:14.079" style="s2">through family systems or behavioral or</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">whatever right</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.079" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">and then bounce around uh and be like</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:20.480" style="s2">hey all of these things make sense and</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">the idea that we&#39;re trying to race</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.480" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">horses against them</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:26.079" style="s2">right you know that you know like</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:27.839" style="s2">compete and say oh family systems is the</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.079" end="01:07:29.520" style="s2">best you come to my program and learn</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.839" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">that and behaviorism is the best it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.520" end="01:07:33.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:36.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just not no you know so uh</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.920" end="01:07:37.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s like so anyway just and that of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.480" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">course psychotherapy is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.920" end="01:07:40.400" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:42.480" style="s2">how you relate to people so i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.400" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">is that in a particularly sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.480" end="01:07:47.440" style="s2">uh salient example it&#39;s like yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:49.920" style="s2">can actually jump into paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.440" end="01:07:51.520" style="s2">and play with them you know and learn</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:53.920" style="s2">how to speak the different ones and</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.520" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">relate participatory and indigenous ways</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.920" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">with people as you do</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been sold a bill of good that</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:00.640" style="s2">your whole identity has to be these</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">propositional paradigms and if you step</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.640" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">outside of them you&#39;re betraying them</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:04.559" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.000" style="s2">yes that village is crucial right and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.559" end="01:08:07.039" style="s2">that&#39;s i&#39;m gonna double click on that</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.000" end="01:08:08.319" style="s2">just to make sure it</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.039" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">gets the right kind of bias it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.319" end="01:08:12.240" style="s2">hey you are not a person</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">or more specifically you are not an</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.240" end="01:08:17.040" style="s2">identity right</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.239" style="s2">totally more vastly vastly more in fact</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.040" end="01:08:20.799" style="s2">infinitely more but we will not get</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.239" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">there just yet</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.799" end="01:08:24.319" style="s2">crucial right to the degree to which you</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.719" end="01:08:27.759" style="s2">are struggling to</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.319" end="01:08:28.719" style="s2">sort of valorize your identity i get it</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.759" end="01:08:28.960" style="s2">right you definitely don&#39;t want to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.719" end="01:08:31.040" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.960" end="01:08:32.799" style="s2">have your identity be devalorized but</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.040" end="01:08:34.400" style="s2">you are not your identity</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.799" end="01:08:35.679" style="s2">because your identity is a manifestation</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.400" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">of a context of a particular culture</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.679" end="01:08:38.880" style="s2">which just say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:40.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a piece of a paradigm and we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.880" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">transparatigmatic man so you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.400" end="01:08:44.480" style="s2">actually play and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:45.759" style="s2">this is um my version of what you just</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.480" end="01:08:48.560" style="s2">said was actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.759" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">i i i discovered dungeons and dragons in</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.560" end="01:08:53.600" style="s2">second grade</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:55.679" style="s2">right so the time where my my sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.600" end="01:08:56.640" style="s2">cultural paradigm hadn&#39;t really settled</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.679" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.640" end="01:09:00.960" style="s2">i was introduced to a world building</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:04.319" style="s2">role-playing game</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.960" end="01:09:05.920" style="s2">which was cool and i was obsessive so i</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.319" end="01:09:07.120" style="s2">and i didn&#39;t just stick to that game i</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.920" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">started realizing you could actually get</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">all kinds of games so i started getting</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:11.040" style="s2">other games they were in different</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:12.080" style="s2">milieu like some were science fiction</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.040" end="01:09:13.920" style="s2">some were different variations on</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.080" end="01:09:15.839" style="s2">fantasy what i noticed was that</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.920" end="01:09:17.359" style="s2">you know each one was composed of a set</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.839" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">of basic rules</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">right basic rules involved how do you</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">create your character what&#39;s your person</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:24.480" style="s2">then was how do you navigate your</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">characters moving through the</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:28.719" style="s2">intersubjective model of reality which</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:29.759" style="s2">is essentially your culture space right</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.719" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">those are the two</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.759" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">two structures and um and then of course</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:36.880" style="s2">what happens of course that that insight</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:38.080" style="s2">could not be lost as i was interacting</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.880" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.080" end="01:09:41.199" style="s2">the role-playing game that we call our</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">culture right</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.199" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">i was like oh okay so basically this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">just a really shitty game that for some</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:47.920" style="s2">reason i&#39;m obligated to play</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:50.000" style="s2">all right and that was like like an</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.920" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">insight probably like in fourth grade</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.000" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">because of that developmental context</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">absolutely um</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:58.080" style="s2">okay so protocol one</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:10:00.000" style="s2">just increase your skillfulness your</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.080" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">artistry your mastery</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.000" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">of of playing in paradigm space and to</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:05.280" style="s2">become a</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.920" end="01:10:09.120" style="s2">in this new in this post-digital</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.280" end="01:10:11.120" style="s2">environment all right protocol 2</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.120" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">bring it right when you&#39;re showing up in</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.120" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">an encounter</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.920" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">and i love this with another artist and</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.960" end="01:10:20.560" style="s2">by the way that artist might be too</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:21.760" style="s2">i guarantee you if you enter if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.560" end="01:10:22.800" style="s2">interact with the two-year-old as if</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.760" end="01:10:24.560" style="s2">you&#39;re interacting with a</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.800" end="01:10:26.960" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic artist</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.560" end="01:10:28.840" style="s2">you will have a better encounter and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.960" end="01:10:31.199" style="s2">will learn more</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.840" end="01:10:31.760" style="s2">um she&#39;ll she&#39;ll have something to teach</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.199" end="01:10:33.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.760" end="01:10:35.360" style="s2">and the point is to say hey that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.520" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">teacherly authority</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.360" end="01:10:38.480" style="s2">that happens first and foremost at any</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">encounter</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.480" end="01:10:42.560" style="s2">is your own skillfulness your own</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">development the thing that happens when</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.560" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">you and i</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:46.960" style="s2">meet greg what happens is i am</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">transformed by the encounter</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.960" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">right vice versa right first thing in</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">the protocol the very first thing is</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">that i am coming in not just expecting</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:57.520" style="s2">but intending</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">and with commitment that it will happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.520" end="01:11:00.320" style="s2">that i will be transformed in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">account and by the way transformed</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.320" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">for the better and for the better goes</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:06.239" style="s2">back to protocol one i should say</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:07.920" style="s2">in terms of my mastery and skillfulness</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.239" end="01:11:11.040" style="s2">of navigating reality</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.920" end="01:11:14.159" style="s2">and becoming an artist of paradigms in</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.040" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">navigating reality as well</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.159" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">okay so now we get to protocol three all</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.239" end="01:11:19.360" style="s2">right now now protocol three</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:20.640" style="s2">it&#39;s in this order right we have to have</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.360" end="01:11:22.239" style="s2">to hold it in that fashion protocol</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.640" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">three are kind of like the</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.239" end="01:11:25.679" style="s2">heuristics of encounters here&#39;s a simple</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.679" end="01:11:29.360" style="s2">don&#39;t kill the other person with</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">physical violence</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.360" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">it tends to shut things down right it</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:34.400" style="s2">makes the encounter much less than it</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">could be</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.400" end="01:11:37.679" style="s2">amen but these are heuristics right</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:39.199" style="s2">that&#39;s just uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.679" end="01:11:40.560" style="s2">maybe the game maybe what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.199" end="01:11:42.159" style="s2">right now is you&#39;re in combat</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.560" end="01:11:43.520" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s a beautiful combat maybe what</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.159" end="01:11:45.440" style="s2">needs to happen is it you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.520" end="01:11:46.960" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen i&#39;ve seen movies where two</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.440" end="01:11:47.840" style="s2">sword fighters encounter each other in a</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.960" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">beautiful dance</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.840" end="01:11:51.199" style="s2">which ends up in visit and death but in</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:52.880" style="s2">the process they both</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.199" end="01:11:54.560" style="s2">sought as the as the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:11:55.199" style="s2">fulfillment of their being on the planet</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.560" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.199" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">all right if that&#39;s the nature of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:11:58.880" style="s2">up if that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s called for in</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.880" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">but as a heuristic that&#39;s just a rule of</p>

<p begin="01:14:00.080" end="01:14:03.600" style="s2">well okay i guess there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.920" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">have to happen now before of course</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.600" end="01:14:07.600" style="s2">this thing worked right um and again the</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:09.520" style="s2">two-year-old&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.600" end="01:14:12.239" style="s2">it&#39;s halftime man nap time is</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.520" end="01:14:14.159" style="s2">nap time let&#39;s take care of the basics</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.239" end="01:14:15.600" style="s2">and you know once i&#39;ve got that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.159" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">like okay let&#39;s think about how</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.600" end="01:14:20.640" style="s2">how like many problems it solves if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.800" end="01:14:23.040" style="s2">like basic protocol two</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.640" end="01:14:23.760" style="s2">is that my i have i take care of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.040" end="01:14:25.520" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.760" end="01:14:27.280" style="s2">just so they can show up as the</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.520" end="01:14:30.320" style="s2">artist that they are totally</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.280" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s the base case so so</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.320" end="01:14:35.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll throw some protocols from my</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:37.440" style="s2">uh structure on so you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.280" end="01:14:38.880" style="s2">keep in mind maslow&#39;s hierarchy you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.440" end="01:14:40.640" style="s2">the basics taken care of</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.880" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">right yeah so let&#39;s say and obviously</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.640" end="01:14:44.239" style="s2">fires are burdened uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.440" style="s2">or you don&#39;t have oxygen you know you</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.239" end="01:14:47.600" style="s2">take care of that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.440" end="01:14:48.880" style="s2">but if the rest of the system if you got</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.600" end="01:14:51.120" style="s2">the base two</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.880" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">uh that&#39;s physiological safety needs you</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.120" end="01:14:57.040" style="s2">get that then look to the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:58.880" style="s2">which is esteem and belonging you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.040" end="01:15:00.480" style="s2">those are and then if you take care of</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.880" end="01:15:02.400" style="s2">that actualization</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.480" end="01:15:03.679" style="s2">that&#39;s good but you know let&#39;s keep</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.400" end="01:15:06.880" style="s2">those needs in mind</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.679" end="01:15:09.440" style="s2">and can and the other</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.880" end="01:15:10.800" style="s2">system that i use the black dot on the</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.440" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">tree uh of</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.800" end="01:15:14.159" style="s2">the theory of knowledge tree uh</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:18.080" style="s2">represents what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.159" end="01:15:20.880" style="s2">com mo okay uh that&#39;s an integrative</p>

<p begin="01:15:25.600" end="01:15:29.440" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s we&#39;re going to be aware</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.239" end="01:15:31.600" style="s2">of our awareness</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.440" end="01:15:32.640" style="s2">and be able to stand in that it also</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.600" end="01:15:34.800" style="s2">doubles as mo</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.640" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">like your modus operandi so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.800" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">how do you build that artistry</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:39.679" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a reminder it&#39;s not easy</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:41.360" style="s2">actually to hold</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.679" end="01:15:44.159" style="s2">metacognitive awareness especially if</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.080" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">up with is like</p>

<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:51.679" style="s2">the event that they&#39;re encountering</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.000" end="01:17:53.440" style="s2">who can actually turn that into a joyful</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.679" end="01:17:55.280" style="s2">encounter to use bonuses term</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.440" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s crucial right i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.280" end="01:18:00.239" style="s2">called it in terms of don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">don&#39;t bear anybody else&#39;s cross right</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.239" end="01:18:03.760" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a thing you&#39;re where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:05.840" style="s2">at you have certain capacities</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.760" end="01:18:07.679" style="s2">live those capacities into the world as</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.840" end="01:18:10.320" style="s2">fully as you can</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.679" end="01:18:12.239" style="s2">but no more and no less right don&#39;t blow</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.320" end="01:18:13.840" style="s2">your charge if you overtake i think you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.239" end="01:18:15.440" style="s2">were saying that in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.840" end="01:18:17.360" style="s2">yeah yeah many people will tend to try</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.440" end="01:18:18.640" style="s2">to carry the whole load and then all of</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.360" end="01:18:19.840" style="s2">that flows through them and they just</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.640" end="01:18:21.120" style="s2">you know they blow a circuit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.840" end="01:18:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s no good right because</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.120" end="01:18:24.880" style="s2">we need everybody we need everybody to</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.960" end="01:18:27.760" style="s2">just can moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.880" end="01:18:29.679" style="s2">fluidly and smoothly into ever higher</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.760" end="01:18:31.440" style="s2">levels of the developmental capacity</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.679" end="01:18:33.440" style="s2">right um and so it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.440" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">because the marines right slow is smooth</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.440" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">smooth is fast</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:37.600" style="s2">and that that metaphor is crucial for</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:39.600" style="s2">gathering that&#39;s another good protocol</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.600" end="01:18:41.120" style="s2">another good hero yes definitely for</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.600" end="01:18:45.280" style="s2">these times in particular</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.120" end="01:18:47.440" style="s2">yeah for these times in particular um</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.280" end="01:18:48.560" style="s2">so why are we there we&#39;re there because</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.440" end="01:18:50.560" style="s2">if you if you begin to</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.560" end="01:18:51.679" style="s2">sort of back off and say okay well this</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.560" end="01:18:53.040" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.679" end="01:18:54.640" style="s2">this is actually in many ways it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.040" end="01:18:56.239" style="s2">that complicated i don&#39;t need it i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.640" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">creating a paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.239" end="01:18:59.360" style="s2">i&#39;m not trying to create a meta paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.159" end="01:19:02.000" style="s2">to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.360" end="01:19:02.560" style="s2">to position every proposition in its</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.000" end="01:19:05.360" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.560" end="01:19:06.239" style="s2">and its sense right i&#39;m actually just</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.360" end="01:19:10.400" style="s2">creating</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.239" end="01:19:12.080" style="s2">protocols parameters some of which are</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.400" end="01:19:15.679" style="s2">more generally applicable some of which</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.080" end="01:19:19.440" style="s2">are more contextually relevant</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.679" end="01:19:22.719" style="s2">to constrain simplify</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.440" end="01:19:24.960" style="s2">really to simplify choices to give rise</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.719" end="01:19:26.800" style="s2">to this positive to the highest degree</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.960" end="01:19:29.719" style="s2">of possibility</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.800" end="01:19:31.600" style="s2">of inter-subjective collaboration in</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.719" end="01:19:33.920" style="s2">trans-paradigmatic space</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.600" end="01:19:35.040" style="s2">exactly so let&#39;s build the protocol</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.920" end="01:19:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.040" end="01:19:38.960" style="s2">exactly build a protocol that allows the</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.120" end="01:19:42.159" style="s2">framing of the agent</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.960" end="01:19:43.840" style="s2">or dual agent dialectic arena right we</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.159" end="01:19:46.000" style="s2">got to have some protocols for that</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.840" end="01:19:47.280" style="s2">and then let the magic happen in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.000" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">arena</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.280" end="01:19:52.080" style="s2">yeah yeah okay so then and and and my</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:53.440" style="s2">point is uh not my point but one of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.080" end="01:19:56.800" style="s2">things that i keep trying to</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.440" end="01:19:58.640" style="s2">kind of bring out there is the amount of</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.800" end="01:20:01.679" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:05.040" style="s2">for change</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.679" end="01:20:09.440" style="s2">good change and it&#39;s crucial like good</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.040" end="01:20:13.920" style="s2">and change both that is unlocked</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.440" end="01:20:15.280" style="s2">in this mode is gargantuan</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.920" end="01:20:17.520" style="s2">and so back to that notion of like</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.280" end="01:20:20.560" style="s2">sometimes you got to build a tool</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.520" end="01:20:23.120" style="s2">like right now we&#39;re trying to use the</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.560" end="01:20:27.040" style="s2">pointy end of a screwdriver</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.120" end="01:20:28.480" style="s2">to hammer in a penny nail all right</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.040" end="01:20:30.080" style="s2">we&#39;re making holes in the wood we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.480" end="01:20:31.520" style="s2">like bending the nail we&#39;re poking</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.080" end="01:20:34.400" style="s2">ourselves in the finger</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.520" end="01:20:34.800" style="s2">we&#39;re way using the wrong tool way way</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:37.199" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.800" end="01:20:39.199" style="s2">right we&#39;re defining a tool right now we</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.199" end="01:20:40.800" style="s2">are using transparent mind and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.199" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">beginnings of some post</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.800" end="01:20:44.880" style="s2">post transfer post paragraph protocols</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:46.320" style="s2">to be able to support the defining of a</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.880" end="01:20:49.760" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.320" end="01:20:50.800" style="s2">which tool has you know it just kind of</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.760" end="01:20:54.159" style="s2">comparatively</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.800" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">has as much capacity to respond to</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.159" end="01:21:00.000" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:03.760" style="s2">as the sum total of all of culture</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.000" end="01:21:08.000" style="s2">had in relationship to animal behavior</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.760" end="01:21:09.600" style="s2">right nicely placed so it&#39;s a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.000" end="01:21:11.280" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea to do that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.600" end="01:21:13.600" style="s2">good choice to do that and</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.280" end="01:21:15.440" style="s2">in these times we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.600" end="01:21:18.880" style="s2">continue to notice</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.440" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">that not doing that is a bad choice</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.880" end="01:21:22.159" style="s2">right and and right and let&#39;s help</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:25.520" style="s2">people see</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.159" end="01:21:26.320" style="s2">also what is happening so as as the</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.520" end="01:21:29.600" style="s2">collapse</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.320" end="01:21:32.400" style="s2">of our understanding occurs</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.600" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">okay meaning oh my god what people get</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.400" end="01:21:35.120" style="s2">anxious and they regress and what do</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:37.920" style="s2">they do they cling</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.120" end="01:21:38.639" style="s2">to what it is that they feel they know</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.920" end="01:21:40.960" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.639" end="01:21:42.560" style="s2">many individuals are defaulting to a</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.960" end="01:21:45.440" style="s2">clinging of the paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.560" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2">yeah right and exactly the converse that</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.440" end="01:21:50.880" style="s2">what the situation calls for</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">is step outside and look at it don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.880" end="01:21:55.840" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:57.920" style="s2">put all in on it right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.840" end="01:21:59.199" style="s2">or they drop a lower level even even</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.920" end="01:22:00.400" style="s2">more right well they just apparently</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.199" end="01:22:02.480" style="s2">just progresses into it</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.400" end="01:22:04.159" style="s2">well they just go to core belief and you</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.480" end="01:22:06.400" style="s2">screwed me and i&#39;m going to attack you</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.159" end="01:22:07.520" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the foundational kind</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.400" end="01:22:08.800" style="s2">of uh but</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:10.960" style="s2">there you&#39;ll see the justification</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.800" end="01:22:14.159" style="s2">system collapse into that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.960" end="01:22:14.800" style="s2">um and that&#39;s but that&#39;s but it will all</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.159" end="01:22:17.120" style="s2">be then</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.800" end="01:22:18.320" style="s2">as humans will do as persons will then</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.120" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">legitimize</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.320" end="01:22:21.760" style="s2">through the paradigm unless they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:25.360" style="s2">really like</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.760" end="01:22:27.120" style="s2">you know completely uh emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.360" end="01:22:28.800" style="s2">you know okay cool legitimized through</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.120" end="01:22:29.600" style="s2">the paradigm so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.800" end="01:22:31.280" style="s2">just came up there</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.600" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">and maybe maybe to the tail end of this</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.280" end="01:22:34.800" style="s2">conversation is um</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.679" end="01:22:44.159" style="s2">liars specifically sociopaths</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.639" end="01:22:46.239" style="s2">right and so here&#39;s the here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.159" end="01:22:47.440" style="s2">it keeps coming up right yeah well these</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.239" end="01:22:49.280" style="s2">are they&#39;re a problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.440" end="01:22:50.800" style="s2">they&#39;re probably they&#39;re a problem</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.280" end="01:22:52.400" style="s2">psychopaths even more so dan</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.800" end="01:22:54.320" style="s2">schmackenberger kind of helped me get a</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.400" end="01:22:55.840" style="s2">psychopath as a sociopath who&#39;s capable</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.320" end="01:22:57.360" style="s2">of engaging in</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.840" end="01:22:58.800" style="s2">high quality long-term strategic</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.360" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">planning okay that&#39;s the way he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.800" end="01:23:01.360" style="s2">defining that term fair enough</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.320" end="01:23:03.840" style="s2">flying around all over the place but</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.360" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">that&#39;s a there&#39;s a real topic</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.840" end="01:23:08.639" style="s2">so if i if you know maybe it&#39;s protocol</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:10.000" style="s2">4 or something like that so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.639" end="01:23:12.239" style="s2">challenges</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.000" end="01:23:13.520" style="s2">is that if i interact using these</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.239" end="01:23:15.040" style="s2">various protocols</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.520" end="01:23:17.600" style="s2">and the inter and the encounter i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.040" end="01:23:20.719" style="s2">having is actually with the psychopath</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.600" end="01:23:22.159" style="s2">i&#39;m in trouble because you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.719" end="01:23:24.639" style="s2">that&#39;s the niche that psychopaths are</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.159" end="01:23:28.080" style="s2">are designed to exploit</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.639" end="01:23:29.840" style="s2">the charming intelligent ones um and</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.080" end="01:23:31.120" style="s2">and that notion of you screwed me so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.840" end="01:23:33.360" style="s2">going to attack you</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.120" end="01:23:34.719" style="s2">is the developmental response to the</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.719" end="01:23:37.840" style="s2">possibility if you screwed me</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.400" end="01:23:39.840" style="s2">right you know at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.840" end="01:23:41.440" style="s2">there the problem is is when the niche</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.840" end="01:23:44.800" style="s2">of culture opened up</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.440" end="01:23:47.679" style="s2">inside that niche parasitism</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.800" end="01:23:48.320" style="s2">of the intersubjective space also opened</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.679" end="01:23:50.960" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.320" end="01:23:52.239" style="s2">as a niche and began to explore its</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:54.639" style="s2">developmental environment</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.239" end="01:23:55.360" style="s2">and you know sociopaths and psychopaths</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.639" end="01:23:58.239" style="s2">got very</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.360" end="01:23:59.440" style="s2">good at exploiting and maintaining and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.239" end="01:24:02.560" style="s2">controlling and</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.440" end="01:24:04.719" style="s2">you know implicit everything else so</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.560" end="01:24:06.320" style="s2">and i and i&#39;ve noticed by the way and i</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.719" end="01:24:09.520" style="s2">think this is is legit</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.320" end="01:24:10.960" style="s2">but but how do i say it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.520" end="01:24:13.280" style="s2">skillful but it&#39;s a good operating</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.960" end="01:24:13.760" style="s2">heuristic i&#39;ve noticed that the internet</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.280" end="01:24:16.159" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.760" end="01:24:17.600" style="s2">so millennials particularly millennials</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.159" end="01:24:21.520" style="s2">like younger millennials</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.600" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">have a strong bias</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.520" end="01:24:24.719" style="s2">towards assuming</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.800" end="01:24:29.760" style="s2">uh bad guy intra interactive bad guy</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.320" end="01:24:31.440" style="s2">and so the person who i&#39;m interacting</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.760" end="01:24:32.960" style="s2">with usually somebody i&#39;m interacting</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.440" end="01:24:35.600" style="s2">with i&#39;m like seeing online</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.960" end="01:24:36.400" style="s2">the idea of grifter right right that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.600" end="01:24:39.199" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.400" end="01:24:40.000" style="s2">the the the culture the metaculture that</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.199" end="01:24:43.120" style="s2">we live in</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.000" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">is so super saturated</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.120" end="01:24:49.600" style="s2">with hardcore psychopaths and with</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:50.480" style="s2">what i call like default or as if</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.600" end="01:24:52.159" style="s2">sociopaths i</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.480" end="01:24:53.760" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t obligate sociopaths</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.159" end="01:24:54.560" style="s2">but have adapted to having to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.760" end="01:24:57.199" style="s2">sociopaths</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.560" end="01:24:59.280" style="s2">in this environment that the sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.199" end="01:24:59.760" style="s2">primate is sort of like seeing bad guys</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.280" end="01:25:00.960" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.760" end="01:25:03.280" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t defend yourself</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.960" end="01:25:04.159" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be you&#39;ll say subject to</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.280" end="01:25:06.560" style="s2">parasitism</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.159" end="01:25:07.199" style="s2">or pray right so the challenge is okay</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.560" end="01:25:09.840" style="s2">we got to get</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.199" end="01:25:11.280" style="s2">through that right on the other side of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.840" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">that we have to find a way to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.280" end="01:25:15.120" style="s2">be quite sensitive to when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:16.239" style="s2">encountering somebody who is in fact a</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.120" end="01:25:19.280" style="s2">psychopath</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.239" end="01:25:20.960" style="s2">then we have to have mechanisms for an</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.280" end="01:25:23.040" style="s2">autoimmune system as it were we have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.960" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">create capsids around that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.040" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">inhibit that</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:27.760" style="s2">uh that niche we have to extinguish that</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.560" end="01:25:29.440" style="s2">niche right so</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.760" end="01:25:30.880" style="s2">the end of the culture story one of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.440" end="01:25:32.560" style="s2">big pieces of the end of the culture</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.880" end="01:25:35.840" style="s2">story is the development of a</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.560" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">highly effective autoimmune system to</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.840" end="01:25:41.840" style="s2">that kind of stuff um</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.280" end="01:25:46.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s an interesting challenge</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.120" end="01:25:47.199" style="s2">absolutely a seriously interesting</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.560" end="01:25:49.520" style="s2">challenge</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.199" end="01:25:50.960" style="s2">absolutely at some other future</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.520" end="01:25:53.040" style="s2">conversation we can</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.960" end="01:25:54.560" style="s2">uh possibly spend some time riffing off</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.040" end="01:25:57.600" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.560" end="01:26:00.400" style="s2">so the justification hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.600" end="01:26:01.040" style="s2">is the idea that the propositional</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.400" end="01:26:03.040" style="s2">language</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.040" end="01:26:04.320" style="s2">created the question answer dynamic and</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.040" end="01:26:08.159" style="s2">that tipped</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.320" end="01:26:11.600" style="s2">okay us from animal mental into culture</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.159" end="01:26:13.760" style="s2">and then but that&#39;s one idea in uh</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.600" end="01:26:15.120" style="s2">the whole justification systems theory</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.760" end="01:26:16.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one third of it</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.120" end="01:26:18.639" style="s2">the second we&#39;ve been riffing off of</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.560" end="01:26:19.600" style="s2">here is the idea that actually then what</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.639" end="01:26:22.800" style="s2">that space</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.600" end="01:26:24.639" style="s2">is is systems of justification</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.800" end="01:26:26.480" style="s2">the best way to think about capital c</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.639" end="01:26:27.120" style="s2">culture person plane is really thinking</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.480" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.120" end="01:26:31.360" style="s2">propositional language system taking off</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:34.480" style="s2">okay the other</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.360" end="01:26:36.320" style="s2">uh part of the triangle is the model of</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.480" end="01:26:38.639" style="s2">human consciousness that merges</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.320" end="01:26:42.080" style="s2">out of this okay it&#39;s called the updated</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.639" end="01:26:44.239" style="s2">tripartite model of human consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.080" end="01:26:45.120" style="s2">and that gets into the differentiation</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.239" end="01:26:47.120" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.120" end="01:26:49.199" style="s2">our phenomenological consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.120" end="01:26:50.800" style="s2">nonverbal perceptual perspectival</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.199" end="01:26:53.600" style="s2">participatory</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.800" end="01:26:54.880" style="s2">are private propositional and are public</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.600" end="01:26:58.000" style="s2">propositional</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.880" end="01:26:59.840" style="s2">okay all right and the dynamic</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.000" end="01:27:01.280" style="s2">and it&#39;s called updated tripartite</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.840" end="01:27:03.120" style="s2">because it&#39;s a reference to freud</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.280" end="01:27:06.639" style="s2">freud&#39;s tripartite is</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.120" end="01:27:09.280" style="s2">id ego superego okay so this</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.639" end="01:27:11.679" style="s2">updates what freud saw and then tells us</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.280" end="01:27:12.960" style="s2">about exactly the kind of dynamics that</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.679" end="01:27:15.440" style="s2">are operative</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.960" end="01:27:16.400" style="s2">when we have this whole problem of other</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.440" end="01:27:18.239" style="s2">deception</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.400" end="01:27:20.719" style="s2">which is the justification in the social</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.239" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">world and even self-deception</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.719" end="01:27:24.400" style="s2">which is like why would we even actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:26.080" style="s2">deceive ourselves and say actually i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.400" end="01:27:27.120" style="s2">nice guy even when you&#39;re brave in like</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.080" end="01:27:28.639" style="s2">an a-hole</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.120" end="01:27:30.480" style="s2">you believe you&#39;re a nice guy that</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.639" end="01:27:32.000" style="s2">happens all the time yeah so this</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.480" end="01:27:32.320" style="s2">actually provides a framework for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.000" end="01:27:35.040" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.320" end="01:27:36.320" style="s2">shadow self where the shadow self comes</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.040" end="01:27:37.040" style="s2">with you know what you hide from</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.320" end="01:27:38.800" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.040" end="01:27:40.320" style="s2">your self consciousness system relative</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.800" end="01:27:43.199" style="s2">to your heart and</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.320" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">then how you bs other people and so to</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.199" end="01:27:46.239" style="s2">gain</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:48.639" style="s2">the frequencies across these domains it</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.239" end="01:27:50.320" style="s2">provides a way to find the flashlight</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.639" end="01:27:52.000" style="s2">so that we can hone in on the ways in</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.320" end="01:27:55.120" style="s2">which uh deception</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.000" end="01:27:57.440" style="s2">happens and then create systems</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.120" end="01:27:58.719" style="s2">protocols that allow clear lines of</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.440" end="01:28:00.960" style="s2">communication</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.719" end="01:28:03.679" style="s2">that build upon each other in cumulative</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.960" end="01:28:03.679" style="s2">and healthy ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.040" end="01:28:14.800" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a lot there it&#39;s it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.120" end="01:28:19.440" style="s2">definitely too much for where we are now</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.800" end="01:28:21.440" style="s2">um it feels super ripe though so</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.440" end="01:28:22.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll do it again i love by the way that</p>
