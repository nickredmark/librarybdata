<p begin="00:00:01.220" end="00:00:06.720" style="s2">well it&#39;s it&#39;s lovely to talk again</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.470" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">because it&#39;s been far too long and since</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.720" end="00:00:12.059" style="s2">we have like I think we parted last time</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:13.920" style="s2">in London when we had a meal together</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.059" end="00:00:15.809" style="s2">with your wife and when I was there for</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.920" end="00:00:17.730" style="s2">the lush spring price and right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.809" end="00:00:19.199" style="s2">the last time I saw you the last time we</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.730" end="00:00:21.210" style="s2">talked though was about I think some</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.199" end="00:00:23.609" style="s2">potential project in Alberta or you were</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.210" end="00:00:25.410" style="s2">yeah of course yeah that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.609" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">interesting I I&#39;m still in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.410" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">the person who contacted me but they</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">lost their bid for the Calgary I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:36.450" style="s2">it Olympics again or some other Olympics</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember exactly but basically</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.450" end="00:00:40.980" style="s2">it&#39;s one of those leads that didn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:42.840" style="s2">anywhere right oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.980" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">the real part of them they circle back</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.840" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">though they like what I would love to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:52.620" style="s2">get your perspective on this is this how</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:57.600" style="s2">do we because you just said that my</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.620" end="00:00:59.149" style="s2">works contributed in a small way to more</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.600" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">and more people being interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.149" end="00:01:04.700" style="s2">regeneration and regenerative practice</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">and lots of people use this to him and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.700" end="00:01:11.250" style="s2">personally feel like having having done</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:13.170" style="s2">the regenerative practitioner training I</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.250" end="00:01:18.299" style="s2">should have realized how deep of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.170" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">practice there was behind working in</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.299" end="00:01:23.310" style="s2">this way that I wasn&#39;t even aware when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:24.810" style="s2">wrote my book and yeah we knew that but</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.310" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">you do you figure that out at some point</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.810" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">and and and at the time by the way by</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">the way Daniel it keeps getting deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:35.280" style="s2">yeah you never this that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:38.070" style="s2">powerful about this work is that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.280" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly know it it&#39;s a continual</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.070" end="00:01:43.680" style="s2">journey of evolution yeah for me that</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:45.329" style="s2">that&#39;s the interesting bit personally</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.680" end="00:01:49.259" style="s2">because on the one hand I feel like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.329" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">been approaching the same like drinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.259" end="00:01:53.790" style="s2">on from some of the same wells and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:56.820" style="s2">approaching the same way of working and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.790" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">and and so some of the things I feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.820" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">like I&#39;ve already heard in in other</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">context other pathways from other</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">mentors having worked with John Todd and</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">David oh and um but then there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:10.679" style="s2">something very specific that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">the frameworks in in regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.679" end="00:02:15.870" style="s2">practices practice that really</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:20.100" style="s2">invite people to reframe the way they</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:23.270" style="s2">they think and I&#39;m and and so I now find</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.100" end="00:02:29.070" style="s2">myself like on the one hand the way I</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.270" end="00:02:31.320" style="s2">simplify it and in my mind is that Carol</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.070" end="00:02:34.620" style="s2">holds a really sort of true to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.320" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">gospel kind of very close to her chest</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.620" end="00:02:39.300" style="s2">type version yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:41.190" style="s2">reach out that&#39;s true and then in a way</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.300" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">Regenesis group Andrew Genesis into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.190" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">Institute who always acknowledged the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:51.959" style="s2">depth of drawing from Carol&#39;s work but</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:54.900" style="s2">also through all the other people in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.959" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">group having developed this are already</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.900" end="00:03:01.640" style="s2">to some extent the next roll out from</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:04.500" style="s2">that kind of making it more easily</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.640" end="00:03:08.520" style="s2">digestible to more people and actively</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.500" end="00:03:10.440" style="s2">yes that&#39;s intentional yeah and and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.520" end="00:03:13.070" style="s2">and to some extent I feel like I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.440" end="00:03:15.450" style="s2">the next spring out of almost sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.070" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">pointing at Regenesis group and saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.450" end="00:03:19.950" style="s2">here you can this is where you can go a</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:23.580" style="s2">lot deeper if if you resonate strongly</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.950" end="00:03:25.110" style="s2">with this call to undo the damage that</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.580" end="00:03:28.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve done for far too long</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.110" end="00:03:31.170" style="s2">and but I I now see a sense that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.050" end="00:03:33.860" style="s2">business and like large corporations and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.170" end="00:03:37.620" style="s2">everybody is jumping in on this like the</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.860" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">last round about this time last year</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.620" end="00:03:43.130" style="s2">before last in December 2018 when a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:45.330" style="s2">Walter Thompson put out this report on</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.130" end="00:03:46.950" style="s2">regeneration as the new sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.330" end="00:03:49.799" style="s2">or whatever that that was a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.950" end="00:03:52.489" style="s2">clear signal that something was shifting</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.799" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">and now like I was recently in London</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.489" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">invited to speak to people who are</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:04:01.980" style="s2">business consultants and business</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:04:04.620" style="s2">leaders around how regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.980" end="00:04:10.110" style="s2">economics and mainstream business could</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.620" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">somehow connect and I how do you sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.110" end="00:04:16.049" style="s2">like how do we work with this huge</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">amount of interest that now exists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.049" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">the fact that there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.690" style="s2">consultants</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:25.950" style="s2">just basically going through their web</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.690" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">page ins crossing out sustainable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.950" end="00:04:33.310" style="s2">it&#39;s true oh my goodness it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:35.590" style="s2">it&#39;s a terrible thing but how do you how</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.310" end="00:04:38.040" style="s2">do you meet that like how do you meet</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.590" end="00:04:41.380" style="s2">the demand how do how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.040" end="00:04:42.880" style="s2">stay true to the depth of a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.380" end="00:04:44.850" style="s2">type of practice that starts from</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:47.830" style="s2">personal development and ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.850" end="00:04:50.230" style="s2">shifting consciousness yeah what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.830" end="00:04:52.390" style="s2">said yes just what you said there is so</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.230" end="00:04:54.280" style="s2">key Daniel it starts from personal</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.390" end="00:04:56.200" style="s2">development actually it starts from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.280" end="00:04:58.660" style="s2">whole because you can start anywhere you</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.200" end="00:05:01.030" style="s2">can start when I first started it would</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.660" end="00:05:02.620" style="s2">for me the real rep if I can speak about</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.030" end="00:05:05.110" style="s2">myself for a second the real revelation</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.620" end="00:05:07.690" style="s2">was oh my gosh this is a whole system</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.110" end="00:05:09.220" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean the holes you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.690" end="00:05:11.800" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me kind of be snarky about</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.220" end="00:05:13.300" style="s2">it it&#39;s taking it&#39;s not taking the SDGs</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.800" end="00:05:15.400" style="s2">and putting them in a circle and calling</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.300" end="00:05:17.590" style="s2">it a hole that&#39;s not a hole hmm</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.400" end="00:05:21.370" style="s2">it&#39;s or lead points and putting it in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.590" end="00:05:23.830" style="s2">circle it&#39;s still a list in a circle and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.370" end="00:05:26.410" style="s2">that&#39;s okay but what is really working</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.830" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">with a hole mean and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.410" end="00:05:31.570" style="s2">principles that I think what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:33.760" style="s2">get out there are the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.570" end="00:05:35.410" style="s2">because I think if we the way Carol&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.760" end="00:05:37.780" style="s2">characterize it I characterizing them</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.410" end="00:05:40.030" style="s2">five character Carol characterizes them</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.780" end="00:05:42.010" style="s2">in seven doesn&#39;t matter as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.030" end="00:05:44.440" style="s2">have those core principles they&#39;re to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.010" end="00:05:46.810" style="s2">get people to think about because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.440" end="00:05:52.650" style="s2">have to hold all seven together or I</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.810" end="00:05:59.730" style="s2">prefer five actually wholeness essence</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.650" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">reciprocity potential not problems</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.730" end="00:06:09.400" style="s2">developmental and missing that&#39;s fine I</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:11.400" style="s2">know that&#39;s five I combined I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.400" end="00:06:13.270" style="s2">throw it throw nodal in there and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.400" end="00:06:14.350" style="s2">knodel&#39;s the one that I would actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.270" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">get rid of because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.350" end="00:06:17.800" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:19.360" style="s2">Carol calls it as a Carol thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.800" end="00:06:21.940" style="s2">essential for change but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.360" end="00:06:23.770" style="s2">essential for the way a living system</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.940" end="00:06:27.130" style="s2">works is my opinion we should actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.770" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">talk about that let me say wholeness</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.130" end="00:06:32.669" style="s2">essence potential developmental</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.050" end="00:06:46.250" style="s2">reciprocity or field building knodel and</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.720" end="00:06:46.250" style="s2">I&#39;m missing one anyway yeah sir does</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.699" end="00:06:51.780" style="s2">well maybe speak to if you could speak</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.289" end="00:06:54.389" style="s2">to each one of them briefly then that</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.780" end="00:06:57.210" style="s2">the seventh one will pop back as you do</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.389" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">that there I can I&#39;ll just pop into this</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.210" end="00:07:00.020" style="s2">for a second</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.990" end="00:07:09.539" style="s2">nice picture what do you look at that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.599" end="00:07:11.569" style="s2">picture of you and at a conference or</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.539" end="00:07:11.569" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.169" end="00:07:22.139" style="s2">Oh nested this for me that&#39;s so key that</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.169" end="00:07:24.180" style="s2">for me scale linking the scale linking</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.139" end="00:07:27.590" style="s2">understanding of participation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.180" end="00:07:30.840" style="s2">wholeness was something that I felt was</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.590" end="00:07:34.259" style="s2">why I resonated so strongly with a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.840" end="00:07:36.650" style="s2">of the Regenesis work because that sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.259" end="00:07:40.259" style="s2">of I came in more from a complexity</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.650" end="00:07:43.409" style="s2">angle and yeah and a life science like</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.259" end="00:07:46.169" style="s2">being a biologist and that that nested</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.409" end="00:07:49.020" style="s2">Ness is it strike it&#39;s gigantic cuz she</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.169" end="00:07:50.550" style="s2">because and and the parent so also I</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.020" end="00:07:53.310" style="s2">would add another one to this just</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.550" end="00:07:55.020" style="s2">because I for me its meaningful when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.310" end="00:07:58.409" style="s2">find you&#39;re working with paradox you</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.020" end="00:08:00.389" style="s2">know you&#39;re on the right track so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.409" end="00:08:02.610" style="s2">paradox of nested miss is as Bucky</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.389" end="00:08:04.020" style="s2">fuller said you know we&#39;ve got to draw a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.610" end="00:08:05.580" style="s2">boundary and then you erase it because</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.020" end="00:08:07.469" style="s2">it&#39;s a figment of your imagination so</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.580" end="00:08:11.879" style="s2">you&#39;re continually iterating with this</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.469" end="00:08:13.289" style="s2">living right almost so that getting back</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.879" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">to personal development you can start</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.289" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">with a hole and the hole asks you will</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:18.930" style="s2">know how do we work with the hole once</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:21.509" style="s2">we understand that essence right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.930" end="00:08:24.419" style="s2">because that&#39;s key is essence in essence</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.509" end="00:08:27.150" style="s2">is so key and from the Western mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.419" end="00:08:29.940" style="s2">anyway so how do you work with that</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.150" end="00:08:32.279" style="s2">well it means I&#39;ve got to be actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:34.140" style="s2">have a group actualization skills I have</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.279" end="00:08:35.849" style="s2">to actually have group development</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.140" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">skills integration skills right to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.849" end="00:08:40.050" style="s2">able do that in order for me to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:42.300" style="s2">effective as a group if I&#39;m a jerk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.050" end="00:08:45.149" style="s2">not going to work very well yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.300" end="00:08:47.279" style="s2">all those it&#39;s just so beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.149" end="00:08:48.120" style="s2">that you you cannot do this without</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.279" end="00:08:50.790" style="s2">personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.120" end="00:08:52.529" style="s2">and the gigantic problem that I have in</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.790" end="00:08:56.400" style="s2">my work my particular consulting was</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.529" end="00:08:57.900" style="s2">Daniel is that people they hear the word</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.400" end="00:09:01.020" style="s2">regeneration I think this might speak to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:04.529" style="s2">some of your concerns because it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.020" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">a concern of mine is that people say</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.529" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">well oh this regeneration sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:09.450" style="s2">you know they want to they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:11.339" style="s2">well-meaning right they want to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.450" end="00:09:13.320" style="s2">sustainability at the best level they</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.339" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">can they want to leave a legacy behind</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.320" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">because they&#39;ve screwed up things in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">past or they believe in systems or</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:22.740" style="s2">something so they hire us but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:27.600" style="s2">they&#39;re hiring us to deliver a project</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.740" end="00:09:30.089" style="s2">hmm and that&#39;s an outcome of the process</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.600" end="00:09:31.560" style="s2">it is not the reason for the process but</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.089" end="00:09:34.620" style="s2">it&#39;s not the nature of the process the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.560" end="00:09:36.540" style="s2">process is about our evolution and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.620" end="00:09:38.430" style="s2">how we evolve with that splice that</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.540" end="00:09:40.920" style="s2">we&#39;re building this project in and how</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.430" end="00:09:42.779" style="s2">that place and system informs the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.920" end="00:09:44.970" style="s2">project and in order to do that we have</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.779" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">to change our attitude who we who we are</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.970" end="00:09:48.210" style="s2">in order to work with a community in a</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.210" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">ecosystem in a different way in order to</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.070" end="00:09:57.950" style="s2">inform that project well that personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:10:01.170" style="s2">development angle when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.950" end="00:10:04.850" style="s2">the fractal of what of who I am will</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.170" end="00:10:07.560" style="s2">help realize what the earth is to become</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.850" end="00:10:09.029" style="s2">is gigantic because if we don&#39;t leave</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.560" end="00:10:12.029" style="s2">people with that then it&#39;s not going to</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.850" end="00:10:56.790" style="s2">yeah the it but it takes them a year to</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.730" end="00:10:58.800" style="s2">process that stuff and they say oh they</p>

<p begin="00:11:10.160" end="00:11:15.830" style="s2">impact in X amount of time yeah well but</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.150" end="00:11:18.080" style="s2">of course it all goes hand at hand the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.830" end="00:11:19.970" style="s2">KPI should can be there the whole the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.080" end="00:11:21.980" style="s2">whole mechanics function needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.970" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">there but it needs to be accompanied by</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.790" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">out there that needs to happen so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:48.980" style="s2">very difficult from a functional world</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:50.360" style="s2">and especially in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.980" end="00:11:53.390" style="s2">which is why the United States is our</p>

<p begin="00:12:08.360" end="00:12:17.060" style="s2">hmm so how do we introduce this in such</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.410" end="00:12:19.610" style="s2">a way that they realize this they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:32.120" style="s2">old that you start really discovering</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.510" end="00:14:33.620" style="s2">rediscovering you know you&#39;d say I used</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.120" end="00:14:35.690" style="s2">to love that or this is what I used to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.620" end="00:14:38.389" style="s2">do but my father didn&#39;t let me do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.690" end="00:14:40.370" style="s2">right or something and realize well that</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.389" end="00:14:43.160" style="s2">was bad on him and bad on me it&#39;s time</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.370" end="00:14:46.370" style="s2">to rebirth that yeah and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.160" end="00:14:49.850" style="s2">the amount of self limiting beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.370" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">we carry from childhood is phenomenal I</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.850" end="00:14:55.819" style="s2">still have them yeah Tim you I think we</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:57.350" style="s2">all do it I think that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.819" end="00:15:00.500" style="s2">personal development journey is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.350" end="00:15:02.930" style="s2">really it&#39;s it&#39;s one step to become</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.500" end="00:15:06.949" style="s2">aware of them takes another 10 years to</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.930" end="00:15:09.529" style="s2">actually do something and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.949" end="00:15:13.130" style="s2">makes this work so powerful yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.529" end="00:15:15.319" style="s2">you&#39;re rebirthing yeah so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.130" end="00:15:18.350" style="s2">regenerating out there it&#39;s regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.319" end="00:15:19.339" style="s2">at all those nested levels right this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.350" end="00:15:21.709" style="s2">really interesting because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.339" end="00:15:25.970" style="s2">another thing that I increasingly get to</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.709" end="00:15:27.080" style="s2">and when when people ask me about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.970" end="00:15:29.779" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.080" end="00:15:34.339" style="s2">and for me in the notion of regeneration</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.779" end="00:15:37.370" style="s2">is also an invitation to meet breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.339" end="00:15:42.310" style="s2">collapse and the the dissolution of</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.370" end="00:15:45.589" style="s2">patterns that no longer serve em death</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.310" end="00:15:47.480" style="s2">something that loses its sting because</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.589" end="00:15:49.779" style="s2">you really understand the nested</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.480" end="00:15:51.740" style="s2">wholeness of life being fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.779" end="00:15:53.959" style="s2">interconnected and really just one</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.740" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">process and all boundaries including the</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.959" end="00:16:01.300" style="s2">one of scale truth ego just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.110" end="00:16:06.250" style="s2">Carterville I am you and you are me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.300" end="00:16:11.390" style="s2">you that&#39;s this is the journey and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.250" end="00:16:12.890" style="s2">this is why this practice is is unlearn</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.390" end="00:16:16.070" style="s2">herbal right I mean because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.890" end="00:16:18.769" style="s2">learning it&#39;s a continual evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.070" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">discovery of self and what any universe</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.769" end="00:16:27.410" style="s2">mmm-hmm yeah I know I was reminded in</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:30.500" style="s2">terms of historian with one of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.410" end="00:16:32.360" style="s2">clients and it&#39;s whether we got to the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.500" end="00:16:35.000" style="s2">Commonwealth project that Ben is doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.360" end="00:16:38.920" style="s2">such wonderful work still offering his</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.000" end="00:16:41.060" style="s2">services to I know Dan&#39;s been yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.920" end="00:16:46.790" style="s2">commit something happens coming out of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.060" end="00:16:49.579" style="s2">that well I really found I he explained</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.790" end="00:16:51.410" style="s2">to me how he sees it and since then I</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.579" end="00:16:54.200" style="s2">see it very differently would well</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.410" end="00:16:56.060" style="s2">because he at the last meeting again I</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.200" end="00:16:58.190" style="s2">was sort of looking at what had actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.060" end="00:16:59.750" style="s2">moved and whether the these the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.190" end="00:17:02.600" style="s2">potential that we all saw in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.750" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">beginning of somehow affecting the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.600" end="00:17:08.179" style="s2">that development is done in 53 nations</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:10.870" style="s2">around the world I&#39;m touching 2.4</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.179" end="00:17:15.260" style="s2">billion people at all it&#39;s all very ah</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.870" end="00:17:18.740" style="s2">what a great opportunity but um been</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.260" end="00:17:23.870" style="s2">said to me for him the most important</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.740" end="00:17:26.390" style="s2">and confirmed outcome of it all is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.870" end="00:17:30.140" style="s2">learning that Freya Yost has done in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.390" end="00:17:31.820" style="s2">process of him mentoring her to run the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.140" end="00:17:33.830" style="s2">the project and and that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.820" end="00:17:36.410" style="s2">because that also speaks to the levels</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.830" end="00:17:38.720" style="s2">of work because ultimately that is she</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.410" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">already did such wonderful work before</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.720" end="00:17:43.409" style="s2">she started with corpus from</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:49.110" style="s2">and started to work on common earth and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.409" end="00:17:51.830" style="s2">and now to have deepened under Ben&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.110" end="00:17:54.480" style="s2">mentor egde into this way of working</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.830" end="00:17:57.780" style="s2">it&#39;s guaranteed that for the rest of her</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.480" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">life she will do amazing stuff and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.780" end="00:18:01.409" style="s2">and that might say that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:04.380" style="s2">deliverable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.409" end="00:18:08.309" style="s2">the deliverable is capability mmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.380" end="00:18:10.440" style="s2">capacity and capability and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.309" end="00:18:12.690" style="s2">before my class from the school what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.440" end="00:18:14.730" style="s2">interesting capacity and capability and</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.690" end="00:18:17.010" style="s2">the answer is I asked them I said did</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.730" end="00:18:18.870" style="s2">you have the capacity to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.010" end="00:18:21.390" style="s2">I was talking about before we started</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.870" end="00:18:22.980" style="s2">this course well they had the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.390" end="00:18:26.039" style="s2">but I couldn&#39;t know they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.980" end="00:18:27.870" style="s2">understand Natalie now you have now that</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.039" end="00:18:32.490" style="s2">you had the capacity you have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.870" end="00:18:36.780" style="s2">capability to evolve mm-hmm something</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.490" end="00:18:39.570" style="s2">along those lines so when we leave the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.780" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">deliverable for a regenerative project</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.570" end="00:18:46.140" style="s2">is building the capacity and capability</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.640" end="00:18:50.490" style="s2">of people to co-evolved period that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.140" end="00:18:51.990" style="s2">with Nate that&#39;s exactly right with each</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.490" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">other that&#39;s that&#39;s why I stopped just</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.990" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">co-evolve as coevolution requires the</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:19:01.409" style="s2">whole us care person-to-person person</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:02.940" style="s2">the group person the nature because</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.409" end="00:19:07.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the other bit with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.940" end="00:19:09.539" style="s2">essence like am i right in seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.320" end="00:19:12.990" style="s2">what what I call bio cultural uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.539" end="00:19:16.490" style="s2">of place is very similar to essence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.990" end="00:19:19.500" style="s2">place like it&#39;s just it&#39;s both the</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.490" end="00:19:23.690" style="s2">specific uniqueness of that ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.500" end="00:19:29.880" style="s2">and its history but also the culture and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.690" end="00:19:32.460" style="s2">the potential that is held in gel</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.880" end="00:19:34.669" style="s2">absolutely leading up to a possibility</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.460" end="00:19:37.890" style="s2">of transformation and and whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.669" end="00:19:40.590" style="s2">realized or not yeah i mean i think i</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.890" end="00:19:42.870" style="s2">think biocultural is a fine term i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.590" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">though it typically gets Bane alized I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.870" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">hold on I&#39;m just gonna make it across</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:49.280" style="s2">this intersection here before Mike turns</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.560" end="00:20:05.470" style="s2">okay perfect so in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:06.520" style="s2">because you made mention earlier in our</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.470" end="00:20:08.940" style="s2">conversation you mentioned climate</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.520" end="00:20:08.940" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.090" end="00:20:17.800" style="s2">late last year seems to have been a year</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.150" end="00:20:20.230" style="s2">where so many people have woken up to a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.800" end="00:20:24.820" style="s2">new urgency around climate change to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.230" end="00:20:28.210" style="s2">point that not enough people that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:30.790" style="s2">doing that almost we&#39;re living the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.210" end="00:20:34.120" style="s2">shortcoming of allopathic medicine and</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.790" end="00:20:36.100" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re all like fighting as if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.120" end="00:20:38.560" style="s2">a cancer or whatever you want to call it</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.100" end="00:20:41.860" style="s2">and we&#39;re fighting this this anathema of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.560" end="00:20:45.340" style="s2">climate change using all these bellicose</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.860" end="00:20:49.540" style="s2">language and all that um but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.340" end="00:20:52.150" style="s2">really asking what&#39;s the cause of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.540" end="00:20:54.280" style="s2">symptom that&#39;s exactly right is climate</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.150" end="00:20:56.140" style="s2">change exactly that&#39;s what I tell people</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.280" end="00:20:59.110" style="s2">I say the same thing Daniel I say</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.140" end="00:21:02.200" style="s2">climate change is a symptom mm-hmm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.110" end="00:21:04.330" style="s2">not the issue and the issue is our</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.200" end="00:21:06.730" style="s2">disconnection the issue is our</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.330" end="00:21:08.920" style="s2">fragmentation of the world and even</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.730" end="00:21:10.390" style="s2">treating climate change is a problem it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.920" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">is not gonna is not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.390" end="00:21:15.040" style="s2">exactly because we saw him climb solve</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:20.350" style="s2">climate change let&#39;s say cold fusion to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.040" end="00:21:22.420" style="s2">somehow and realize tomorrow we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.350" end="00:21:24.220" style="s2">destroying the planet ma&#39;am for me for</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.420" end="00:21:26.380" style="s2">me that was always I mean good thing is</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.220" end="00:21:29.050" style="s2">with cold fusion that it&#39;s been 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.380" end="00:21:32.530" style="s2">away for for more than 40 years and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.050" end="00:21:34.540" style="s2">still 40 years away store and um but but</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.530" end="00:21:36.250" style="s2">I always felt and I remember this like</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.540" end="00:21:38.800" style="s2">when I was in a Center for alternative</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.250" end="00:21:41.740" style="s2">technology in the early 2000s and we</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.800" end="00:21:44.020" style="s2">always talked about how even if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.740" end="00:21:48.490" style="s2">discovered one of those Magic Bullet</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.020" end="00:21:50.740" style="s2">technologies and we probably then for</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.490" end="00:21:53.050" style="s2">sure destroy the planet because we</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.740" end="00:21:55.140" style="s2">haven&#39;t done the deeper work of</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.050" end="00:21:57.720" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.140" end="00:22:00.179" style="s2">the misguided Ness that has come from</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.370" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">much concluded in a report through the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.070" end="00:24:37.620" style="s2">White House that if we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:42.330" style="s2">fundamentally change our way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.620" end="00:24:45.659" style="s2">things by the mid-1990s then by the 2030</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.330" end="00:24:48.230" style="s2">is somewhere between 2030 and 2050 four</p>

<p begin="00:24:48.230" end="00:24:54.510" style="s2">and everything that if you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.289" end="00:24:56.639" style="s2">hard science they were right back then</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.510" end="00:24:59.100" style="s2">we haven&#39;t changed anything since then</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.639" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">oh and we&#39;re pretty much on course for</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.100" end="00:25:04.620" style="s2">something as traumatic as that and well</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:07.830" style="s2">look at outlook at Australia yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.620" end="00:25:09.899" style="s2">California but how do we go on like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.830" end="00:25:11.100" style="s2">from weapons that&#39;s the question and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.899" end="00:25:12.360" style="s2">working on that and believe me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.100" end="00:25:15.690" style="s2">spending a lot of time thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.360" end="00:25:18.450" style="s2">that and not maybe not effectively but</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.690" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve actually put a couple lets talk</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.450" end="00:25:27.649" style="s2">because I put a couple things in motion</p>

<p begin="00:25:31.289" end="00:25:36.029" style="s2">out of the talking to the choir Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.909" end="00:25:38.279" style="s2">yeah which is one reason I don&#39;t spend a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.029" end="00:25:40.620" style="s2">whole lot of time on regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.279" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">consciousness and I loved seeing your</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.620" end="00:25:49.139" style="s2">posts and all that but we all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:51.320" style="s2">get it right who&#39;s ready to listen who</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.139" end="00:25:54.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and so I&#39;m spending my time</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.320" end="00:25:57.809" style="s2">networking with business groups who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.440" end="00:25:59.850" style="s2">interested you know so this is one group</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.809" end="00:26:02.159" style="s2">out of Chicago called Nexus there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.850" end="00:26:05.879" style="s2">of Nexus is this is an another Nexus</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.159" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">group founded by a brilliant physicist</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.879" end="00:26:10.570" style="s2">who&#39;s actually and may change physics as</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:14.139" style="s2">we know it and he&#39;s also a multi male</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.570" end="00:26:16.330" style="s2">and he lives to network and he lives to</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.139" end="00:26:17.889" style="s2">introduce and so he basically finds</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.330" end="00:26:21.220" style="s2">people who are doing work around</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.889" end="00:26:24.120" style="s2">sustainability who are kind and loving</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.529" end="00:26:30.850" style="s2">work in sustainability so through</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.690" end="00:26:33.730" style="s2">whatever mechanism I&#39;ve been invited to</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.850" end="00:26:38.220" style="s2">become part of that group and it is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.730" end="00:26:41.860" style="s2">amazing group of brilliant people</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.220" end="00:26:43.659" style="s2">through that he he asked me to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.860" end="00:26:45.669" style="s2">the next conference to actually run the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.659" end="00:26:49.179" style="s2">next conference with another guy named</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.669" end="00:26:55.629" style="s2">Paul Stoltz who run who does something</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.179" end="00:26:58.990" style="s2">called the adversity quotient and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.629" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">yeah I never heard of it but it&#39;s he</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.990" end="00:27:04.210" style="s2">said basically he&#39;s a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:08.019" style="s2">neuroscientist organizational</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.210" end="00:27:09.669" style="s2">development guy and this is now taught</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.019" end="00:27:10.360" style="s2">at Harvard and MIT and around the world</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.669" end="00:27:14.169" style="s2">we&#39;ve got business he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.360" end="00:27:16.600" style="s2">multi-millionaire instead of IQ which</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.169" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really indicate much about</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.600" end="00:27:23.289" style="s2">success IQs intelligent quotients is</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:25.570" style="s2">kind of a bullshit indicator what he</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.289" end="00:27:28.919" style="s2">found out is people who handle adversity</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.570" end="00:27:32.019" style="s2">well are the people who are successful</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.919" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">so he&#39;s developed a battery of tests and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.019" end="00:27:36.220" style="s2">ways to improve your adversity quotient</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:39.750" style="s2">which by the way is so I stopped them</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.220" end="00:27:42.940" style="s2">and I said wait a minute let me just</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.750" end="00:27:46.330" style="s2">explain this work that I&#39;m hearing from</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.940" end="00:27:47.830" style="s2">our perspective I talked about you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.330" end="00:27:49.629" style="s2">internal locus of control and external</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.830" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">considering and internal locus an</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.629" end="00:27:53.490" style="s2">external locus of control internal</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:55.539" style="s2">considering and South Oregon is itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.490" end="00:27:59.080" style="s2">observing and self remembering and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.539" end="00:27:59.559" style="s2">said exactly that&#39;s the same stuff there</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.080" end="00:28:03.279" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.559" end="00:28:05.710" style="s2">I get it so I challenged him I said so</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.279" end="00:28:07.450" style="s2">you&#39;re working on our individual and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.710" end="00:28:09.250" style="s2">does business all over the world Daniel</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.450" end="00:28:11.470" style="s2">because there are businesses out there</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.250" end="00:28:13.570" style="s2">who and what I&#39;m cut what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.470" end="00:28:15.610" style="s2">captivating about is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.570" end="00:28:18.100" style="s2">business that are businesses many many</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.610" end="00:28:19.510" style="s2">many businesses we&#39;re saying yes we know</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.100" end="00:28:23.529" style="s2">it is about our own development</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.510" end="00:28:24.500" style="s2">that&#39;s gigantic if I can so I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.529" end="00:28:26.240" style="s2">so I flew out</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.500" end="00:28:28.970" style="s2">to California to meet with them just two</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.240" end="00:28:31.789" style="s2">weeks ago to see if there was some way</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.970" end="00:28:35.030" style="s2">that we confuse into a kind of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.789" end="00:28:36.919" style="s2">new platform what he&#39;s doing as an entry</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.030" end="00:28:41.830" style="s2">point and our work and second and third</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.919" end="00:28:44.299" style="s2">line work and whole systems work somehow</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.830" end="00:28:46.370" style="s2">introduced this in a different way to</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.299" end="00:28:50.030" style="s2">the world instead of hanging your hat on</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.370" end="00:28:52.130" style="s2">regeneration we hang it on I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.030" end="00:28:54.710" style="s2">something some new fusion but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.130" end="00:28:56.000" style="s2">the level of adversity quotient and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.710" end="00:28:58.070" style="s2">don&#39;t know come up with something new I</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.000" end="00:29:01.010" style="s2">don&#39;t want to collapse it into just that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.070" end="00:29:06.409" style="s2">domain that dimension so anyway that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.010" end="00:29:08.539" style="s2">something that I&#39;m exploring hmm and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.409" end="00:29:10.190" style="s2">other is is that with this found this</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.539" end="00:29:12.380" style="s2">physicist that founded Nexus just</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.190" end="00:29:16.400" style="s2">brought me an email yesterday and said</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.380" end="00:29:21.590" style="s2">he feels that the resources that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.400" end="00:29:26.150" style="s2">available in Nexus need to be focused on</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.590" end="00:29:28.100" style="s2">regenerative work so I wrote back and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.150" end="00:29:28.640" style="s2">said that&#39;s kind of an answer to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.100" end="00:29:33.169" style="s2">prayer</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.640" end="00:29:35.390" style="s2">let&#39;s see what we can this is certainly</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.169" end="00:29:40.190" style="s2">something that is happening also in the</p>

<p begin="00:30:28.850" end="00:30:33.530" style="s2">it differently and and and very often I</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.120" end="00:30:35.419" style="s2">get very friendly while this may have</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.530" end="00:30:36.750" style="s2">been a very useful conversation and I</p>

<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:45.930" style="s2">ultimately I&#39;m now stressed in getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:47.610" style="s2">my paid work done because I choose but</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.930" end="00:30:50.040" style="s2">anyway I&#39;m getting sidetracked here well</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.590" end="00:31:06.270" style="s2">story that I was building up towards and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.570" end="00:31:09.000" style="s2">in October I got contacted by somebody</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.270" end="00:31:12.150" style="s2">who initially I was tempted to say no to</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.000" end="00:31:13.980" style="s2">and then I had one of the most wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.150" end="00:31:17.060" style="s2">conversations I&#39;ve had all of last year</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.980" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">with him connecting in a really deep way</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.060" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">so very much on a personal note and long</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">story short I was invited to Switzerland</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:30.990" style="s2">to a meeting that was about helping to</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:33.480" style="s2">bring more funding into large ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.990" end="00:31:36.180" style="s2">restoration projects and I&#39;m right that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.480" end="00:31:39.420" style="s2">are fundamentally community focused and</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.180" end="00:31:42.270" style="s2">based that are all about drawing I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.420" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">basically place sourced in in Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.270" end="00:31:50.520" style="s2">language and they brought 24 of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:51.960" style="s2">together and half of the group or</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.520" end="00:31:54.060" style="s2">slightly more than half of the group</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.960" end="00:31:58.140" style="s2">were from the funding and philanthropy</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.060" end="00:32:00.990" style="s2">and an impact investment world and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.140" end="00:32:03.500" style="s2">is the smaller half were were people</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.990" end="00:32:06.930" style="s2">like William Farina from common land or</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.500" end="00:32:08.730" style="s2">Philippa vieja from renature so people</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.930" end="00:32:12.980" style="s2">who had foundations that are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.730" end="00:32:16.290" style="s2">kind of work out there and and it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.980" end="00:32:21.390" style="s2">like the Omidyar Network like the eBay</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.290" end="00:32:24.340" style="s2">people and and IKEA Foundation and very</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.390" end="00:32:26.000" style="s2">big like the like alcohols investment</p>

<p begin="00:32:26.000" end="00:32:36.660" style="s2">system like like investment fund there</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.300" end="00:32:40.410" style="s2">are just huge amounts of money wanting</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.660" end="00:32:43.140" style="s2">to be poured into restoring damaged</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.410" end="00:32:46.650" style="s2">ecosystems restoring or regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.140" end="00:32:48.630" style="s2">damaged communities and really that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.650" end="00:32:50.310" style="s2">money is there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.630" end="00:32:50.690" style="s2">the issue that I again and this comes</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.310" end="00:32:53.540" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.690" end="00:32:56.590" style="s2">- how do we keep the depth of the work</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.540" end="00:33:00.740" style="s2">and put the personal and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.590" end="00:33:03.350" style="s2">consciousness and personal shift of re</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.740" end="00:33:05.360" style="s2">relating of Riyadh yeah I think it I</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.350" end="00:33:07.250" style="s2">Center just to give you a quick answer I</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.360" end="00:33:08.660" style="s2">think it&#39;s a branding issue day and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.250" end="00:33:11.270" style="s2">know and I think the I think the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.660" end="00:33:13.330" style="s2">principles are really powerful in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.270" end="00:33:16.730" style="s2">regard I think we just have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.330" end="00:33:18.560" style="s2">driving home principles and what and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.730" end="00:33:20.000" style="s2">then people will ask a question you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.560" end="00:33:23.540" style="s2">people don&#39;t learn until they&#39;re willing</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.000" end="00:33:26.660" style="s2">to ask a question and so our job is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.540" end="00:33:29.540" style="s2">keep pushing stuff out there not to add</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.660" end="00:33:31.340" style="s2">a gently gently destabilizing way which</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.540" end="00:33:34.550" style="s2">is by the way but why we use the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.340" end="00:33:36.440" style="s2">language we use mm-hmm is to is so that</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.550" end="00:33:38.330" style="s2">people are not assuming they understand</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.440" end="00:33:42.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is if they assume</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.330" end="00:33:43.400" style="s2">they understand they don&#39;t need you if</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.080" end="00:33:45.770" style="s2">they actually well what does that word</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.400" end="00:33:47.780" style="s2">mean or you&#39;re using it in a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.770" end="00:33:52.400" style="s2">different sense how come you said that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.780" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">okay that&#39;s you don&#39;t and and you notice</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.400" end="00:33:56.600" style="s2">that that I always have a story</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:58.910" style="s2">associated with words I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.600" end="00:34:00.980" style="s2">you noticed that but I I try to do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.910" end="00:34:04.190" style="s2">so that people actually can then image</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.980" end="00:34:05.450" style="s2">that in a new way mm-hmm no you</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.190" end="00:34:06.920" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t list let the words hang out</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.450" end="00:34:10.130" style="s2">there and be a jerk about it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.920" end="00:34:13.100" style="s2">that&#39;s jargon you know that&#39;s jargon</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.130" end="00:34:14.660" style="s2">abuse but but jargon is very important</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.100" end="00:34:19.370" style="s2">because when it&#39;s precise it actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.660" end="00:34:21.020" style="s2">has a unique meaning and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.370" end="00:34:22.460" style="s2">the mission so I think instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.020" end="00:34:24.170" style="s2">talking about regeneration all the time</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.460" end="00:34:26.660" style="s2">we actually have to start defining the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.170" end="00:34:30.530" style="s2">boundaries or the that&#39;s the wrong word</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.660" end="00:34:32.030" style="s2">but the principles of regeneration in</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.530" end="00:34:34.160" style="s2">that context so that people start going</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.030" end="00:34:36.770" style="s2">diving deeper like in regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.160" end="00:34:38.240" style="s2">consciousness that work could be great</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.770" end="00:34:39.680" style="s2">to start using those principles and</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.240" end="00:34:41.630" style="s2">having a deeper debate about that</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.680" end="00:34:43.880" style="s2">because I know that many of the people</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.630" end="00:34:45.680" style="s2">on that list sir are at that very</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.880" end="00:34:50.960" style="s2">sensitive level about understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.680" end="00:34:52.640" style="s2">need to be whole and certainly working</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.960" end="00:34:54.590" style="s2">with nature on its own terms</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.640" end="00:34:58.310" style="s2">what does that require of us and how do</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.590" end="00:35:00.860" style="s2">we expand that then but I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.310" end="00:35:04.040" style="s2">that with my work in social media look</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.860" end="00:35:05.330" style="s2">whether it&#39;s the regenerative and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.040" end="00:35:07.520" style="s2">cultures page or the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.330" end="00:35:10.070" style="s2">consciousness group and now we&#39;ve even</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.520" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">started a regenerative Action Network</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.070" end="00:35:17.540" style="s2">yeah I think I decided I was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:19.490" style="s2">yesterday and is that it&#39;s a it was bit</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.540" end="00:35:21.080" style="s2">disheartening for me to see some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.490" end="00:35:23.180" style="s2">comments because I realized how many</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.080" end="00:35:25.430" style="s2">people that that were on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.180" end="00:35:27.740" style="s2">very interested in all all of this are</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.430" end="00:35:32.000" style="s2">still really strongly in the habit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.740" end="00:35:36.190" style="s2">other ring of just getting triggered by</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.000" end="00:35:41.300" style="s2">one or two comments that make people</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.190" end="00:35:43.850" style="s2">classify a person into a box and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.300" end="00:35:46.280" style="s2">respond to that box and basically say</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.850" end="00:35:48.500" style="s2">anybody who believes that is not one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.280" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">mine and so I&#39;m against the most like it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.500" end="00:35:55.550" style="s2">is immediately polarizing there and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:59.300" style="s2">and so for me these groups still have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.550" end="00:36:05.200" style="s2">long way to go to open a real embracing</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.300" end="00:36:08.930" style="s2">diversity valuing this force on on how</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.200" end="00:36:11.600" style="s2">how we can live the questions together</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.930" end="00:36:16.250" style="s2">would be my language yeah well love it</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.600" end="00:36:18.560" style="s2">loving each other to evolve is it and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.250" end="00:36:20.450" style="s2">mean that&#39;s why I still still put a</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.560" end="00:36:23.540" style="s2">significant amount of time into these</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.450" end="00:36:26.840" style="s2">these groups is then I do actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.540" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re not necessarily talking to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.840" end="00:36:31.670" style="s2">the choir it&#39;s just like people who have</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:33.560" style="s2">kind of begun to walk over a bridge but</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:37.490" style="s2">but but then they haven&#39;t crossed it yet</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.560" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">yes well that&#39;s true but but the quad I</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.490" end="00:36:41.720" style="s2">greet I agree with everything you just</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:43.700" style="s2">said and there&#39;s something I want to add</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.720" end="00:36:51.260" style="s2">to that and I&#39;m trying to get my way</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.700" end="00:36:53.360" style="s2">around it you know here another way to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.260" end="00:36:57.950" style="s2">say this is none of us are members of</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.360" end="00:37:01.640" style="s2">the choir and that and that we we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.950" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">developing right so maybe that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.640" end="00:37:07.850" style="s2">to say it is that are we all on this</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.800" end="00:37:29.510" style="s2">wanted to ask you just um I I read with</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.010" end="00:37:31.660" style="s2">a lot of what I learned in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.510" end="00:37:34.130" style="s2">regenerative practitioner there were</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.660" end="00:37:36.500" style="s2">moments where I felt that there there</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.130" end="00:37:38.180" style="s2">was a similarity with some of the work</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.500" end="00:37:40.130" style="s2">that I&#39;ve drawn from through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.180" end="00:37:43.730" style="s2">international futures forum particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.130" end="00:37:45.620" style="s2">Toni Hodgman and Bill sharp I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.730" end="00:37:47.930" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed the three horizons</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.620" end="00:37:50.600" style="s2">framework in the worlds systems model</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.930" end="00:37:53.500" style="s2">and and there&#39;s a there they&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.600" end="00:37:58.990" style="s2">curated a set at what they call</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.500" end="00:38:02.510" style="s2">generative methodologies and in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.990" end="00:38:05.590" style="s2">helping people to explore getting closer</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.510" end="00:38:08.930" style="s2">to what regeneration would would mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.590" end="00:38:11.990" style="s2">drawings heavily on on particularly</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.930" end="00:38:17.270" style="s2">Pamela and Ben&#39;s book or the Regenesis</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.990" end="00:38:19.940" style="s2">book em and they&#39;re fully aware that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.270" end="00:38:22.880" style="s2">there is this story that Regenesis holds</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.940" end="00:38:25.760" style="s2">this this very long curated process and</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.880" end="00:38:28.460" style="s2">lineage I would love to help to make</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.760" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">that bridge and I think bill bill would</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.460" end="00:38:33.110" style="s2">really appreciate if when it&#39;s with you</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.640" style="s2">or with the idea I&#39;d be I would be glad</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.110" end="00:38:36.590" style="s2">to do that in fact there was a guy in</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.640" end="00:38:38.390" style="s2">Wellington New Zealand who gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.590" end="00:38:40.730" style="s2">great article on the three horizons</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.390" end="00:38:42.440" style="s2">which helped open that up to me I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.730" end="00:38:45.770" style="s2">use some more of that I would love to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.440" end="00:38:47.630" style="s2">that Daniel see if I send a separate</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.770" end="00:38:52.520" style="s2">email but what I would love is like</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.630" end="00:38:54.830" style="s2">basically if bill could spend 30 35</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.520" end="00:38:56.930" style="s2">minutes presenting something to you Ben</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.830" end="00:38:59.330" style="s2">and Pamela and then just get your</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.930" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">feedback as honest as it comes like they</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.330" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">know like because he would really</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:06.110" style="s2">appreciate it and and I like he&#39;d go yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.780" style="s2">you can site you can sign me up for that</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.110" end="00:39:10.760" style="s2">mind off panel will be game she&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.780" end="00:39:13.340" style="s2">of she said her world at Ben I think Ben</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.760" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">might be really game for it so then I</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.340" end="00:39:16.760" style="s2">would be glad to do that I would</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.380" end="00:39:19.630" style="s2">certainly be glad to do that because I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.760" end="00:39:21.590" style="s2">am interested in the three horizons and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.630" end="00:39:24.140" style="s2">would like would like a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.590" end="00:39:26.600" style="s2">explanation is I I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.140" end="00:39:28.920" style="s2">this complementarity because I very</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.600" end="00:39:31.200" style="s2">strongly remember permanence</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.920" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">to me after the therapy we really want</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:35.160" style="s2">this work to be in constant development</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:37.410" style="s2">because that&#39;s it the essence of it that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.160" end="00:39:40.140" style="s2">it needs it as you just said so</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.410" end="00:39:42.810" style="s2">wonderfully and and then I felt it there</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.140" end="00:39:45.180" style="s2">was a little like I haven&#39;t found my way</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.810" end="00:39:47.220" style="s2">of how can I contribute to development</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.180" end="00:39:50.070" style="s2">like maybe it&#39;s because I still need to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.220" end="00:39:51.120" style="s2">do a lot more assimilating and learning</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.070" end="00:39:53.310" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.120" end="00:39:57.590" style="s2">no there well we&#39;re again we&#39;re all in</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.310" end="00:40:00.990" style="s2">that we&#39;re all in that boat but I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.590" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">this is a longer conversation where I</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.990" end="00:40:05.820" style="s2">and but but seriously Daniel a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:08.640" style="s2">percent I am really interested in three</p>
