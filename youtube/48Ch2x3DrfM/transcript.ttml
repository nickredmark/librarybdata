<p begin="00:02:05.710" end="00:02:11.620" style="s2">in order to hold something in mind so</p>

<p begin="00:02:11.620" end="00:02:20.200" style="s2">more in contact with it and then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.260" end="00:02:22.989" style="s2">argued the point of that is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.200" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">to set up an ANA gaagh Express by which</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.989" end="00:02:27.760" style="s2">I am transformed so I can see through</p>

<p begin="00:02:27.760" end="00:02:31.540" style="s2">and so that reality can speak through</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.540" end="00:02:37.209" style="s2">and that we get an Anna Gaga flow</p>

<p begin="00:02:37.209" end="00:02:42.069" style="s2">integrated the world is becoming</p>

<p begin="00:02:42.069" end="00:02:49.000" style="s2">realization feels deeply sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.190" end="00:02:52.720" style="s2">love coupling to reality in a profound</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.000" end="00:02:55.239" style="s2">way and so that symbols are in that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.720" end="00:02:57.010" style="s2">sense designed to get me into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.239" end="00:03:00.310" style="s2">trajectory of trance framing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.010" end="00:03:03.730" style="s2">designed to in wonder open up the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.310" end="00:03:09.940" style="s2">and also grow me so that I can be in</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.730" end="00:03:12.849" style="s2">that larger world and that points to how</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.940" end="00:03:14.859" style="s2">symbols are ecstatic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.849" end="00:03:16.900" style="s2">participatory they&#39;re integrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.859" end="00:03:20.260" style="s2">they&#39;re complex because they help to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.900" end="00:03:23.700" style="s2">complexify me and disclose the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.260" end="00:03:29.670" style="s2">complexity of the world in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.700" end="00:03:34.090" style="s2">fashion and then I suggested to you that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.670" end="00:03:36.310" style="s2">we understand symbols as mythos that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.090" end="00:03:39.220" style="s2">it&#39;s always a symbol and a story</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.310" end="00:03:42.040" style="s2">together and that the story points to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.220" end="00:03:43.449" style="s2">the ritual and the ritual is also right</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.040" end="00:03:46.750" style="s2">there because the mythos is always</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.449" end="00:03:49.239" style="s2">enacted if it&#39;s going to bring about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.750" end="00:03:53.980" style="s2">transformations that it wants to bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.239" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">about or that we want to use it to bring</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.980" end="00:03:58.440" style="s2">about I think both of those are right</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.550" end="00:04:13.720" style="s2">we can use mythos to activate accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.209" end="00:04:16.310" style="s2">articulate and appreciate religio</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.720" end="00:04:17.959" style="s2">religio is inherently valuable to us so</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.310" end="00:04:18.859" style="s2">even that alone is going to be very</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.959" end="00:04:21.560" style="s2">valuable to us</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.859" end="00:04:23.690" style="s2">but in addition the act of seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.560" end="00:04:26.120" style="s2">playing not only is it development of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.690" end="00:04:29.630" style="s2">what we are what we find intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.120" end="00:04:31.729" style="s2">valuable because it&#39;s constitutive of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.630" end="00:04:33.260" style="s2">our ability to value anything else or</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.729" end="00:04:38.030" style="s2">interact with anything we consider</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.260" end="00:04:39.590" style="s2">valuable because it&#39;s primordial not</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.030" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">only is that the case but relevance</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.590" end="00:04:42.830" style="s2">realization which is at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.180" end="00:04:50.300" style="s2">religion of giving your argument for</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.830" end="00:04:54.289" style="s2">that is constituted to it it functions</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.300" end="00:04:58.220" style="s2">it is structured to function it</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.289" end="00:05:00.560" style="s2">functions by being interested in itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.220" end="00:05:05.870" style="s2">correcting itself transcending itself</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.560" end="00:05:09.620" style="s2">developing itself so that&#39;s why we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.870" end="00:05:11.960" style="s2">love the flow state right it mark not</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.620" end="00:05:14.419" style="s2">only not only is it a optimal in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.960" end="00:05:16.669" style="s2">right this playing with religion like</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.419" end="00:05:19.160" style="s2">the flow state is not only optimal in</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.669" end="00:05:24.910" style="s2">that it&#39;s getting us to be our best we</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.160" end="00:05:27.560" style="s2">also find it to be an optimal experience</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.910" end="00:05:29.750" style="s2">because we&#39;re seriously playing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.560" end="00:05:31.900" style="s2">this intrinsically valuable machinery in</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.750" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">a way that is constitutively</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.900" end="00:05:36.580" style="s2">intrinsically significant to us</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.740" end="00:05:49.340" style="s2">and I propose that when we are using the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.210" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">symbol to get us to play with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.340" end="00:05:57.140" style="s2">machinery the meta assimilation the meta</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:06:00.110" style="s2">accommodation or sacredness or the least</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.140" end="00:06:01.700" style="s2">the meta assimilation the meta</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.110" end="00:06:06.250" style="s2">accommodation of the higher order</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.700" end="00:06:09.920" style="s2">relevance realization within sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.250" end="00:06:14.570" style="s2">and that&#39;s what we deeply mean by the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.920" end="00:06:19.040" style="s2">experience of sacredness and then I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.570" end="00:06:21.620" style="s2">propose to you a proposal I need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.040" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">return to now because I only initiated</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.620" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">it last time I propose to you that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:30.350" style="s2">move off of sacredness and on to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:32.660" style="s2">sacred in a particular proposal as to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.350" end="00:06:35.930" style="s2">what is the cause or the source of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.660" end="00:06:37.430" style="s2">sacredness the sacred and again I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.930" end="00:06:44.210" style="s2">using that term because it&#39;s as neutral</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.430" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">as I can find and the proposal which</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.210" end="00:06:51.200" style="s2">again you don&#39;t find in some accounts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:54.940" style="s2">sacredness the sacred that is the DAO I</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.200" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">do not think is supernatural or absolute</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.940" end="00:07:01.030" style="s2">the sacredness of Shunyata is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:04.940" style="s2">not right</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.030" end="00:07:07.190" style="s2">so when Prince Wu asked Bodhidharma what</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.940" end="00:07:08.300" style="s2">was you know what was wholly about his</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.190" end="00:07:10.730" style="s2">doctrine and he keeps pressing</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.300" end="00:07:12.230" style="s2">bodhidharma he keeps saying no no not</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.730" end="00:07:14.290" style="s2">that and then the Prince gets upset says</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.230" end="00:07:17.750" style="s2">well what is holy about your doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.290" end="00:07:21.650" style="s2">Bodhidharma says nothing holy vast</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.750" end="00:07:25.460" style="s2">emptiness Shunyata is in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.650" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">sacred but it&#39;s not holy at least not in</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.460" end="00:07:32.980" style="s2">the sense of you know a supernatural</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:32.980" style="s2">source of righteousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.889" end="00:07:38.879" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:46.650" style="s2">I proposed an alternative to that idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.259" end="00:07:49.449" style="s2">born from a critique the critique was</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.650" end="00:07:54.389" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.449" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">essential i&#39;s sacredness in the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.389" end="00:08:00.039" style="s2">right to say that that what that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:04.740" style="s2">source of sacredness is something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.039" end="00:08:08.199" style="s2">is essentially relevant to us absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.740" end="00:08:10.870" style="s2">unquestionably undeniably relevant to us</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.199" end="00:08:12.759" style="s2">and that it is the the culmination in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.870" end="00:08:18.070" style="s2">and the the or it is the origin and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.759" end="00:08:19.750" style="s2">culmination of relevance and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.070" end="00:08:22.180" style="s2">propose to you that that just struck me</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.750" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">ultimately and I do mean this with as</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.180" end="00:08:29.380" style="s2">much respect I mean this is I hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">regarded as a respectful criticism but</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.380" end="00:08:33.219" style="s2">nevertheless it&#39;s a Christmas I regard</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:41.520" style="s2">that as a category mistake relevance</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.219" end="00:08:45.000" style="s2">realization right is not about detecting</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.520" end="00:08:50.010" style="s2">finding something that&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.000" end="00:08:55.870" style="s2">relevant in the sense that it absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.010" end="00:08:59.649" style="s2">commands our attention relevance does</p>

<p begin="00:20:21.909" end="00:20:28.100" style="s2">understand the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.220" end="00:20:30.970" style="s2">connectedness and understand it in a way</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.399" end="00:20:46.249" style="s2">from the supernatural and its commitment</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.729" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">to a two worlds mythology instead</p>

<p begin="00:20:54.700" end="00:20:58.989" style="s2">because if you remember this is all</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.840" end="00:21:03.970" style="s2">grounded in a naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.989" end="00:21:07.489" style="s2">interpretation of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.970" end="00:21:11.029" style="s2">this would be an account that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.489" end="00:21:16.159" style="s2">situates us back within that scientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.029" end="00:21:21.460" style="s2">worldview well also giving us a way a</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.269" end="00:21:39.379" style="s2">finished I need to show how this model</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.739" end="00:21:43.940" style="s2">of relevance realization does address</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.940" end="00:21:48.919" style="s2">suggesting that to you but how does it</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.460" end="00:21:53.539" style="s2">help to address where we got to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.919" end="00:21:54.559" style="s2">historically the historical factors but</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.539" end="00:21:56.599" style="s2">there&#39;s another thing that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.559" end="00:21:58.309" style="s2">alluding to that we also have to address</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.599" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">and they are integrated together and now</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.309" end="00:22:05.539" style="s2">that I have this theoretical machinery I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:08.389" style="s2">can talk about it better because we now</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.539" end="00:22:11.799" style="s2">have I think a more careful way of</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.700" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">this marker is good</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.450" end="00:22:30.190" style="s2">so we have and we did this in the first</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.360" end="00:22:39.240" style="s2">off the series we have the historical</p>

<p begin="00:22:46.540" end="00:22:51.640" style="s2">course they need to be addressed and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:53.560" style="s2">part of how we can awaken from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.640" end="00:22:55.510" style="s2">meaning crisis is we have to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.560" end="00:22:57.550" style="s2">these historical factors we have to wet</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.510" end="00:23:01.120" style="s2">and we have to come up with a way of RER</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.550" end="00:23:06.490" style="s2">tickle aiding our worldview in which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.120" end="00:23:09.070" style="s2">can get back that sense of deep</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.490" end="00:23:11.940" style="s2">connectedness what I&#39;ve been calling in</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.070" end="00:23:14.370" style="s2">the last couple of lectures sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.940" end="00:23:20.740" style="s2">that kind of deep connectedness that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.370" end="00:23:25.710" style="s2">affords the satisfaction of our sense of</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.710" end="00:23:34.840" style="s2">self transcendence affords meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.800" end="00:23:36.820" style="s2">life in a profound way so can this view</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.840" end="00:23:38.430" style="s2">give us something analogous to what the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.820" end="00:23:40.930" style="s2">three orders we got to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.430" end="00:23:42.310" style="s2">that&#39;s how we respond to the historical</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.930" end="00:23:43.450" style="s2">factors but you&#39;re starting to see how</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.310" end="00:23:47.230" style="s2">it might do that we&#39;re starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.450" end="00:23:50.650" style="s2">how we can get an account of sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.230" end="00:23:52.450" style="s2">that can fit into the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.650" end="00:23:53.860" style="s2">worldview and fit us back into it we</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.450" end="00:23:55.480" style="s2">need to do more on that but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.860" end="00:23:56.890" style="s2">getting a beginning of that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.480" end="00:23:58.240" style="s2">something else now that&#39;s come that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.890" end="00:24:04.750" style="s2">coming to the fore that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.240" end="00:24:07.740" style="s2">address which is right the structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.750" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">functional analysis of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.740" end="00:24:11.680" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been calling the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.820" end="00:24:13.710" style="s2">analysis because I think that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.680" end="00:24:15.970" style="s2">in contrast to the historical analysis</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.710" end="00:24:17.440" style="s2">there&#39;s also disclosing something out</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.970" end="00:24:21.390" style="s2">and that we&#39;ve seen this all the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.440" end="00:24:25.230" style="s2">along and I&#39;ve been hinting at it</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.390" end="00:24:33.010" style="s2">because the machinery of meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.230" end="00:24:36.100" style="s2">of course also is the machinery that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.010" end="00:24:39.400" style="s2">going awry</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.100" end="00:24:41.700" style="s2">when people are experiencing a sense of</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.670" end="00:24:50.160" style="s2">remember the core argument that the very</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.880" end="00:24:51.960" style="s2">machining that makes you adaptive is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.160" end="00:24:54.120" style="s2">machinery that makes you vulnerable to</p>

<p begin="00:24:54.120" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">processing the very machinery of our our</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.490" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">us it&#39;s also the machinery that can go</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.620" end="00:25:18.830" style="s2">horribly wrong we&#39;ve already seen that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.580" end="00:25:28.710" style="s2">want to start talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.540" end="00:25:30.360" style="s2">perennial problems you&#39;ve seen examples</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.710" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">along the way but I want to bring them</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.360" end="00:25:36.450" style="s2">out more I want to develop that thesis</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:38.400" style="s2">about how the very machinery that makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.450" end="00:25:40.460" style="s2">us adaptive is the machinery that makes</p>

<p begin="00:25:50.870" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">here&#39;s what I want to argue I want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.499" end="00:26:00.980" style="s2">argue that all cultures all all people</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:03.080" style="s2">in the sense of being participants in</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.980" end="00:26:06.820" style="s2">their culture not necessarily every</p>

<p begin="00:26:11.840" end="00:26:21.080" style="s2">are prone to perennial problems these</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.769" end="00:26:24.619" style="s2">are ways in which the machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.080" end="00:26:34.369" style="s2">relevance realization can drive them</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.619" end="00:26:40.340" style="s2">into meaninglessness despair so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.369" end="00:26:43.149" style="s2">is that inherent in the machinery that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.340" end="00:26:46.100" style="s2">makes us adoptive is inescapable</p>

<p begin="00:27:25.460" end="00:27:29.179" style="s2">communities and multiple scales what</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.649" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">people have developed is they have</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.179" end="00:27:36.289" style="s2">developed sets of psycho technologies</p>

<p begin="00:32:12.770" end="00:32:19.890" style="s2">will not ultimately lead to ways in</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.930" end="00:32:21.870" style="s2">which you in your life can respond to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.890" end="00:32:24.900" style="s2">how the perennial problems might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.870" end="00:32:27.740" style="s2">gnawing away at the fabric of meaning in</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.000" end="00:32:36.260" style="s2">so I want to concentrate on that I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.310" end="00:32:43.550" style="s2">to concentrate on trying to</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.260" end="00:32:47.690" style="s2">reverse-engineer enlightenment and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.550" end="00:32:53.450" style="s2">if I can take that and situate it into</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.690" end="00:32:55.910" style="s2">this account of sacredness and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.450" end="00:32:59.030" style="s2">realization and show how that fits into</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.910" end="00:33:01.100" style="s2">our scientific worldview and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.030" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">how this is start pretending together</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.100" end="00:33:10.010" style="s2">then we have a way of awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:13.520" style="s2">meeting crisis not as an absolute final</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.010" end="00:33:15.350" style="s2">answer that&#39;s ridiculous but it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.520" end="00:33:16.760" style="s2">of maybe getting the process of</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.350" end="00:33:19.660" style="s2">awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.760" end="00:33:19.660" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.860" end="00:33:26.669" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.010" end="00:33:33.990" style="s2">let&#39;s think of relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.260" end="00:33:38.070" style="s2">religio we can think about there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.990" end="00:33:41.909" style="s2">functional aspect a structural aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.070" end="00:33:47.150" style="s2">course and a developmental all of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.909" end="00:33:47.150" style="s2">has been seen throughout this series</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:55.450" style="s2">of course the functional aspect is</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.230" end="00:33:58.570" style="s2">ultimately the relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.450" end="00:34:00.520" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of three central features</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.570" end="00:34:04.210" style="s2">the way it&#39;s which its self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.520" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">right and then there&#39;s aspects of self</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.210" end="00:34:12.030" style="s2">identification and self reflection</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.340" end="00:34:22.690" style="s2">the structural has to do with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.169" end="00:34:25.350" style="s2">meta meaning of the agent arena</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.690" end="00:34:25.350" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.399" end="00:34:39.730" style="s2">the developmental right I&#39;ll come back</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.519" end="00:34:41.649" style="s2">to because I need to unpack these more</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.730" end="00:34:44.369" style="s2">before I can talk more about that but</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.649" end="00:34:48.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve already seen how an intrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.369" end="00:34:51.639" style="s2">developmental relevance realization and</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.730" end="00:34:54.069" style="s2">religio are okay</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.639" end="00:34:58.720" style="s2">the self-organizing aspect how can that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.069" end="00:35:00.430" style="s2">go awry well I&#39;ve already made I think a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.720" end="00:35:08.950" style="s2">very good case for that for you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.430" end="00:35:18.369" style="s2">that&#39;s parasitic processing when we get</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.950" end="00:35:20.519" style="s2">into those complex cycles that take on a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.369" end="00:35:22.990" style="s2">life of their own and take life from us</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.519" end="00:35:29.140" style="s2">complex patterns of self deception and</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.990" end="00:35:31.210" style="s2">self destruction self identification</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.140" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">when we know what that is that&#39;s modal</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.210" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">confusion</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:48.529" style="s2">what about self reflection well I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.789" end="00:35:51.859" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about that very much so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.529" end="00:35:55.130" style="s2">need to talk about that now this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.859" end="00:36:03.529" style="s2">some important work done by bellman and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.130" end="00:36:04.670" style="s2">others so we have to go back again to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.529" end="00:36:07.250" style="s2">the work of Harry Frankfurt and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.670" end="00:36:09.829" style="s2">Frankfurt&#39;s notion of a wanton a wanton</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.250" end="00:36:13.220" style="s2">is a being who acts in a wanton fashion</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.829" end="00:36:15.170" style="s2">that acts completely impulsively and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.220" end="00:36:17.450" style="s2">the idea is if I just knocked completely</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.170" end="00:36:18.920" style="s2">impulsively I&#39;ll actually lose my agency</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.450" end="00:36:20.839" style="s2">because my impulses are often in</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.920" end="00:36:23.299" style="s2">conflict with each other they undermine</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.839" end="00:36:27.260" style="s2">each other we&#39;ll think about Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.299" end="00:36:29.180" style="s2">the inner conflict right so what I need</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.260" end="00:36:32.740" style="s2">to do is I need to step back and reflect</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.180" end="00:36:36.920" style="s2">in order to try and get the coordination</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.740" end="00:36:41.990" style="s2">and integration and reflection actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.920" end="00:36:43.520" style="s2">helps reduce my wantonness see when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.990" end="00:36:47.270" style="s2">in meshed in a perspective here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.520" end="00:36:50.029" style="s2">particular perspective right I am a</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.270" end="00:36:52.430" style="s2">meshed in its salience landscape how</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.029" end="00:36:54.819" style="s2">it&#39;s making me care how it&#39;s motivating</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.430" end="00:36:57.559" style="s2">and arousing me so when I&#39;m thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.819" end="00:37:00.619" style="s2">right when I&#39;m thirsty I&#39;m seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.559" end="00:37:03.230" style="s2">world thirstily right so things having</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.619" end="00:37:05.720" style="s2">to do with water and kindig um salient</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.230" end="00:37:09.260" style="s2">I&#39;m drawn in right that&#39;s to see the</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.260" end="00:37:18.740" style="s2">transparency opacity shift I can</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.720" end="00:37:22.359" style="s2">actually step to a different perspective</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.740" end="00:37:25.339" style="s2">in which I&#39;m aware of my thirst</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.359" end="00:37:27.950" style="s2">now I&#39;m not this perspective is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.339" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">thirsty this is thirsty but this</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.950" end="00:37:33.859" style="s2">perspective for example is curious oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">that&#39;s what thirst is like now my</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.859" end="00:37:39.289" style="s2">motivational machinery is not driven</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:43.970" style="s2">just by thirst it is driven by a carrier</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.289" end="00:37:48.529" style="s2">perhaps curiosity and what happens is I</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.970" end="00:37:51.970" style="s2">start to gain some relief from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.529" end="00:37:54.890" style="s2">compulsion of immediacy and urgency of</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.970" end="00:37:57.020" style="s2">my thirst I&#39;m using thirst by the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.890" end="00:37:59.799" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s also a metaphor in Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.020" end="00:37:59.799" style="s2">for craving</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.189" end="00:38:07.160" style="s2">right so at the right if you&#39;re at the</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.779" end="00:38:34.189" style="s2">start to move up away as a self trance</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.170" end="00:38:36.499" style="s2">and I start to regain agency but as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.189" end="00:38:39.079" style="s2">may expect you can&#39;t simply maximize</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.499" end="00:38:43.069" style="s2">this and this is Velma&#39;s point it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:07.479" style="s2">keep enhancing agency no because then</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.719" end="00:39:10.069" style="s2">you get into the problem that is typify</p>

<p begin="00:44:14.650" end="00:44:18.070" style="s2">talked a lot about this and this I</p>

<p begin="00:44:27.610" end="00:44:32.410" style="s2">already but this which I&#39;ve alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.220" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">many times we need to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.410" end="00:44:40.390" style="s2">because it points to something really</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.390" end="00:44:46.810" style="s2">article on this is by Thomas Nagel it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">called the absurd it also talks about in</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:57.220" style="s2">I want to try and show you is how much</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.230" end="00:45:00.010" style="s2">absurdity is a perspective of</p>

<p begin="00:45:07.350" end="00:45:12.700" style="s2">first of all Nagel does something very</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.700" end="00:45:16.420" style="s2">very important in the absurd he talks</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.700" end="00:45:19.710" style="s2">about how we behave as if the absurd is</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.420" end="00:45:23.350" style="s2">a result of our inferential processing</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.710" end="00:45:27.130" style="s2">and we purport to give arguments that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.350" end="00:45:28.840" style="s2">lead to the conclusion of absurdity so</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.130" end="00:45:34.030" style="s2">we give an argument like well what I do</p>
