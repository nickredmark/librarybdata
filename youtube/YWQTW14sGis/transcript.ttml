<p begin="00:02:02.360" end="00:02:07.130" style="s2">of what I would call a season of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.120" end="00:02:08.840" style="s2">topics that we&#39;ve been kind of swirling</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.130" end="00:02:10.310" style="s2">around everything is actually connected</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.840" end="00:02:12.319" style="s2">when you put all these chains together</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.310" end="00:02:13.970" style="s2">and these next three episodes are</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.319" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">definitely going to cohere and bring it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.970" end="00:02:17.300" style="s2">all together kind of like IKEA furniture</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:20.709" style="s2">when you get to like the last couple</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:23.300" style="s2">steps and it all locks into place so</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.709" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">last week we talked about blackmail</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.300" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">inflation which was the exploration of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.280" end="00:02:34.670" style="s2">what it means to take zero trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.610" end="00:02:36.230" style="s2">networks that rely on mutual blackmail</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.670" end="00:02:38.090" style="s2">and then destroy the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.230" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">blackmail material that keeps those</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.090" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">trust networks together and the way to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">destroy them is to use deep fakes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:45.830" style="s2">explode the volume of it and thus</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:47.480" style="s2">inflate it the same way you would</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.830" end="00:02:50.230" style="s2">inflate gold by printing too much</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.480" end="00:02:52.160" style="s2">certificates of deposit against it that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.230" end="00:02:54.410" style="s2">opened up what we would call the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.160" end="00:02:56.450" style="s2">Tartarus scenario where all of these</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.410" end="00:02:58.430" style="s2">mutually blackmail but powerful people</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.450" end="00:03:01.160" style="s2">are suddenly decoupled from one another</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.430" end="00:03:03.050" style="s2">that can spell certain disaster so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:04.610" style="s2">been doing doom porn for the past two</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.050" end="00:03:07.790" style="s2">episodes now it&#39;s time to look at some</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.610" end="00:03:09.650" style="s2">of the solutions that are possible and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.790" end="00:03:11.870" style="s2">at least trending towards these</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.650" end="00:03:15.050" style="s2">directions so the first one is I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.870" end="00:03:17.150" style="s2">to take some parlance from Jordan Green</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.050" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">Green Hall I&#39;m not sure if he came up</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.150" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">with game a game B but he&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.940" style="s2">heavy in that community so this</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:25.250" style="s2">particular episode is going to look into</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.940" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">what&#39;s called game days most likely</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.250" end="00:03:29.569" style="s2">outcome in the Tartar scenario and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:33.010" style="s2">we&#39;re and that&#39;s going to be called</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.569" end="00:03:37.480" style="s2">robotic nationalism so with that said</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.010" end="00:03:44.030" style="s2">let&#39;s get this funny show started I</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.480" end="00:03:47.030" style="s2">think and also I believe I fixed my</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.030" end="00:03:48.739" style="s2">audio so I should have a much better</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.030" end="00:03:49.760" style="s2">quality audio this time around I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.739" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">really excited about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.760" end="00:04:02.840" style="s2">okay sure I shared just the screen let</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:05.630" style="s2">me confirm mistake on my part and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.840" end="00:04:08.660" style="s2">apologize see that&#39;s right yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.630" end="00:04:12.380" style="s2">correct okay we&#39;re back okay robotic</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.380" end="00:04:16.250" style="s2">this but it really doesn&#39;t I&#39;m just you</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.750" end="00:04:19.130" style="s2">know just grabbing some stuff for</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.130" end="00:04:24.460" style="s2">wonderful little VPN that might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.859" end="00:04:27.890" style="s2">relevant later on than the slide so</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.460" end="00:04:29.479" style="s2">robotic nationalism is going to explore</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.890" end="00:04:31.850" style="s2">what we all know as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.479" end="00:04:36.260" style="s2">military-industrial complex which is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.850" end="00:04:37.909" style="s2">pile of scary words and that&#39;s big which</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.260" end="00:04:39.229" style="s2">is usually a pile of scary words and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.909" end="00:04:40.310" style="s2">everyone has their own personal opinion</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.229" end="00:04:42.139" style="s2">of what it is but we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.310" end="00:04:44.419" style="s2">look into personal opinions we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.139" end="00:04:47.599" style="s2">to look into the key functions of why it</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.419" end="00:04:49.669" style="s2">keeps happening the core behind all of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.599" end="00:04:50.900" style="s2">it the problems that&#39;s actually solving</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.669" end="00:04:55.039" style="s2">because it is solving a specific problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.900" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not all greed and how it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.039" end="00:05:00.409" style="s2">to extend in a world of cheap robotics</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:01.699" style="s2">and AI so to get started I always like</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.409" end="00:05:04.400" style="s2">to start with the fundamentals as you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.699" end="00:05:05.240" style="s2">know so we&#39;re gonna start with war well</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.400" end="00:05:07.490" style="s2">first we&#39;re gonna start with them to</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.110" end="00:06:42.879" style="s2">these were like farmers who had never</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.309" end="00:07:09.610" style="s2">very long time this was a devastating</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.800" end="00:07:12.099" style="s2">like super asymmetrical advantage over</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.939" end="00:07:37.959" style="s2">have all these problems the the proto is</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.769" end="00:07:40.779" style="s2">the proto Judd ayah Empire collapses</p>

<p begin="00:07:40.779" end="00:07:45.789" style="s2">back so far to this day it still hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.939" end="00:07:49.059" style="s2">recovered you have the proto Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.789" end="00:07:51.610" style="s2">empires collapsing and the proto Syrian</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.740" end="00:07:57.789" style="s2">more inland and they start setting up</p>

<p begin="00:08:04.930" end="00:08:10.449" style="s2">name I can&#39;t pronounce but the Persian</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.110" end="00:08:12.729" style="s2">Empire becomes a massive player as a</p>

<p begin="00:08:42.860" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">guess but these are the stabby squares</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.620" end="00:08:53.120" style="s2">of AB Alexander the Great and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:08:55.280" style="s2">when they intercepted arias and took his</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.120" end="00:08:57.560" style="s2">gold cart it was the equivalent of three</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.280" end="00:09:00.020" style="s2">billion dollars in gold in today&#39;s value</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.560" end="00:09:04.310" style="s2">so that gold injection which was the</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.310" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">and all these other players</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.670" end="00:09:11.450" style="s2">Alexander basically said yo I can just</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:13.790" style="s2">through that in a Europe without that</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.450" end="00:09:16.100" style="s2">move you would not have Europe as a</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.100" end="00:09:20.210" style="s2">changed all of it we would have been a</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.020" end="00:09:22.460" style="s2">like we as in white people who are white</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">people here at least we white people</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.460" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">would have been a backwater for all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.360" style="s2">time had Alexander not done this by</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:32.450" style="s2">basically stealing all of the gold from</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.360" end="00:09:34.790" style="s2">antiquity the rest of the world was</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.450" end="00:09:36.200" style="s2">forced to deal with Europe as a trade</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.790" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">partner at the very minimum instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.200" end="00:09:40.220" style="s2">just an endless source of slaves and you</p>

<p begin="00:09:40.220" end="00:09:47.050" style="s2">people so that&#39;s again war changing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.390" end="00:09:51.020" style="s2">world and whether we like it or not of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.050" end="00:09:52.520" style="s2">course that gold injection powers a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.020" end="00:09:54.440" style="s2">of the Grecian empires which then in</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.520" end="00:09:56.450" style="s2">turn leads to the robustness of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.440" end="00:09:58.610" style="s2">European economy which of course leads</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.450" end="00:10:01.310" style="s2">to Rome being able to form its unique</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.610" end="00:10:03.710" style="s2">Republic expanding outward and outward</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.310" end="00:10:05.570" style="s2">up until you get to I can never</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.710" end="00:10:07.310" style="s2">pronounce this guy&#39;s name but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.570" end="00:10:10.940" style="s2">important this is just a fun little</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.310" end="00:10:12.170" style="s2">example of Julius Caesar which I always</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.940" end="00:10:15.320" style="s2">thought was a really good statue of him</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.170" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">Julius Caesar demonstrating a brilliance</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.320" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">of logistics more so than direct muscle</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:22.070" style="s2">he&#39;s not out there stabbing people be</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:24.890" style="s2">like I&#39;m the biggest soldier he was able</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.070" end="00:10:27.950" style="s2">to command wartime engineering building</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.890" end="00:10:29.510" style="s2">bridges on the fly using immediate local</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.950" end="00:10:32.510" style="s2">resources and the expertise he dragged</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.510" end="00:10:34.580" style="s2">with him to cross streams of water and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.510" end="00:10:39.200" style="s2">move his entire supply chain across it</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.580" end="00:10:41.260" style="s2">in this particular fight obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.200" end="00:10:44.900" style="s2">battle alius I can&#39;t remember the name</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.260" end="00:10:46.490" style="s2">this particular fight he was severely at</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.900" end="00:10:48.920" style="s2">a disadvantage and he basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.490" end="00:10:49.250" style="s2">surrounded this guy&#39;s forces and his</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.920" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">city</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.250" end="00:10:54.860" style="s2">with two gigantic walls and starved them</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:56.840" style="s2">out and it worked so this is this is one</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.860" end="00:11:00.920" style="s2">of those examples where planning</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.840" end="00:11:02.480" style="s2">logistics foresight and insight changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.920" end="00:11:04.490" style="s2">the nature of war itself it became less</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.480" end="00:11:06.410" style="s2">about bravery and heroism and more about</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.490" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">really thinking when many many moves</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.410" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">down the line</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:13.880" style="s2">the brilliance of this play led of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">course to the the formation of Imperial</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.880" end="00:11:18.500" style="s2">Rome when he would then cross the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:20.210" style="s2">Rubicon and and basically and begin the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.500" end="00:11:21.770" style="s2">ending of the Republican and bring the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.210" end="00:11:24.500" style="s2">Imperial Rome into play which would then</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.770" end="00:11:26.420" style="s2">resolve into the bifurcation of Rome</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.500" end="00:11:28.820" style="s2">which is Western Europe Western Rome in</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.420" end="00:11:30.890" style="s2">eastern room where you have Rome proper</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.820" end="00:11:33.700" style="s2">as the capital and then Constantinople</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.890" end="00:11:35.630" style="s2">way off and the borderlands of Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.700" end="00:11:37.930" style="s2">which of course leads just did a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.630" end="00:11:40.760" style="s2">wonderful Crusades which is one of those</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.930" end="00:11:42.770" style="s2">misunderstood periods of war or history</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.760" end="00:11:44.740" style="s2">it&#39;s often seen as like oh this is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.770" end="00:11:48.440" style="s2">religious intolerance and bigotry and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.740" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">not really more than anything you had a</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.440" end="00:11:52.940" style="s2">surplus male population in Europe at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:55.250" style="s2">time I got a dump that hormone somewhere</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.250" end="00:11:58.970" style="s2">in your fields yet the Vikings were</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.140" end="00:12:01.460" style="s2">maybe 300 years before this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.970" end="00:12:03.589" style="s2">started you got to put him somewhere but</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.460" end="00:12:06.290" style="s2">more importantly they wanted to protect</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.589" end="00:12:08.960" style="s2">Constantinople the the Pope at the time</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.290" end="00:12:11.780" style="s2">he saw a chance to unify Rome after the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.960" end="00:12:14.360" style="s2">bifurcation and he said okay well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.780" end="00:12:16.010" style="s2">bring some Western European forces in to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.360" end="00:12:17.420" style="s2">the protection of Constantinople but</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.010" end="00:12:19.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not just gonna post soldiers at</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.420" end="00:12:22.280" style="s2">the gates we&#39;re gonna set a buffer</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.220" end="00:12:24.080" style="s2">States beyond Constantinople so all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.280" end="00:12:25.760" style="s2">way down to Jerusalem and and every</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.080" end="00:12:27.800" style="s2">country in between and that those buffer</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.760" end="00:12:30.110" style="s2">states are going to absorb and slow down</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.800" end="00:12:33.620" style="s2">attacks against Constantinople because</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.110" end="00:12:35.710" style="s2">at this time the the they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.620" end="00:12:38.390" style="s2">Ottomans per se but the proto Ottomans</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.710" end="00:12:39.830" style="s2">they were significant fighting for us</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.390" end="00:12:41.930" style="s2">it&#39;s very powerful they were able to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.830" end="00:12:43.790" style="s2">command the the wealth of the Silk Road</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.930" end="00:12:45.410" style="s2">to their advantage considerably they</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.790" end="00:12:47.780" style="s2">were not they were not just a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.410" end="00:12:50.260" style="s2">like back waters these were brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.780" end="00:12:55.280" style="s2">intelligent logistics people themselves</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.260" end="00:12:58.310" style="s2">and for hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.280" end="00:13:00.620" style="s2">I think the Crusades kicked off and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.310" end="00:13:03.110" style="s2">Constantinople was inevitably sacked by</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.620" end="00:13:05.990" style="s2">these forces by</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.110" end="00:13:08.970" style="s2">by like a dynasty who was just obsessed</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.990" end="00:13:10.500" style="s2">with sacking Constantinople like he had</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.970" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">visions of it like like divine</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.500" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">premonitions of sacking Constantinople</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.540" end="00:13:18.480" style="s2">oh it&#39;s Microsoft from a med he has</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">opinions he looks like he referred to my</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.480" end="00:13:23.010" style="s2">city as Constantinople this is the guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:25.890" style="s2">who eventually took it and the way he</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.010" end="00:13:29.160" style="s2">took it was with cannons big cannons</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.890" end="00:13:35.250" style="s2">like big cannons fifteen hundred&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.160" end="00:13:38.610" style="s2">bronze that would shoot a 100-pound rock</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.250" end="00:13:40.170" style="s2">one mile that type of cannery I mean</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.610" end="00:13:42.450" style="s2">these things are like the cannoneers</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.170" end="00:13:43.680" style="s2">were death after the first round so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.450" end="00:13:48.060" style="s2">just had a bunch of deaf people just</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.680" end="00:13:49.260" style="s2">shooting this stuff and it to really</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.060" end="00:13:51.300" style="s2">just drive home but had this guy</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.260" end="00:13:53.550" style="s2">seriousness and taking Constantinople</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:57.750" style="s2">not only was he just hammering the walls</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.550" end="00:13:59.490" style="s2">which were like legendary walls he with</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.750" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">these cannons there was also like this</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.490" end="00:14:04.560" style="s2">like 700 meter chain in the harbor and</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:06.210" style="s2">boats could not pass through it so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.560" end="00:14:08.580" style="s2">couldn&#39;t send a naval force to actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.210" end="00:14:10.770" style="s2">attack Constantinople so what this guy</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.580" end="00:14:13.260" style="s2">did is he took his entire Navy and he</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.770" end="00:14:14.940" style="s2">just put it on log rollers and moved it</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.260" end="00:14:17.310" style="s2">around the land to the opposite side of</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.940" end="00:14:19.470" style="s2">the chain that&#39;s that&#39;s like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.310" end="00:14:21.780" style="s2">dedication right this guy did it he took</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.470" end="00:14:25.320" style="s2">continent Constantinople turned in</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.780" end="00:14:27.210" style="s2">Istanbul and by controlling that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.320" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">basically controlled all of the Silk</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.210" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">Road demand of Europe into Europe so it</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:34.110" style="s2">was like this hotbed node like this</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:36.300" style="s2">really powerful trade hub and so he</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.110" end="00:14:38.520" style="s2">owned European demand so you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.300" end="00:14:42.360" style="s2">get silk pepper nothing you couldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.520" end="00:14:44.310" style="s2">anything unless you paid this guy this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.360" end="00:14:46.440" style="s2">of course leads to the age of sale where</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.310" end="00:14:48.510" style="s2">the Europeans say that not paying</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.440" end="00:14:51.390" style="s2">that guy it&#39;s actually better for me to</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.510" end="00:14:53.070" style="s2">sail around Africa than pay that guy and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.390" end="00:14:55.350" style="s2">so you had this huge incentive to start</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.070" end="00:14:58.290" style="s2">exploring these ships that can do all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.350" end="00:15:01.500" style="s2">this trade and this was again the</p>

<p begin="00:15:01.500" end="00:15:04.410" style="s2">through that little piece of land</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.790" end="00:15:05.610" style="s2">well the European said we&#39;ll ship our</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.410" end="00:15:07.440" style="s2">ships all across the planet instead</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.610" end="00:15:09.390" style="s2">thank you very much we&#39;ll set up a</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.440" end="00:15:11.960" style="s2">secondary plan for all of our spice</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.390" end="00:15:11.960" style="s2">trade instead</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.250" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">this kind of pivots outside of the very</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.070" end="00:15:20.490" style="s2">interesting intricacies of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:25.470" style="s2">cat-and-mouse access to the Silk Road</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:29.430" style="s2">stuff the advent of the musket is kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.470" end="00:15:31.440" style="s2">of self it&#39;s obvious I think in the 13</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.430" end="00:15:35.010" style="s2">hundreds the pope band of the crossbow</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.440" end="00:15:37.170" style="s2">because it was able to allow peasants to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.010" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">completely dismantle his heavy Calvary</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.170" end="00:15:40.920" style="s2">and heavy Calvary is super expensive you</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:42.990" style="s2">had the arm of the person trained the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.920" end="00:15:44.070" style="s2">person he had the arm of a horse I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.990" end="00:15:46.130" style="s2">know if you ever armored a horse before</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.070" end="00:15:48.810" style="s2">but that&#39;s pretty expensive stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.130" end="00:15:50.490" style="s2">one crossbow just just go right through</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.810" end="00:15:53.130" style="s2">your armor and that was it so I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.490" end="00:15:55.170" style="s2">was like the ak-47 of its time and Pope</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.130" end="00:15:56.700" style="s2">banned it forever but they tried to ban</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.170" end="00:15:58.380" style="s2">muskets and go so well</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.700" end="00:16:00.150" style="s2">these were getting easier produced</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.380" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">mostly because of the sacking of</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.150" end="00:16:06.210" style="s2">Constantinople Turkish mastery of</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:07.650" style="s2">gunpowder and cannon Rhee was starting</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.210" end="00:16:09.360" style="s2">to be embraced by the rest of Europe</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.650" end="00:16:10.650" style="s2">afterwards they got their asses handed</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.360" end="00:16:13.710" style="s2">to him and they started to adapt pretty</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.650" end="00:16:16.200" style="s2">quick so the musketry not really exactly</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.710" end="00:16:17.400" style="s2">accurate just a ball in a smoothbore so</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.200" end="00:16:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just like you know the ball is</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.400" end="00:16:21.000" style="s2">going down the bore and then maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.720" end="00:16:23.339" style="s2">goes it&#39;s like it&#39;s like Schrodinger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.000" end="00:16:26.580" style="s2">musket where does it go so that the the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.339" end="00:16:29.190" style="s2">to counter that you just line up like</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.580" end="00:16:31.110" style="s2">1020 people and you hope for the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.190" end="00:16:33.240" style="s2">you know you have a you have 20 chances</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.110" end="00:16:35.460" style="s2">to probably hit your targets which is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.240" end="00:16:36.540" style="s2">why we look at square formations and</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.460" end="00:16:39.780" style="s2">think that&#39;s insane</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.540" end="00:16:41.250" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s how yeah that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.780" end="00:16:43.380" style="s2">you accounted for the inaccuracy of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.250" end="00:16:45.180" style="s2">these initial weapons these students are</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.380" end="00:16:47.070" style="s2">just tearing through armor so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.180" end="00:16:50.070" style="s2">probably in around the mid 1500s at this</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.070" end="00:16:52.589" style="s2">point just chewing through armor and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.070" end="00:16:54.620" style="s2">again really expensive investment it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.589" end="00:16:57.720" style="s2">sign of culture it&#39;s a sign of royalty</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.620" end="00:17:00.839" style="s2">heredity and these things were just you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.720" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">know angry proto Republicans and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.839" end="00:17:03.480" style="s2">mean that in the American sense I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:05.449" style="s2">that in the European sense the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.480" end="00:17:09.209" style="s2">Republican revolutions of the 1600s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.449" end="00:17:11.730" style="s2">these guys were just happy to overthrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.209" end="00:17:15.959" style="s2">a royalty left right and center using</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.730" end="00:17:19.110" style="s2">their newfound toy and speaking of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.959" end="00:17:20.910" style="s2">newfound toys you start using guns long</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.110" end="00:17:23.250" style="s2">enough to get more accurate with it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.910" end="00:17:26.550" style="s2">you get more destructive with it so</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.250" end="00:17:27.750" style="s2">these are these rounds these artillery</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.550" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">stuff man</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.750" end="00:17:35.850" style="s2">think this was able of targeting I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:38.160" style="s2">5,000 meters off with a five foot range</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.850" end="00:17:40.410" style="s2">of error in the hands of a skilled</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.160" end="00:17:43.850" style="s2">cannoneer these things were devastating</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.410" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">these are the 12 pound the 12 pound</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.850" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">Armstrong guns these were they you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:54.660" style="s2">the ability of Europe to marshal greater</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">and greater forces actually let me check</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.660" end="00:17:58.950" style="s2">my notes so I should mention there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:04.290" style="s2">one other factor that makes this so</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">devastating right so the guy named</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.290" end="00:18:08.550" style="s2">Napoleon he was a cannoneer when he</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:11.190" style="s2">first got started he was actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.550" end="00:18:13.470" style="s2">the mathematics and calculating the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.190" end="00:18:15.000" style="s2">logistics to run cannons you&#39;ll see he</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.470" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">actually contributes a small amount to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.000" end="00:18:19.620" style="s2">mathematics surprisingly because of his</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:21.990" style="s2">experience as a cannoneer and he came</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.620" end="00:18:24.420" style="s2">from a warrior culture the warrior</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.990" end="00:18:25.800" style="s2">culture of France was feared I mean now</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.420" end="00:18:28.770" style="s2">we just call him cheese-eating surrender</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.800" end="00:18:31.800" style="s2">monkeys but like like France back then</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.770" end="00:18:36.450" style="s2">was whoa their their military was was</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.800" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">world like top notch and that happened</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.450" end="00:18:42.240" style="s2">because of the French Revolution and</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:44.310" style="s2">1700 they executed their King and all</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.240" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">the royalty in Europe said I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.310" end="00:18:48.780" style="s2">nothing to do with this we need to stop</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:50.850" style="s2">these anti-monarchists from killing us</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.780" end="00:18:53.040" style="s2">and so the entirety of Europe basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.850" end="00:18:55.650" style="s2">all the royalty who were mostly at each</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.040" end="00:18:58.500" style="s2">other&#39;s throats summoned a grand army to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.650" end="00:19:00.630" style="s2">then just go stop out this this this</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.500" end="00:19:04.500" style="s2">revolutionary France problem that they</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.630" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">had but the French their response was</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.500" end="00:19:07.860" style="s2">called level Mouse which I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:09.150" style="s2">I&#39;m pronouncing because I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.860" end="00:19:12.420" style="s2">pronounce French for the life of me</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.150" end="00:19:15.420" style="s2">which means to conscription go French</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.420" end="00:19:17.430" style="s2">male as a soldier every single one that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.420" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">means if you&#39;re a city you&#39;re a deli</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.430" end="00:19:21.720" style="s2">person you&#39;re a farmer you&#39;ve never held</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:23.940" style="s2">a gun before it does not matter you are</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.720" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">now a soldier they were so successful in</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.940" end="00:19:27.420" style="s2">repelling the monarchists that they were</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:29.220" style="s2">able to extend beyond their borders and</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.420" end="00:19:31.260" style="s2">set up revolutionary enclaves all</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.220" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">throughout Rome all throughout Europe as</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.260" end="00:19:34.980" style="s2">well monarchists were not happy about</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:37.620" style="s2">this development it&#39;s severely backfired</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.980" end="00:19:39.630" style="s2">but then again they didn&#39;t even envision</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.620" end="00:19:41.270" style="s2">that it was possible to take every</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.630" end="00:19:43.370" style="s2">single male in your country and</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.270" end="00:19:45.740" style="s2">turn them into a soldier this was not</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.370" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">possible in most of history because if</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.740" end="00:19:49.340" style="s2">you turned your farmers in the soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">who the hell was going to feed you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.340" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">were dead in a couple months so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:54.620" style="s2">needed that dedicated farmer base but</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.480" style="s2">the French because they gutted their</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.620" end="00:19:58.850" style="s2">aristocracy they were already screwed</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.480" end="00:20:00.260" style="s2">they had to redo their entire order</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.850" end="00:20:01.880" style="s2">anyway so they said screw it let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.260" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">make everybody a soldier and whoever</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.880" end="00:20:06.140" style="s2">survives great that&#39;s less criminals</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:08.990" style="s2">later on it&#39;s a really cold calculation</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.140" end="00:20:10.940" style="s2">but it was devastating it resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.990" end="00:20:13.550" style="s2">these type of cannoneer developments as</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.940" end="00:20:16.010" style="s2">a result surprisingly so now the French</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.550" end="00:20:17.590" style="s2">who were bringing all of their soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.010" end="00:20:19.730" style="s2">into the field now every other</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.590" end="00:20:21.500" style="s2">monarchist had to do the same and every</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.730" end="00:20:23.240" style="s2">other Republic had to do the same so now</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.500" end="00:20:25.070" style="s2">they&#39;re feeling these huge amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.240" end="00:20:26.690" style="s2">people just to stay competitive and here</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.070" end="00:20:28.490" style="s2">comes the artillery which is just</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.690" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">chewing through people and you really</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.490" end="00:20:34.460" style="s2">start to see this come World War one</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:36.560" style="s2">where artillery is just I mean crushing</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.460" end="00:20:39.440" style="s2">people absolutely eliminating entire</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.560" end="00:20:43.040" style="s2">squads of people and they get better and</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.440" end="00:20:44.540" style="s2">better with it with it over time so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.040" end="00:20:46.250" style="s2">starts dealing with these industrial</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:47.930" style="s2">armies as they&#39;re able to raise greater</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.250" end="00:20:49.430" style="s2">and greater populations and give them</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.930" end="00:20:50.690" style="s2">greater and greater technologies and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.430" end="00:20:53.930" style="s2">very spiffy little helmets that look</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.690" end="00:20:55.670" style="s2">like trees we start to see that hey we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.930" end="00:20:57.260" style="s2">need to counter not only can we raise</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.670" end="00:20:59.810" style="s2">these armies but we need to counter them</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.260" end="00:21:01.910" style="s2">too and artillery is a pretty good bet</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.810" end="00:21:03.590" style="s2">right now yeah there&#39;s airplanes and all</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.910" end="00:21:05.630" style="s2">that stuff but artillery is really there</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.590" end="00:21:07.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the creme de la creme of just</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.630" end="00:21:09.500" style="s2">grinding out meat so we need to make</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.880" end="00:21:11.720" style="s2">sure that these artillery gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.500" end="00:21:14.030" style="s2">bit better this was the birth of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.720" end="00:21:16.580" style="s2">computer you know the computer you and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.030" end="00:21:19.070" style="s2">are using right now in yak-yak was</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.580" end="00:21:20.990" style="s2">designed to calculate artillery round</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.070" end="00:21:23.540" style="s2">Precision&#39;s not just for individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.990" end="00:21:26.260" style="s2">shots but also for rolling artillery</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.540" end="00:21:28.760" style="s2">when you Moulton you fire multiple</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.260" end="00:21:30.830" style="s2">artillery pieces over a great distance</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.760" end="00:21:31.970" style="s2">at specific time intervals under</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.830" end="00:21:33.920" style="s2">different winds under different</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.970" end="00:21:36.350" style="s2">pressures those under different grains</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.920" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">and they would land in coordination to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.350" end="00:21:40.840" style="s2">maximize the devastation for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:43.400" style="s2">was requested according to the spotters</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.840" end="00:21:45.050" style="s2">and you could have a team of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.400" end="00:21:49.790" style="s2">mathematicians in the field doing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.050" end="00:21:51.470" style="s2">but what one was brutal you could not</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.790" end="00:21:53.900" style="s2">put brainpower on the frontline they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.470" end="00:21:55.160" style="s2">they die of trench foot or they&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.900" end="00:21:56.990" style="s2">trench foot they would get in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.160" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">did they would get rat bites I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.990" end="00:22:01.310" style="s2">serious problems you couldn&#39;t keep that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.700" end="00:22:02.300" style="s2">brainpower on the front line so you kept</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.310" end="00:22:05.540" style="s2">them in the back but then you had to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.300" end="00:22:09.010" style="s2">radio back and forth and mess so all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.540" end="00:22:12.020" style="s2">this logistics overhead starts to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.010" end="00:22:13.280" style="s2">explore the Rd of computational services</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.020" end="00:22:15.590" style="s2">like there are computational engines</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.280" end="00:22:18.290" style="s2">like the ENIAC and the the hilarious</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.590" end="00:22:20.660" style="s2">irony is that when any AK fire comes</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.290" end="00:22:21.920" style="s2">online it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t calculate a</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.660" end="00:22:23.630" style="s2">single thing about artillery when it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.920" end="00:22:27.020" style="s2">comes online the first thing it&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.630" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">it calculators is nuclear weaponry which</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.020" end="00:22:33.590" style="s2">is what then leads us to our unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:35.480" style="s2">outcome where well now we got nukes so</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.590" end="00:22:37.670" style="s2">let&#39;s take artillery and instead of</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.480" end="00:22:39.530" style="s2">every shell blowing up like a 20 foot</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.670" end="00:22:41.780" style="s2">radius let&#39;s say every shell blows up a</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.530" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">two mile radius now we got some serious</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.780" end="00:22:45.740" style="s2">problems and then throw some planes in</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:47.030" style="s2">it I can deliver it really quickly then</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.740" end="00:22:48.350" style="s2">tip them on a missile and now they can</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.030" end="00:22:49.940" style="s2">really drop all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.350" end="00:22:52.100" style="s2">then put them in a submarine and who</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.940" end="00:22:57.260" style="s2">knows when they can attack you so this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.100" end="00:22:59.480" style="s2">new problem is hard so how do you make</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.260" end="00:23:01.400" style="s2">sure that you don&#39;t get nuked well you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.480" end="00:23:02.960" style="s2">you over nuke yourself you you over</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.400" end="00:23:05.180" style="s2">produce your nukes so if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.960" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">nuke me why I&#39;m gonna nuke you okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.180" end="00:23:08.750" style="s2">mutually assured destruction all right a</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:10.010" style="s2">little bit of game theory fine but what</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.750" end="00:23:11.780" style="s2">if I knock out your first strike</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.010" end="00:23:14.300" style="s2">capability or your retaliatory</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.780" end="00:23:16.010" style="s2">capability let&#39;s say hit your telecoms I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.300" end="00:23:17.930" style="s2">start taking your satellites out I start</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.010" end="00:23:20.930" style="s2">hitting your your fiber optics your your</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.930" end="00:23:23.720" style="s2">ocean fiber alright that&#39;s a problem but</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.930" end="00:23:25.490" style="s2">what if my networks self-heal what if my</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.720" end="00:23:27.320" style="s2">telecoms can still route to each other</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.490" end="00:23:29.510" style="s2">even if you take out a core hub</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.320" end="00:23:31.070" style="s2">well congratulations we just invented</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.510" end="00:23:33.770" style="s2">packet switching which is the core of</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.070" end="00:23:35.270" style="s2">the Internet the internet works because</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.770" end="00:23:37.220" style="s2">of packet switching tcp/ip packet</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.270" end="00:23:39.260" style="s2">switching and this was developed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.220" end="00:23:40.790" style="s2">ensure first-strike capability in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.260" end="00:23:43.910" style="s2">nuclear bombardment scenario so that</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.790" end="00:23:46.780" style="s2">game theory of mad could be sustained so</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.910" end="00:23:49.460" style="s2">the internet exists because of artillery</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.780" end="00:23:52.120" style="s2">that&#39;s a weird thing to say but there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.460" end="00:23:56.630" style="s2">a direct line of reasoning that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.120" end="00:23:58.550" style="s2">supports that argument and then of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.630" end="00:24:00.140" style="s2">course we get them now now we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.550" end="00:24:02.150" style="s2">internet now we have memes fighting each</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.140" end="00:24:03.470" style="s2">other and it&#39;s just so French fur entral</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.150" end="00:24:05.030" style="s2">to be funny we&#39;re all quite familiar</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.470" end="00:24:07.910" style="s2">with me more I probably don&#39;t spend too</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.030" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">much time on it basically means of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.910" end="00:24:10.970" style="s2">classic</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.510" end="00:24:12.770" style="s2">of cyber semiotics you know if you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.970" end="00:24:15.170" style="s2">a narrative and it&#39;s really tightly</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.770" end="00:24:18.110" style="s2">manicured we can kick that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.170" end="00:24:21.290" style="s2">sideways no problem so these these</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.110" end="00:24:23.420" style="s2">things are these things are evil so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.290" end="00:24:28.400" style="s2">that&#39;s basically the history of war from</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.420" end="00:24:30.290" style="s2">chariots to find little Zoomer memes so</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.400" end="00:24:33.110" style="s2">let&#39;s look at the let&#39;s start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.290" end="00:24:37.430" style="s2">the numbers and participation of modern</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.110" end="00:24:40.130" style="s2">warfare in the in the current space this</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.430" end="00:24:43.040" style="s2">is a that&#39;s from World Bank yeah from</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.130" end="00:24:45.740" style="s2">World Bank we&#39;re starting to see this</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.040" end="00:24:48.500" style="s2">human participation in militaries across</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.740" end="00:24:50.650" style="s2">the world decline in relation to their</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.500" end="00:24:53.450" style="s2">population size we&#39;re not talking like</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.650" end="00:24:55.190" style="s2">severe declines and the absolute number</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.450" end="00:24:58.370" style="s2">of soldiers that exist that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.190" end="00:25:00.290" style="s2">pretty damn high but in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.370" end="00:25:02.420" style="s2">total share of the population it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.290" end="00:25:05.110" style="s2">lower it&#39;s decreasing considerably</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.420" end="00:25:07.640" style="s2">although there was a spike in Africa</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.110" end="00:25:11.060" style="s2">if you ever curious to look in that one</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.640" end="00:25:12.860" style="s2">you want to look at I think Liberia yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.060" end="00:25:15.050" style="s2">that spike probably comes from Liberia</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.860" end="00:25:19.490" style="s2">and Zimbabwe and all the Hotel Rwanda</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.050" end="00:25:21.350" style="s2">type stuff but you know Cold War is on</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.490" end="00:25:23.180" style="s2">its way out man we don&#39;t have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.350" end="00:25:25.070" style="s2">stuff now we can play finance games now</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:26.750" style="s2">we can blackmail each other woohoo you</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.070" end="00:25:29.690" style="s2">know it&#39;s no you don&#39;t need soldiers all</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.750" end="00:25:31.640" style="s2">over the place so it&#39;s look at these</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.690" end="00:25:34.160" style="s2">numbers here&#39;s a superpowers throughout</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.640" end="00:25:37.340" style="s2">time each one of the you know thousands</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.160" end="00:25:40.400" style="s2">of soldiers so this is 450,000 and</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.340" end="00:25:43.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a million 1.2 you&#39;ll see this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.400" end="00:25:44.570" style="s2">broken into West versus East you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.130" end="00:25:47.720" style="s2">at the very beginning the East has a</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.570" end="00:25:50.120" style="s2">significant advantage so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.720" end="00:25:53.450" style="s2">strong indicator of organization of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.120" end="00:25:56.540" style="s2">logistical talent of having a stable</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.450" end="00:25:57.860" style="s2">government and a heavy focus on stable</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.540" end="00:25:59.780" style="s2">government cuz fielding these types of</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.860" end="00:26:01.550" style="s2">numbers that&#39;s not easy and you know I</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.780" end="00:26:04.280" style="s2">admittedly when you&#39;re dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.550" end="00:26:08.270" style="s2">East they didn&#39;t have the the military</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.280" end="00:26:10.970" style="s2">brilliance that you see coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.270" end="00:26:13.100" style="s2">Middle East and Europe and early parts</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.970" end="00:26:16.100" style="s2">of North Africa they are able to feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.100" end="00:26:19.340" style="s2">very large numbers but not with a degree</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.100" end="00:26:22.010" style="s2">of great skill in terms of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.340" end="00:26:23.540" style="s2">sending signal</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.010" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">here and then delaying your attack and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.540" end="00:26:27.680" style="s2">then moving it here and there operating</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:29.240" style="s2">at a much larger pace in the East</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.680" end="00:26:31.070" style="s2">they&#39;re not dealing down with like these</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.240" end="00:26:32.420" style="s2">individual tactics although most the</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.070" end="00:26:33.980" style="s2">fighting does boil down there because</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.420" end="00:26:36.260" style="s2">once the fight starts it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.980" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">individual tactics and and swordplay and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.260" end="00:26:39.020" style="s2">that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:40.850" style="s2">the East is actually aligning their</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.020" end="00:26:44.870" style="s2">armies and their strategy is much more</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.850" end="00:26:46.460" style="s2">towards dynastic assumptions so they</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.870" end="00:26:48.740" style="s2">would raise these large armies and just</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.460" end="00:26:50.900" style="s2">having the larger army was enough to not</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.740" end="00:26:52.310" style="s2">have to deploy it so they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.900" end="00:26:55.310" style="s2">these things is like more and more</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.310" end="00:26:58.160" style="s2">bodyguards so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.310" end="00:27:00.110" style="s2">how the East looks at military versus</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.160" end="00:27:01.340" style="s2">how the West does it and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.110" end="00:27:04.220" style="s2">West in the early part I mean you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.340" end="00:27:06.590" style="s2">the Romans they have a good run here but</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.220" end="00:27:08.540" style="s2">but again I mean the most of this is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.590" end="00:27:11.060" style="s2">Middle East and and their early</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.540" end="00:27:12.530" style="s2">advantage with Mesopotamia France comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.060" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">along and does something cute at 13</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.530" end="00:27:16.040" style="s2">hundreds but you know for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:17.630" style="s2">this Middle East they get bit at least</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.040" end="00:27:21.650" style="s2">gets a really good run for this whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.630" end="00:27:24.110" style="s2">span of time and again just highlighting</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.650" end="00:27:26.840" style="s2">that type of stuff so now we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.110" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">at things changing and they change for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.840" end="00:27:29.420" style="s2">the reasons that we&#39;ve already gone over</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:31.250" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the French and the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.420" end="00:27:33.230" style="s2">a lot of the Germans and the Russians</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.250" end="00:27:34.550" style="s2">and the United States eventually goods</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.230" end="00:27:35.960" style="s2">mostly because of Civil War of course</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.550" end="00:27:37.490" style="s2">leave it to the United States to raise</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.960" end="00:27:39.350" style="s2">the most amount of soldiers against its</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.490" end="00:27:42.860" style="s2">own people but that&#39;s a different story</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.350" end="00:27:46.430" style="s2">you see the French does the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.860" end="00:27:47.390" style="s2">but their revolution the Russians but</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.430" end="00:27:48.710" style="s2">they&#39;re in the middle of war with</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.390" end="00:27:50.360" style="s2">Germany and World War one at this time</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.710" end="00:27:52.280" style="s2">so not really the case but the Germans</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.360" end="00:27:54.730" style="s2">and the Russians yeah yeah those guys</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.280" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">were just brutal they were just</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.730" end="00:28:00.620" style="s2">massacring each other nuts and you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:02.750" style="s2">it decline even though the absolute</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.620" end="00:28:05.230" style="s2">numbers are pretty high you see this</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.750" end="00:28:07.610" style="s2">like petering off in the east they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.230" end="00:28:09.680" style="s2">slowly being isolated because of</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.610" end="00:28:11.780" style="s2">colonialism they&#39;re slowly losing their</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.680" end="00:28:15.230" style="s2">their advantages here and their</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.780" end="00:28:17.960" style="s2">conquering the land masses of your--of</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.230" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">of Eurasia is no longer a good enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.960" end="00:28:22.700" style="s2">strategy the West is just surpassed in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.080" end="00:28:23.990" style="s2">terms of naval force and because a</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.700" end="00:28:26.450" style="s2">neighbor for us they have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.990" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">entire world the East did not have this</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.450" end="00:28:30.680" style="s2">and you see it in their military numbers</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:32.750" style="s2">it&#39;s just not holding hard admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.680" end="00:28:35.380" style="s2">the Japanese had a pretty good run</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.750" end="00:28:38.350" style="s2">against the Russians but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.380" end="00:28:41.620" style="s2">- blip that&#39;s a when you look at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.350" end="00:28:45.820" style="s2">overall trend you see the East is losing</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.620" end="00:28:48.640" style="s2">the East is long-term losing here I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.820" end="00:28:51.010" style="s2">the numbers are just net so now this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.640" end="00:28:52.960" style="s2">a breakdown of World War two which is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.010" end="00:28:57.130" style="s2">high I mean look at these numbers nine</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.960" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">million soldiers nine million are you</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.130" end="00:29:01.150" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:04.570" style="s2">12 million we sustained we put 12</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.150" end="00:29:06.100" style="s2">million soldier holy jesus the German</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.570" end="00:29:09.040" style="s2">Reich had 12 million I mean these are</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.100" end="00:29:12.340" style="s2">huge huge numbers so this is what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.040" end="00:29:14.470" style="s2">would call peak industrial warfare where</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.340" end="00:29:17.460" style="s2">you&#39;re able to deploy you&#39;re able to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.470" end="00:29:20.110" style="s2">total warfare you&#39;re able to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.460" end="00:29:22.630" style="s2">railroads and artillery and carrier</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.110" end="00:29:24.160" style="s2">pigeons and every single creative</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.630" end="00:29:26.380" style="s2">instinct of the human talent is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.160" end="00:29:28.150" style="s2">dumped into slaughtering each other in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.380" end="00:29:29.920" style="s2">this in this like ten year period and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.150" end="00:29:33.190" style="s2">you see it in these numbers are just</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.920" end="00:29:36.100" style="s2">extreme the numbers don&#39;t get this high</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.190" end="00:29:38.470" style="s2">again this is like this is like never</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.100" end="00:29:40.830" style="s2">again type numbers and a lot of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.470" end="00:29:42.850" style="s2">foreign policy is has been you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.830" end="00:29:45.970" style="s2">designed to prevent this type of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.850" end="00:29:47.170" style="s2">craziness so let me get to the West and</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.970" end="00:29:48.820" style="s2">this is where things start to get even</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.170" end="00:29:51.400" style="s2">is where things got interesting for a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.820" end="00:29:55.000" style="s2">long time in history though the East is</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.400" end="00:29:58.150" style="s2">able to field numbers that the West can</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.000" end="00:30:00.970" style="s2">field in terms of absolute interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.150" end="00:30:02.350" style="s2">the this is a I mean you look 50s and on</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.970" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s modernization that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.350" end="00:30:07.240" style="s2">globalization so now the East is able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:10.780" style="s2">channel they&#39;re able to not only have</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.240" end="00:30:12.970" style="s2">access to the the trade route that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.780" end="00:30:15.400" style="s2">Europeans had formed in the colonial and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.970" end="00:30:17.740" style="s2">sale period they&#39;re able to compete</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.400" end="00:30:19.450" style="s2">commercially they&#39;re able to consolidate</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.740" end="00:30:21.370" style="s2">their means of production they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.450" end="00:30:23.380" style="s2">to have access to capital in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.370" end="00:30:25.390" style="s2">were previously not accessible and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.380" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">see it in their military growth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.390" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">there right so now we have almost an</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:32.560" style="s2">even fight yeah how does that resolve I</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:35.140" style="s2">mean we&#39;re starting to see it right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.560" end="00:30:37.510" style="s2">these numbers stop at 2014 but Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.140" end="00:30:40.390" style="s2">very anti China and with these numbers</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.510" end="00:30:41.590" style="s2">most what happens right let&#39;s see what</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.390" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">happens when we start changing a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.590" end="00:30:47.200" style="s2">bit the technological premises mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:49.250" style="s2">that&#39;s some crazy numbers right there so</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.320" style="s2">as we as we&#39;ve noticed before</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.250" end="00:30:54.380" style="s2">we know that the hard participation of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.320" end="00:30:56.180" style="s2">people versus population of military is</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.380" end="00:30:58.370" style="s2">going down and correspondingly the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.180" end="00:31:01.490" style="s2">military expenditure as a percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.370" end="00:31:02.870" style="s2">GDP is also going down now that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.490" end="00:31:05.510" style="s2">crazy you might think they&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.870" end="00:31:08.360" style="s2">more and more now than ever before yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.510" end="00:31:10.130" style="s2">but as a percentage of GDP it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.360" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">technically true we&#39;re actually spending</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.130" end="00:31:13.940" style="s2">less and that&#39;s mostly because of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:15.500" style="s2">personnel costs withdrawing coming down</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.940" end="00:31:18.650" style="s2">we need less people to kill more people</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.500" end="00:31:19.940" style="s2">so there you go there&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.650" end="00:31:21.740" style="s2">trick that&#39;s going on here which I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.940" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">get into later it&#39;s called hiding the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.740" end="00:31:25.280" style="s2">numbers how do you categorize military</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.140" style="s2">expenditure well there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.280" end="00:31:30.830" style="s2">actually categorize military expenditure</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.140" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">that isn&#39;t military expenditure and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.830" end="00:31:34.760" style="s2">again the other factor you need to look</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:38.420" style="s2">into did the military spending go down</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.760" end="00:31:40.280" style="s2">or did the GDP go up that matters</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.420" end="00:31:42.830" style="s2">because you get this result in either</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.280" end="00:31:44.720" style="s2">way I don&#39;t need to cut spending to drop</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.830" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">the percentage I just need to raise GDP</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.720" end="00:31:48.650" style="s2">and maybe my spending is the same the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:51.500" style="s2">whole time comparatively speaking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.650" end="00:31:53.180" style="s2">just my GDP jumped up five times but my</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.500" end="00:31:55.040" style="s2">military expenditure verse it probably</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.180" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">haft so that&#39;s a weird ratio right</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.040" end="00:31:57.440" style="s2">whereas where&#39;s the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.290" style="s2">remaining that where are those numbers</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.440" end="00:32:01.520" style="s2">hidden right are they hidden at all so</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.290" end="00:32:03.110" style="s2">just keep these two things in mind</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.520" end="00:32:05.930" style="s2">someone tries to tell you that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.110" end="00:32:07.780" style="s2">becoming a more peaceful world I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.930" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">Steven Pinker has that argument a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.780" end="00:32:14.630" style="s2">these numbers are obviously clever ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:16.340" style="s2">to hide the accounting so how do you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.630" end="00:32:17.950" style="s2">hide those numbers because I alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.340" end="00:32:22.400" style="s2">it earlier it&#39;s a thing called dual use</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.950" end="00:32:25.880" style="s2">so dual use is a way to say we want this</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.400" end="00:32:29.180" style="s2">weapon but instead of paying the R&amp;D for</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.880" end="00:32:31.070" style="s2">it we&#39;re going to allow civilians to put</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.180" end="00:32:33.500" style="s2">their own capital into the development</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.070" end="00:32:35.630" style="s2">of the R&amp;D it&#39;s that way it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.500" end="00:32:37.040" style="s2">military expenditure it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.630" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">economy look at that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.040" end="00:32:41.210" style="s2">so say chemical manufacturing for</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:41.930" style="s2">example take Dow and and DuPont and all</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.210" end="00:32:43.820" style="s2">those type of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.930" end="00:32:45.230" style="s2">you know that&#39;s they can put their</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.820" end="00:32:46.670" style="s2">private capital into it and it can</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.230" end="00:32:48.410" style="s2">develop all these huge things and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.670" end="00:32:50.900" style="s2">does develop stuff like you know radium</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.410" end="00:32:53.540" style="s2">wristwatches that give you cancer or all</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.900" end="00:32:54.560" style="s2">types of other chemicals you need well</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.540" end="00:32:56.060" style="s2">it turns out you get a chemical</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.560" end="00:32:57.500" style="s2">artillery out of that too well look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.060" end="00:33:00.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s kind of strange it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.500" end="00:33:01.940" style="s2">it&#39;s dual use I&#39;m getting the civilian</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.380" end="00:33:02.600" style="s2">aspect of it and I&#39;m able to hide the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.940" end="00:33:05.650" style="s2">numbers off</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.600" end="00:33:09.160" style="s2">to expenditure books and entreat it as</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.650" end="00:33:11.929" style="s2">capital mature I&#39;m sorry tit as um</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.160" end="00:33:13.820" style="s2">civilian ech treated as the economy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.929" end="00:33:16.280" style="s2">then I take like a little bit off the</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.820" end="00:33:19.160" style="s2">top and I get my chemical artillery neat</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.280" end="00:33:20.630" style="s2">that&#39;s a neat trick can I do it again of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.160" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">course you could do it again nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.630" end="00:33:23.270" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:24.770" style="s2">well let&#39;s generate no we have two</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.270" end="00:33:27.410" style="s2">hundred some-odd nuclear power plants in</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.770" end="00:33:29.510" style="s2">America and turns out you can make a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.410" end="00:33:31.280" style="s2">of weapons with that so all the funding</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.510" end="00:33:34.120" style="s2">here is civilian a mix of private ins</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.280" end="00:33:36.470" style="s2">mix of private and public yes admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.120" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">but that&#39;s all to offset the production</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.470" end="00:33:41.000" style="s2">of these type of things so again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:42.860" style="s2">hiding the numbers and dual-use reinter</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.000" end="00:33:44.000" style="s2">evey achill super spacex stuff we gotta</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.860" end="00:33:45.980" style="s2">bring her aston that&#39;s bad our</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.000" end="00:33:48.320" style="s2">astronauts back man we&#39;re space stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.980" end="00:33:50.299" style="s2">right whoo Elon Musk just kidding it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.320" end="00:33:52.039" style="s2">multi re-entry vehicle weapon that drops</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.299" end="00:33:54.169" style="s2">eight nuclear weapons on saves once it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.039" end="00:33:56.150" style="s2">reaches peak orbit so this is the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.169" end="00:33:58.460" style="s2">research to get the same weapon and it</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.150" end="00:34:00.679" style="s2">never qualifies as military expenditure</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.460" end="00:34:02.539" style="s2">or more accurately the military</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.679" end="00:34:05.120" style="s2">expenditure for this is reduced because</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.539" end="00:34:08.419" style="s2">you have it&#39;s reallocated in these</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.120" end="00:34:11.090" style="s2">categories instead PlayStation 2 was</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.419" end="00:34:14.030" style="s2">actually classified as a dual use item</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.090" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">very strange so it&#39;s the same damn thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.030" end="00:34:21.379" style="s2">this was uh this was a clever piece of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:24.470" style="s2">legislation done I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.379" end="00:34:26.960" style="s2">Microsoft was pissed about this and they</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.470" end="00:34:29.750" style="s2">found a way to slap PlayStation 2 with</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.960" end="00:34:32.750" style="s2">the dual use as part of a so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.750" end="00:34:34.850" style="s2">put under different import-export rules</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.750" end="00:34:38.030" style="s2">so that they can get an advantage on</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.850" end="00:34:40.580" style="s2">Xbox there is it was total mess leave it</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.030" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">to Bill Gates surveillance capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.580" end="00:34:44.060" style="s2">which is what we all know we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:46.280" style="s2">I&#39;m talking to no camera right now right</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.060" end="00:34:49.100" style="s2">what is Silicon Valley the developer of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.280" end="00:34:51.679" style="s2">transistors and developer of AI and all</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.100" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">that software stuff well it&#39;s capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.679" end="00:34:56.840" style="s2">sure but well it&#39;s tyranny so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">dual-use thing any type of surveillance</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.840" end="00:35:00.410" style="s2">equipment that&#39;s developed for us and we</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.840" style="s2">you know we tell ourselves this is cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.410" end="00:35:04.550" style="s2">and we have a dog walker app well we</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.840" end="00:35:06.800" style="s2">also have apps that turn dogs into bombs</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.550" end="00:35:09.619" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s just you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.800" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">thing it&#39;s though use this all I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.619" end="00:35:14.720" style="s2">I&#39;m driving the point home here so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:16.369" style="s2">talk about robotic labor force build</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.720" end="00:35:18.380" style="s2">robots to build</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.369" end="00:35:20.450" style="s2">cool right and got that walking dog Jeff</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.380" end="00:35:23.059" style="s2">Bezos has that that&#39;s cute</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.450" end="00:35:25.609" style="s2">creepy but cute Boston Dynamics has this</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.059" end="00:35:28.519" style="s2">robot that&#39;s supposedly testing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.609" end="00:35:30.799" style="s2">clothes of of soldiers right but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.519" end="00:35:32.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a robotic labor force but the dual</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.799" end="00:35:35.359" style="s2">use is that it&#39;s a military force as</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.390" end="00:35:39.109" style="s2">well so dual use is a way to hide the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.359" end="00:35:42.680" style="s2">expenditures and once you start doing</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.109" end="00:35:45.079" style="s2">this game it becomes so useful that it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.680" end="00:35:49.729" style="s2">turns out you&#39;re powering your entire</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.079" end="00:35:51.170" style="s2">economy from this thing from this</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.729" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">mechanism alone you are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.170" end="00:35:56.749" style="s2">powering your entire you&#39;re driving the</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:59.029" style="s2">entire capital flows into your economy</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.749" end="00:36:01.849" style="s2">especially here I mean the dot-com I</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.029" end="00:36:04.249" style="s2">mean imagine if Google and Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.849" end="00:36:06.469" style="s2">all the blue chips in Silicon Valley hit</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.249" end="00:36:06.890" style="s2">like $20 a share we&#39;d be in the Stone</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.469" end="00:36:09.710" style="s2">Age</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.890" end="00:36:11.329" style="s2">so as these things expand they actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.710" end="00:36:15.109" style="s2">take over the economy because of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.329" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">trick here which then leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.109" end="00:36:19.759" style="s2">insane asylum so the other dual-use</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:22.609" style="s2">thing that I didn&#39;t get into is steal</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.759" end="00:36:26.839" style="s2">steal is a magical piece of metal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.609" end="00:36:28.579" style="s2">flexible it&#39;s hard it&#39;s powerful it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.839" end="00:36:30.589" style="s2">four it&#39;s a real-estate multiplier as</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.579" end="00:36:32.539" style="s2">you build like skyscrapers you turn one</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.589" end="00:36:34.099" style="s2">piece of land into like 30 pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.539" end="00:36:36.440" style="s2">land and you get multiples on your</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.099" end="00:36:38.809" style="s2">investment railroad can move stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.440" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">point A to point B pretty quick so now</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.809" end="00:36:44.150" style="s2">you can actually maximize the economy</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:46.969" style="s2">the economic performance of much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.150" end="00:36:48.200" style="s2">nodes in your civilian network so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.969" end="00:36:50.420" style="s2">gonna build steel everywhere it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.200" end="00:36:51.710" style="s2">magical just steel at it what do you</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.420" end="00:36:52.969" style="s2">want for Christmas kid I here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.710" end="00:36:55.460" style="s2">steel there&#39;s gonna throw steel</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.969" end="00:36:57.499" style="s2">everywhere and then it&#39;s so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.460" end="00:36:59.180" style="s2">that we&#39;ve already saturated all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.499" end="00:37:00.589" style="s2">possibilities in our own economy we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.180" end="00:37:02.809" style="s2">built every Bridge every skyscraper</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.589" end="00:37:05.059" style="s2">every railroad that could be even close</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.809" end="00:37:06.589" style="s2">to economically efficient now we got to</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.059" end="00:37:07.940" style="s2">spread it everywhere else we got a ship</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.589" end="00:37:09.229" style="s2">at the Germany we got to get the steel</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.940" end="00:37:10.609" style="s2">to Britain we got to get the steel to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.229" end="00:37:12.440" style="s2">India the steel the chine we got to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.609" end="00:37:13.789" style="s2">steal the whole place right no pun</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.440" end="00:37:15.619" style="s2">intended so we&#39;re going to put the steel</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.789" end="00:37:17.239" style="s2">everywhere which is great but because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.619" end="00:37:19.640" style="s2">mass produce so much steel at now just</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.239" end="00:37:21.049" style="s2">the precious drops we have done nothing</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.640" end="00:37:22.759" style="s2">but produced steel to the point that</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.049" end="00:37:25.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like 1 cents a pound because we</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.759" end="00:37:27.009" style="s2">made it so globally available</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.150" end="00:37:28.359" style="s2">well now we got an issue because steel</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.009" end="00:37:30.910" style="s2">production is actually pretty capital</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.359" end="00:37:31.930" style="s2">intense even if you spread it all over</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.910" end="00:37:33.279" style="s2">the world and people need their money</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.930" end="00:37:34.900" style="s2">back we got investors baby</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.279" end="00:37:37.269" style="s2">so how you gonna get that money back are</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.900" end="00:37:38.710" style="s2">you gonna recover that that massive</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.269" end="00:37:41.559" style="s2">heavy expenditure into your steel</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.710" end="00:37:43.480" style="s2">productions AHA I know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.559" end="00:37:45.099" style="s2">I can make weapons out of steel to blow</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.480" end="00:37:47.109" style="s2">up all the other steel things that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.099" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">built so I can increase the demand for</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.109" end="00:37:57.630" style="s2">steel later on this is called the insane</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:38:00.910" style="s2">asylum and we&#39;ve been here since 1940</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.630" end="00:38:02.950" style="s2">so this dual use we&#39;re building this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.910" end="00:38:04.420" style="s2">how dual use of all&#39;s when it gets real</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.950" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">circular when it turns into an aura</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.420" end="00:38:08.319" style="s2">Boris we get our dual use so cool we got</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">this thing we got this thing thing you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.319" end="00:38:12.910" style="s2">know we get here Steel&#39;s at its cheapest</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:14.920" style="s2">ah now we can start building weapons out</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.910" end="00:38:18.069" style="s2">of it we can the RN be out of it we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.920" end="00:38:19.779" style="s2">really experiment with it right so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.069" end="00:38:24.249" style="s2">is how you hide dual use and how you</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.779" end="00:38:25.380" style="s2">build these aura Boris&#39;s this is also</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.249" end="00:38:28.839" style="s2">known as the military-industrial complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.380" end="00:38:30.279" style="s2">but this is more of the control paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.839" end="00:38:33.579" style="s2">what I was talking about in the previous</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.279" end="00:38:36.190" style="s2">slide is the the economic insanity the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.579" end="00:38:38.759" style="s2">economic insane circle when you start</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.190" end="00:38:41.440" style="s2">taking tool used to its most efficient</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.759" end="00:38:42.970" style="s2">now in this case everybody knows in</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.440" end="00:38:44.140" style="s2">military-industrial complex let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.970" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">congressional consumer corporate</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.140" end="00:38:48.239" style="s2">surveillance complex and probably a</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:50.980" style="s2">bunch of other describers after that</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.239" end="00:38:52.660" style="s2">Congress has tax funding for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.980" end="00:38:54.460" style="s2">Department of Defense which in issues</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.660" end="00:38:56.289" style="s2">contracts to defense contractors who</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.289" end="00:39:01.119" style="s2">Congress and round around we go right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.690" end="00:39:03.579" style="s2">this is a driver for the this basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.119" end="00:39:04.809" style="s2">develops those dual use circles of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.579" end="00:39:07.299" style="s2">insanity that I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.809" end="00:39:08.440" style="s2">previously this is also known as</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.299" end="00:39:11.769" style="s2">military Keynesianism</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.440" end="00:39:16.059" style="s2">for ru economy nerds who want to take a</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.769" end="00:39:21.180" style="s2">crack at it so no let&#39;s let&#39;s keep this</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.059" end="00:39:25.390" style="s2">in mind for the next couple slides okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.180" end="00:39:28.029" style="s2">so this is where Intel&#39;s Moore and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.390" end="00:39:29.710" style="s2">Mikkel Foucault become the economy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.029" end="00:39:32.380" style="s2">gonna specifically talk in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.710" end="00:39:34.059" style="s2">surveillance capitalism this is the GDP</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.380" end="00:39:37.809" style="s2">per capita and this is median household</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.059" end="00:39:38.950" style="s2">income and this is often described as a</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.809" end="00:39:43.990" style="s2">wealth gap but that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.950" end="00:39:46.329" style="s2">not true it feels like a wealth gap but</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.990" end="00:39:48.250" style="s2">the reason it even formed is because we</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.329" end="00:39:50.200" style="s2">the Fed has a dual mandate Federal</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.250" end="00:39:52.660" style="s2">Reserve has a dual mandate to keep price</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.200" end="00:39:55.329" style="s2">can keep prices low and to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.660" end="00:39:58.119" style="s2">demand for the dollar high so what this</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.329" end="00:40:00.820" style="s2">is actually doing is this is proof that</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.119" end="00:40:03.010" style="s2">the Fed is doing its job this is proof</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.820" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">that the promise to keep cost of living</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.010" end="00:40:07.780" style="s2">price controls are in place is working</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:10.300" style="s2">because if you didn&#39;t have this line if</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.780" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">this if median household income</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.300" end="00:40:15.579" style="s2">increased as GDP per capita increased</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:17.710" style="s2">then what would happen is the price of</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.579" end="00:40:20.140" style="s2">everything would be crazy high you bet</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.710" end="00:40:22.180" style="s2">you&#39;d be paying big normos amounts of</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.140" end="00:40:24.339" style="s2">money for all kinds of stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.180" end="00:40:25.750" style="s2">therefore you be getting less consumer</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.339" end="00:40:28.300" style="s2">driven stuff and I mean I know I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.750" end="00:40:30.790" style="s2">1930s models here so if anyone&#39;s having</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.300" end="00:40:34.410" style="s2">an aneurysm and chat I apologize but</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.790" end="00:40:36.400" style="s2">this is this is this is proof that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.410" end="00:40:39.190" style="s2">cost-of-living promise is being</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.400" end="00:40:41.079" style="s2">respected be good and you can just go to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.190" end="00:40:42.790" style="s2">Walmart and see that I mean how often do</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.079" end="00:40:44.710" style="s2">it does Walmart prices change no change</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.790" end="00:40:46.060" style="s2">very much you can still go to Walmart</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.710" end="00:40:47.890" style="s2">and buy almost anything there to a</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.060" end="00:40:49.540" style="s2">degree put it on layaway or a credit</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.890" end="00:40:50.140" style="s2">card for more pricey items but the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.540" end="00:40:52.750" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.140" end="00:40:55.270" style="s2">Walmart&#39;s even accessible to most human</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.750" end="00:40:57.010" style="s2">beings and in the country is because of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.270" end="00:40:58.599" style="s2">the price the cost of living a price</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.010" end="00:41:00.790" style="s2">control promise that&#39;s implied and what</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.599" end="00:41:03.460" style="s2">the Federal Reserve mandate is and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.790" end="00:41:04.810" style="s2">gap is proof that it&#39;s working so it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.460" end="00:41:09.069" style="s2">looks like a wealth gap but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.810" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">actually policy so how do you get that</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.069" end="00:41:14.980" style="s2">how you keep that gap increasing or how</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:19.750" style="s2">do you keep that precaution in check</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.980" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">well you gotta use technology to produce</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.750" end="00:41:26.530" style="s2">more goods at cheaper rates and if your</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:29.050" style="s2">country has full of unions or its full</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.530" end="00:41:30.760" style="s2">of people who are expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.050" end="00:41:32.140" style="s2">professionals then just ship that</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.760" end="00:41:33.640" style="s2">somewhere else buddy we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.140" end="00:41:35.829" style="s2">we&#39;re going to China we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.640" end="00:41:37.390" style="s2">Thailand Vietnam India man and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.829" end="00:41:39.790" style="s2">notice as we go to these countries its</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.390" end="00:41:41.380" style="s2">1960 and modernization happens and look</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.790" end="00:41:44.010" style="s2">at that the exports as percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.380" end="00:41:46.900" style="s2">their GDP starts to skyrocket meanwhile</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.010" end="00:41:48.700" style="s2">GDP per capita goes up because financial</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.900" end="00:41:50.050" style="s2">services take over the economy because</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.700" end="00:41:52.500" style="s2">they&#39;re managing this growth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.050" end="00:41:54.089" style="s2">everybody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.500" end="00:41:56.460" style="s2">the cost of living is held its</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.089" end="00:42:00.119" style="s2">maintained because we are basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.460" end="00:42:01.650" style="s2">deferring the met the state production</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.119" end="00:42:02.819" style="s2">costs not wages I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.650" end="00:42:05.309" style="s2">incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.819" end="00:42:07.410" style="s2">the production costs are being held in</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.309" end="00:42:13.140" style="s2">line in relation to this so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.410" end="00:42:15.809" style="s2">get this this in turn leads to Moore&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.140" end="00:42:17.400" style="s2">law because we have outsourced a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.809" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">the cop we&#39;ve outsourced a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.400" end="00:42:25.109" style="s2">tinier the the more I&#39;m sorry we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:27.660" style="s2">outsourced the less complicated stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.109" end="00:42:29.910" style="s2">other nations that are on the rise in</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.660" end="00:42:32.130" style="s2">terms of development we&#39;re able to then</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.910" end="00:42:33.660" style="s2">take some of these people from here</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.130" end="00:42:36.420" style="s2">specifically the people who are managing</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.660" end="00:42:38.130" style="s2">this line and get them and retrain them</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.420" end="00:42:40.680" style="s2">to start looking into information</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.130" end="00:42:42.440" style="s2">manufacturing so that&#39;s like that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.680" end="00:42:46.230" style="s2">Silicon Valley that&#39;s like chip</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.440" end="00:42:47.970" style="s2">production that&#39;s semiconductors all</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.230" end="00:42:49.410" style="s2">those types of things so we&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.970" end="00:42:51.869" style="s2">because of this system we were able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.410" end="00:42:54.240" style="s2">start really developing Moore&#39;s law as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.869" end="00:42:56.490" style="s2">byproduct of this because this requires</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.240" end="00:42:59.130" style="s2">more and more research into crazy crazy</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.490" end="00:43:01.170" style="s2">stuff in order to even get to this point</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.130" end="00:43:03.540" style="s2">although we&#39;re starting to hit serious</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.170" end="00:43:05.460" style="s2">problems probably around this point and</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.540" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">that&#39;s because just quantum physics is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.460" end="00:43:09.630" style="s2">total pain in the ass so so these two</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:11.520" style="s2">things have a significant impact on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.630" end="00:43:13.109" style="s2">development of this so if any one of</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.520" end="00:43:14.609" style="s2">these go out of whack you can start</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.109" end="00:43:15.900" style="s2">seeing this number to go down as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.609" end="00:43:17.910" style="s2">that should be and that should be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.900" end="00:43:19.230" style="s2">pretty that&#39;s pretty a pretty solid</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.910" end="00:43:23.549" style="s2">indicator according to what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.230" end="00:43:25.619" style="s2">proposing here which of course leads to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.549" end="00:43:31.559" style="s2">economic because we have more</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.619" end="00:43:32.490" style="s2">information processes more hear me out</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.559" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">real quick</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.490" end="00:43:37.020" style="s2">we got Moore&#39;s Law and it&#39;s creating</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">more and more transistors and more and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.020" end="00:43:40.440" style="s2">more information processing and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:42.869" style="s2">basically quantizing human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.440" end="00:43:44.190" style="s2">that&#39;s basically what the 1990s onward</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.869" end="00:43:47.130" style="s2">has been all growth has been about</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.190" end="00:43:50.970" style="s2">quantizing human behavior for financial</p>

<p begin="00:43:56.369" end="00:44:02.369" style="s2">been driven primarily by the fidelity</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.930" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">why is that happening one but</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.230" end="00:44:18.690" style="s2">obvious so it turns out that when you</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.990" end="00:44:20.670" style="s2">keep people poor here and everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.690" end="00:44:22.440" style="s2">getting rich that tends to cause social</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.670" end="00:44:25.590" style="s2">friction weird a weird relationship</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.440" end="00:44:28.470" style="s2">right even though this system can be</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.590" end="00:44:29.970" style="s2">explained as this is actually not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.470" end="00:44:31.170" style="s2">deal for most people it certainly</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.970" end="00:44:32.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t feel like that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.170" end="00:44:35.460" style="s2">especially when you can&#39;t pay your</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.610" end="00:44:36.780" style="s2">medical bills or whatever happens but</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.460" end="00:44:39.990" style="s2">this was the promise of the Fed this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.780" end="00:44:42.030" style="s2">what they said they would do so and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.990" end="00:44:44.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a more insidious part about</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.030" end="00:44:47.670" style="s2">price controls because we&#39;re keeping not</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.730" end="00:44:49.170" style="s2">necessarily the the production side here</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.670" end="00:44:50.880" style="s2">we&#39;ve already outsourced most of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.170" end="00:44:52.650" style="s2">hard production here but this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.880" end="00:44:55.250" style="s2">consumption for us right so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.650" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">cost of living so this is consuming</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.250" end="00:45:00.840" style="s2">there&#39;s also a an insidious friction</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:03.990" style="s2">that is not internal it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.840" end="00:45:06.120" style="s2">external meaning I have either a cheap</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.990" end="00:45:08.910" style="s2">labor pool or a cheap consumer pool and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.120" end="00:45:09.680" style="s2">now other nations want to take it for</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.910" end="00:45:12.600" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.680" end="00:45:14.970" style="s2">so think when when America went into</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.600" end="00:45:16.560" style="s2">Japan and we said hey Commodore Perry&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.970" end="00:45:18.210" style="s2">here and you&#39;re gonna open your market</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.560" end="00:45:20.340" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna shoot all of you well</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.210" end="00:45:21.990" style="s2">there you go that&#39;s an example of you</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.340" end="00:45:24.450" style="s2">know taking someone else&#39;s labor pool</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.990" end="00:45:27.000" style="s2">and taking someone else&#39;s markets so as</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.450" end="00:45:29.400" style="s2">you get better control of your human</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.000" end="00:45:33.390" style="s2">behavior you start attracting the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.400" end="00:45:35.220" style="s2">sociopaths and so you think you need</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.390" end="00:45:37.230" style="s2">more of this and you need more of this</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.220" end="00:45:40.290" style="s2">to keep these guys away but by making</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.230" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">more of this these guys get better so</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.290" end="00:45:45.180" style="s2">this system this doesn&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">so this is where game a has some serious</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.180" end="00:45:51.000" style="s2">problems off the cliff it goes you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:54.150" style="s2">think it goes off the cliff I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.000" end="00:45:57.780" style="s2">count I wouldn&#39;t it can tap out but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.150" end="00:45:59.670" style="s2">not going to and so I&#39;ll explain why it</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.780" end="00:46:03.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to and that&#39;s primarily</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.670" end="00:46:07.020" style="s2">because of opportunism so let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.390" end="00:46:09.270" style="s2">jiu-jitsu in the morn for Colt dojo it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.259" end="00:46:42.420" style="s2">yellow cake thing and that was supposed</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.519" end="00:46:44.069" style="s2">to justify going into here Brussels is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.420" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">like damn oil dark</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.069" end="00:46:49.769" style="s2">damn it you&#39;re supposed to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:52.559" style="s2">screw up our petrol your own damn it so</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.769" end="00:46:56.849" style="s2">now everyone has to go into Iraq and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.559" end="00:46:58.499" style="s2">it&#39;s a multi coalition force for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.849" end="00:47:00.809" style="s2">most but you notice it&#39;s like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.499" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">surgically removed Saudi Arabia from</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.809" end="00:47:05.160" style="s2">this whole thing the rest of the region</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.660" style="s2">is completely trashed by the way because</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.160" end="00:47:09.479" style="s2">we go into Iraq and so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.660" end="00:47:12.410" style="s2">sectarian strife boom Shiites and Sunnis</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.479" end="00:47:15.299" style="s2">just completely decimating one another</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.410" end="00:47:16.950" style="s2">mostly because of the D radicalization</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.299" end="00:47:19.469" style="s2">technology we&#39;ve been using but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.950" end="00:47:21.450" style="s2">another conversation for another time of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.469" end="00:47:24.089" style="s2">course not Saudi Arabia though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.450" end="00:47:25.380" style="s2">okay in fact they&#39;re quite happy with</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.089" end="00:47:26.910" style="s2">this arrangement because they&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.380" end="00:47:28.890" style="s2">make their competition for oil</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.910" end="00:47:30.900" style="s2">production murder each other they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.890" end="00:47:32.819" style="s2">have an army that&#39;s worth a damn but</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.900" end="00:47:37.829" style="s2">they have our army because they have our</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.819" end="00:47:40.380" style="s2">oil so put two and two together right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.829" end="00:47:43.289" style="s2">what does this do well this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.380" end="00:47:44.249" style="s2">like 30 years war but for this region of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.289" end="00:47:46.140" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.249" end="00:47:48.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just neighbors murdering neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.140" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">they don&#39;t tell you that in the media</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.900" end="00:47:51.630" style="s2">but that&#39;s what&#39;s going on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.940" style="s2">what&#39;s driving a lot of the immigration</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.630" end="00:47:56.489" style="s2">to Europe is because of that mess</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.940" end="00:47:59.539" style="s2">everyone anyone who&#39;s migraine year sans</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.489" end="00:48:03.119" style="s2">the obvious radicals who were trained</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.539" end="00:48:05.249" style="s2">under you know spooky conditions but</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:08.999" style="s2">people who are moving here and aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.249" end="00:48:09.930" style="s2">radicalized their neighbors they realize</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.999" end="00:48:11.099" style="s2">their neighbors aren&#39;t seeing their</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.930" end="00:48:13.140" style="s2">opportunities are gone they basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.099" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">have to sell their labor to where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.140" end="00:48:16.200" style="s2">stable to where this kind of crap isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.630" style="s2">happening so of course you&#39;re gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.200" end="00:48:20.509" style="s2">to Europe it&#39;s it&#39;s like a bus ride or a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.630" end="00:48:23.009" style="s2">boat ride and you get the Europe right</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.509" end="00:48:24.329" style="s2">look German Karen there she is she&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.009" end="00:48:25.619" style="s2">queen of all that&#39;s morale now she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.329" end="00:48:28.650" style="s2">gonna take them all in look at her go</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.619" end="00:48:31.589" style="s2">right she&#39;s the she&#39;s the real she&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.650" end="00:48:33.440" style="s2">real MVP right just kidding Germany gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.589" end="00:48:35.900" style="s2">cheap labor in 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.440" end="00:48:38.120" style="s2">that&#39;s the real play so this is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.900" end="00:48:40.790" style="s2">example of taking these moments of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.120" end="00:48:45.020" style="s2">instability as game a screws up and</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.790" end="00:48:46.730" style="s2">turning those into gold for game a so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.020" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">could do this all day it has been doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.730" end="00:48:49.460" style="s2">this this is what it does this is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:52.540" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.460" end="00:48:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;s jiu-jitsu in this dojo of insanity</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.540" end="00:48:56.120" style="s2">it&#39;s how do you roll at the moment how</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.800" end="00:48:57.290" style="s2">do you how do you get the maximum</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.120" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">opportunity out of this stuff so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.290" end="00:49:01.220" style="s2">always seeking for that type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:03.530" style="s2">and it has no problems just placing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.220" end="00:49:05.450" style="s2">entire populations that&#39;s just the mo</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.530" end="00:49:07.510" style="s2">that&#39;s just what they do right it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.450" end="00:49:11.540" style="s2">that way forever</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.510" end="00:49:13.310" style="s2">so this is why game a can stay on life</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.540" end="00:49:15.530" style="s2">support you could do this forever and</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.310" end="00:49:17.390" style="s2">has done this forever I wouldn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.530" end="00:49:19.730" style="s2">they just kind of wake up and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.390" end="00:49:23.630" style="s2">have a crisis of conscience I would not</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.730" end="00:49:25.220" style="s2">assume that&#39;s the case so let&#39;s instead</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.630" end="00:49:29.150" style="s2">look at what game a can do if they were</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.220" end="00:49:31.610" style="s2">smart and that involves robotic</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.150" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">nationalism so what is robotic</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.610" end="00:49:35.030" style="s2">nationalism well it&#39;s the dual use</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:39.470" style="s2">concept that we&#39;ve described in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.030" end="00:49:42.770" style="s2">previous slides where we intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.470" end="00:49:44.600" style="s2">create robotic soldiers so that the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.770" end="00:49:47.750" style="s2">robotic soldiers go to war with each</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.600" end="00:49:50.510" style="s2">other so that every time a robotic</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.750" end="00:49:54.650" style="s2">soldier gets shot down it creates 50 to</p>

<p begin="00:50:13.760" end="00:50:17.570" style="s2">through us doing this we did this with</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.170" end="00:50:19.940" style="s2">Steel except you know we killed people</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.570" end="00:50:21.290" style="s2">to do it mostly the uneducated and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.940" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">criminals and all those type of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.290" end="00:50:23.570" style="s2">but you celebrate them as heroes later</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:26.690" style="s2">on that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.570" end="00:50:28.610" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m proposing is that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.690" end="00:50:32.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have to kill anybody nobody has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.610" end="00:50:34.040" style="s2">die so let&#39;s look at where those</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.900" end="00:50:37.060" style="s2">hotspots kick off</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.040" end="00:50:37.060" style="s2">let&#39;s see what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.390" end="00:50:40.940" style="s2">conscription and corruption are</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.230" end="00:50:42.710" style="s2">difficult things to merge together</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.940" end="00:50:44.360" style="s2">there&#39;s different types of corruption</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.710" end="00:50:46.160" style="s2">you can have corruption at the federal</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.360" end="00:50:47.900" style="s2">level where you don&#39;t trust your federal</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.160" end="00:50:50.060" style="s2">leaders like say most people don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.900" end="00:50:51.290" style="s2">Trump or you can have corruption at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.060" end="00:50:53.150" style="s2">local level where you don&#39;t trust your</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.290" end="00:50:54.650" style="s2">local police department it&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.150" end="00:50:56.390" style="s2">perceptions depending upon where you go</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.650" end="00:50:58.690" style="s2">and it can be a mix of both totally</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.390" end="00:51:00.680" style="s2">possible so I&#39;m just going to use I</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.690" end="00:51:03.040" style="s2">forget where I got this chart from</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.680" end="00:51:05.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter we&#39;re just gonna use a</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.040" end="00:51:07.940" style="s2">corruption index because they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.060" end="00:51:10.460" style="s2">just made up anyway I&#39;m gonna see if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.940" end="00:51:12.560" style="s2">can find countries that are drafting who</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.460" end="00:51:15.800" style="s2">are doing mostly mail drafts the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.560" end="00:51:18.170" style="s2">exception of these guys and and it this</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.800" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">also doesn&#39;t show the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.170" end="00:51:25.700" style="s2">compulsory drafting and volunteers like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:29.360" style="s2">turkey is compulsory and I think Russia</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.700" end="00:51:32.900" style="s2">is volunteer I forget but everyone signs</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.360" end="00:51:34.610" style="s2">it for like selective service in some</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.900" end="00:51:38.600" style="s2">capacity it can be caught upon later on</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.610" end="00:51:40.790" style="s2">but these are America has that but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.600" end="00:51:43.120" style="s2">talking about like military draft it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.790" end="00:51:45.770" style="s2">always active it&#39;s part of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.120" end="00:51:47.720" style="s2">so now let&#39;s identify places where the</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.770" end="00:51:49.790" style="s2">draft is going on and corruption is</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.720" end="00:51:52.010" style="s2">really high the lower the number the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.790" end="00:51:53.420" style="s2">higher it is right so looking at the Old</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.010" end="00:51:58.250" style="s2">Kingdom of course we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.420" end="00:52:00.110" style="s2">Turkey looking at Russia they were</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.250" end="00:52:02.360" style="s2">looking at Mexico right so what we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.110" end="00:52:04.280" style="s2">here is a case where if the leaders of</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.360" end="00:52:06.050" style="s2">that country say hey we need to draft</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.280" end="00:52:07.130" style="s2">you because of a war there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.050" end="00:52:09.350" style="s2">chance that people are gonna be like</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.130" end="00:52:11.660" style="s2"> right off I&#39;m not going to do that</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.350" end="00:52:14.630" style="s2">because you&#39;re corrupt and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.660" end="00:52:17.510" style="s2">right so now your military draft is less</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.630" end="00:52:18.950" style="s2">of a nationalized galvanizing moment and</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.510" end="00:52:21.500" style="s2">it&#39;s more of like well we&#39;ll pick who we</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.950" end="00:52:23.050" style="s2">can get right so this means that these</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.500" end="00:52:24.359" style="s2">nations in particular are really</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.050" end="00:52:27.809" style="s2">susceptible</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.359" end="00:52:29.700" style="s2">- requesting robotic soldiers because</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.809" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">they can&#39;t draft enough people because</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.700" end="00:52:32.190" style="s2">they&#39;re corrupt and they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:34.559" style="s2">fix their corruption there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.190" end="00:52:37.259" style="s2">money so these these are hot spots to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.559" end="00:52:39.089" style="s2">bring robots in because they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.259" end="00:52:40.170" style="s2">greedy and they and their people know</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.089" end="00:52:41.759" style="s2">they&#39;re greedy and that people want</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.170" end="00:52:43.559" style="s2">nothing to do with that game so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.759" end="00:52:45.269" style="s2">gonna bring the robots in now it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.559" end="00:52:47.160" style="s2">true in the inverse it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.269" end="00:52:50.249" style="s2">corruption that&#39;s a driver for a robotic</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.160" end="00:52:51.749" style="s2">warfare demand it&#39;s also success that</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.249" end="00:52:54.089" style="s2">sounds weird but let me give you an</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.749" end="00:52:57.299" style="s2">example these are the number of</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.089" end="00:52:59.549" style="s2">deferments between 1948 and 2005 I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.299" end="00:53:02.549" style="s2">tell you the country yet but you might</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.549" end="00:53:04.349" style="s2">notice that deferments are when people</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.549" end="00:53:05.999" style="s2">are drafted but they say yeah I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.349" end="00:53:07.380" style="s2">go I want to go to college or I want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.999" end="00:53:09.269" style="s2">go start a business or do something</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.380" end="00:53:11.400" style="s2">right so I want to do something other</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.269" end="00:53:12.930" style="s2">than and I want to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.400" end="00:53:14.279" style="s2">civilian economy instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.930" end="00:53:17.039" style="s2">drafted so these deferments are just</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.279" end="00:53:19.319" style="s2">going way up over time and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.039" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">causing that I have unaccountable power</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.319" end="00:53:23.700" style="s2">influencers you see these people getting</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:24.930" style="s2">money I want money to I want to play</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.700" end="00:53:28.079" style="s2">that game I want to make the money game</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.930" end="00:53:30.450" style="s2">so why am i serving I make some money</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.079" end="00:53:32.609" style="s2">you have entitled civil servants who are</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.450" end="00:53:35.489" style="s2">ok with these deferments usually they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.609" end="00:53:37.470" style="s2">like you should not be deferring go</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.489" end="00:53:39.809" style="s2">serve your country but they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.470" end="00:53:41.910" style="s2">money - so it right and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.809" end="00:53:43.529" style="s2">the citizenry is just so they don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.910" end="00:53:46.019" style="s2">care they have no national identity</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.529" end="00:53:49.559" style="s2">there&#39;s like it right oh what</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.019" end="00:53:51.569" style="s2">country am I talking about here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.559" end="00:53:53.460" style="s2">talking about Israel those are the</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.569" end="00:53:55.109" style="s2">numbers for Israel that is a country</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.460" end="00:53:56.730" style="s2">that has been at war since its founding</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.109" end="00:53:58.710" style="s2">all of its neighbors want to kill it and</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.730" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">what&#39;s happening there success which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.710" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">a very successful country BYE MOM</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:05.039" style="s2">modern metrics they don&#39;t want to fight</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:06.869" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.039" end="00:54:09.329" style="s2">these citizens do not want to</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.869" end="00:54:11.339" style="s2">participate in the military draft so</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.329" end="00:54:13.829" style="s2">their own success is actually gutting</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.339" end="00:54:16.349" style="s2">their own military surprisingly which</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.829" end="00:54:19.259" style="s2">means you&#39;re gonna need robots to fill</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.349" end="00:54:21.239" style="s2">the gaps all the neighbors want to kill</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.259" end="00:54:23.759" style="s2">them probably vice versa you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.239" end="00:54:25.739" style="s2">some robots for that so either high P</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.759" end="00:54:27.660" style="s2">heavy corruption or heavy success we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.739" end="00:54:31.410" style="s2">both Drive robotic warfare in either</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.660" end="00:54:33.930" style="s2">case because the demand to fill you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.410" end="00:54:36.010" style="s2">person online with gun has to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.930" end="00:54:38.869" style="s2">fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.010" end="00:54:41.750" style="s2">so then let&#39;s talk about how to take</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.869" end="00:54:43.970" style="s2">this concept and scale it across the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.750" end="00:54:45.710" style="s2">entire planet not just the hot spots not</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.970" end="00:54:48.740" style="s2">just the exceptions but make it</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.710" end="00:54:50.150" style="s2">everywhere at the same time here&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.740" end="00:54:53.480" style="s2">favorite fat cat we all like to make fun</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.150" end="00:54:56.450" style="s2">of because we&#39;re poor and reliable Pei</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.480" end="00:54:59.630" style="s2">Pei Royal citizens we need to crush to</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.450" end="00:55:01.430" style="s2">rally the enemy not you&#39;re a reptilian</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.630" end="00:55:03.190" style="s2">putable off right so they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.430" end="00:55:06.440" style="s2">doing that stuff they&#39;re not feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.190" end="00:55:07.700" style="s2">so uh we already know the enlistment is</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.440" end="00:55:09.500" style="s2">gonna be low so they got to hire</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.700" end="00:55:10.970" style="s2">mercenaries they&#39;re gonna reach for</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.500" end="00:55:13.340" style="s2">mercenaries first we&#39;re gonna go to Z</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.970" end="00:55:16.520" style="s2">Blackwater and triple-canopy in those</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.340" end="00:55:17.780" style="s2">kind of people and pay for pew pew comm</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.520" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">and that type of stuff so you could</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.780" end="00:55:21.950" style="s2">bring in your dudes and you know shoot</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:23.510" style="s2">mercenaries they&#39;re not loyal</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.950" end="00:55:28.130" style="s2">they don&#39;t necessarily fight to the last</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.510" end="00:55:28.610" style="s2">man but they shoot people so that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.130" end="00:55:30.740" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.610" end="00:55:34.190" style="s2">so oh look it&#39;s Erik Prince look at him</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.740" end="00:55:37.970" style="s2">happy business but this Erik Prince</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.190" end="00:55:40.760" style="s2">laughs you never research this guy this</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.970" end="00:55:42.560" style="s2">guy&#39;s a cutthroat business dude in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.760" end="00:55:46.250" style="s2">traditional mercenary sense for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.560" end="00:55:47.840" style="s2">a history of mercenaries yes there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:24.570" style="s2">robots I&#39;m Serbia now I need robots now</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.830" end="00:59:28.470" style="s2">everybody needs robots and just spreads</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.570" end="00:59:30.090" style="s2">right now their citizens don&#39;t care you</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.470" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">know they&#39;re quite happy the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.090" end="00:59:33.750" style="s2">they have jobs oh great more robot</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:35.130" style="s2">infrastructure 5g you or whatever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.750" end="00:59:36.630" style="s2">building I&#39;m building all my</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.130" end="00:59:40.920" style="s2">infrastructure I&#39;m getting jobs in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.630" end="00:59:42.570" style="s2">mass unemployment scenario great then</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.920" end="00:59:43.950" style="s2">they&#39;re staring at each other realizing</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.570" end="00:59:45.450" style="s2">they&#39;re probably locked in his robot</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.950" end="00:59:46.950" style="s2">building arms race because now they both</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.450" end="00:59:48.210" style="s2">have robotic soldiers they&#39;re corrupt as</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.950" end="00:59:50.310" style="s2">hell they&#39;re not getting peels these</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.210" end="00:59:52.650" style="s2">people are not joining the military</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.310" end="00:59:53.760" style="s2">anytime soon despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.650" end="00:59:55.230" style="s2">they&#39;re impoverished because now they</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.760" end="00:59:56.610" style="s2">have a vehicle to get jobs and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.230" end="00:59:58.620" style="s2">participate in their economy so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.610" end="01:00:01.410" style="s2">certainly not going to join the military</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.620" end="01:00:03.600" style="s2">in bulk not like a conscription allows</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.410" end="01:00:05.730" style="s2">and now these guys have to build robots</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.600" end="01:00:08.220" style="s2">because they rely more and more on the</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.730" end="01:00:09.870" style="s2">robotic forces for defense and less and</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.220" end="01:00:13.800" style="s2">less than human you know meat shield</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.870" end="01:00:15.690" style="s2">participation so now we gotta build the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.800" end="01:00:19.530" style="s2">robots today I got robots in that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.690" end="01:00:21.030" style="s2">takes work so now that&#39;s more jobs and</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.530" end="01:00:22.590" style="s2">then you start dropping suggestions</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.030" end="01:00:25.020" style="s2">think you know how it&#39;d be a real shame</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.590" end="01:00:26.640" style="s2">if these guys want the war they</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.020" end="01:00:28.170" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t go to war you know war will be</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.640" end="01:00:30.150" style="s2">a bad idea I sure hope they don&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.170" end="01:00:31.770" style="s2">war cuz cuz war would would destabilize</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.150" end="01:00:33.150" style="s2">everything and you just keep saying war</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.770" end="01:00:36.120" style="s2">over and over again before you know what</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.150" end="01:00:39.450" style="s2">someone starts thinking war that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.120" end="01:00:41.790" style="s2">great right I got a robot war for</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.450" end="01:00:44.250" style="s2">whatever reason maybe it&#39;s uh maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.790" end="01:00:46.590" style="s2">guy hates this guy or or whichever the</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.250" end="01:00:48.420" style="s2">case may be something initially pops off</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.590" end="01:00:50.040" style="s2">organically some dumb stuff you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.420" end="01:00:52.800" style="s2">have to you know put economic hitman</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.040" end="01:00:55.170" style="s2">there but in the back of everyone&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.800" end="01:00:57.090" style="s2">they start to realize a conclusion they</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.170" end="01:00:59.910" style="s2">start to realize that every robot that</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.090" end="01:01:05.330" style="s2">dies in this war is 30 to 70 jobs for</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.910" end="01:01:09.720" style="s2">everyone involved and so now instead of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.330" end="01:01:13.110" style="s2">all those jobs again jobs everywhere no</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.720" end="01:01:14.760" style="s2">we got our jobs back so this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.110" end="01:01:16.320" style="s2">the conclusion that&#39;s reached once this</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.760" end="01:01:18.240" style="s2">kicks off and other people</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.320" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">see it and they&#39;ll go I want 100%</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.240" end="01:01:22.080" style="s2">employment too because all my people are</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:27.540" style="s2">burning down minutes Minneapolis right</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.080" end="01:01:29.340" style="s2">now so here&#39;s a way out of that type of</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.540" end="01:01:32.010" style="s2">problem and everyone&#39;s gonna see this</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.340" end="01:01:34.890" style="s2">all it has to do is work once once this</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.010" end="01:01:37.230" style="s2">conclusion is even tasted just once</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.890" end="01:01:38.730" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna see the whole shift you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.230" end="01:01:40.740" style="s2">gonna see the entire interpretation of</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.730" end="01:01:43.470" style="s2">economic shift towards its robotic</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.740" end="01:01:47.340" style="s2">military Keynesianism and steer policy</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.470" end="01:01:49.800" style="s2">towards it to then keep civilian</p>

<p begin="01:01:54.480" end="01:01:59.490" style="s2">and also I already covered jobs and debt</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.450" end="01:02:01.890" style="s2">that&#39;s that just those three alone is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.490" end="01:02:03.870" style="s2">enough to really fundamentally alter the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.890" end="01:02:05.610" style="s2">order of how the world organizes itself</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.870" end="01:02:07.940" style="s2">especially if America was to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.610" end="01:02:11.400" style="s2">disengage from all of its previous</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.940" end="01:02:13.530" style="s2">responsibilities this is certainly on</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.400" end="01:02:15.990" style="s2">the table as an option whether it works</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.530" end="01:02:17.430" style="s2">or not well let&#39;s look into what happens</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.990" end="01:02:20.160" style="s2">here oh look it&#39;s everybody&#39;s favorite</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.430" end="01:02:22.680" style="s2">red or he&#39;s out here he&#39;s very convinced</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.160" end="01:02:24.990" style="s2">that this all sounds nice and well but</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.680" end="01:02:26.580" style="s2">what if they take robots and dump them</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.990" end="01:02:28.620" style="s2">in a population center so what if they</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.580" end="01:02:31.410" style="s2">don&#39;t you know what if they don&#39;t steer</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.620" end="01:02:33.930" style="s2">themselves towards this ideal state</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.410" end="01:02:35.610" style="s2">where it&#39;s robots versus robots what if</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.930" end="01:02:36.720" style="s2">they decide to pull a Hitler and say</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.610" end="01:02:38.670" style="s2">well I&#39;m just going to invade your</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.720" end="01:02:39.930" style="s2">population centers and it all right</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.670" end="01:02:41.580" style="s2">that&#39;s a feasible that&#39;s a feasible</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.930" end="01:02:42.870" style="s2">thing you could do that those robots are</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.580" end="01:02:44.520" style="s2">cheap and population centers are</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.870" end="01:02:45.870" style="s2">expensive and so there&#39;s soft targets</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.520" end="01:02:47.430" style="s2">and you&#39;d hit them hard and of course as</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.870" end="01:02:49.770" style="s2">an obvious advantage for that in a total</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.430" end="01:02:52.260" style="s2">war scenario of course but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.770" end="01:02:54.060" style="s2">exterminators and I got 18 billion</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.260" end="01:02:56.280" style="s2">reasons why this works these</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.060" end="01:02:58.470" style="s2"> are off the table meaning</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.280" end="01:03:01.350" style="s2">that&#39;s Prince oh ye</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.470" end="01:03:03.000" style="s2">he&#39;s 18 billion dollar net value he was</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.350" end="01:03:05.700" style="s2">hung upside down and had the kicked</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.000" end="01:03:08.670" style="s2">out of him for six weeks straight this</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.700" end="01:03:10.830" style="s2">is Clare Bronfman she ran at a sex cult</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.670" end="01:03:12.420" style="s2">slash human trafficking thing she&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.830" end="01:03:14.130" style="s2">in court ever since Trump got elected</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.420" end="01:03:17.610" style="s2">and we all know who these guys are</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.130" end="01:03:20.730" style="s2">so all these Untouchables we can touch</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.610" end="01:03:22.080" style="s2">them so any one of these people decide</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.730" end="01:03:24.900" style="s2">to step out of line and start throwing</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.080" end="01:03:28.260" style="s2">robots at humans we can touch you</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.900" end="01:03:30.170" style="s2">we have 19 billion reasons and 19</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.260" end="01:03:32.130" style="s2">billion reasons why we can touch you</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.170" end="01:03:34.470" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t matter how much money you</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.130" end="01:03:37.740" style="s2">got you can get exterminated we&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.470" end="01:03:39.420" style="s2">you off the table no problem so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.740" end="01:03:40.800" style="s2">really concerned about this one cuz</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.420" end="01:03:42.450" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s trying to put that together</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.800" end="01:03:43.710" style="s2">they can be taken off the table</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.450" end="01:03:45.360" style="s2">so what we do it we can update our</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.710" end="01:03:47.240" style="s2">Geneva protocols and say robot versus</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.360" end="01:03:49.140" style="s2">human is a war crime we don&#39;t want that</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.240" end="01:03:50.580" style="s2">that we&#39;re not out here trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.140" end="01:03:53.130" style="s2">exterminate everybody and fulfill</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.580" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">Malthus and that whole group we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.130" end="01:03:56.700" style="s2">interested in making sure that if these</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:59.520" style="s2">robots are coming let&#39;s put this thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.700" end="01:04:01.020" style="s2">on a sane leash and say hey how can we</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.520" end="01:04:02.340" style="s2">benefit from humans these robots are</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.020" end="01:04:06.510" style="s2">coming with or without it you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.340" end="01:04:07.980" style="s2">dig your head in the sand and be like no</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.510" end="01:04:10.080" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re here just work</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.980" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">it out let&#39;s start here let&#39;s make this</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.080" end="01:04:14.120" style="s2">a war crime you can totally do this</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:16.500" style="s2">you&#39;re not forbidding the creation of</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.120" end="01:04:18.450" style="s2">robotic war machines but we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.500" end="01:04:22.320" style="s2">when you deploy them on humans it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.450" end="01:04:24.480" style="s2">war crime and if you disagree out you go</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.320" end="01:04:28.260" style="s2">get out of our system we want nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.480" end="01:04:31.080" style="s2">do with you so now let&#39;s talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.260" end="01:04:32.610" style="s2">other problem which is unemployment as</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.080" end="01:04:35.400" style="s2">you put more robots in you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.610" end="01:04:38.130" style="s2">less demand for people right and study</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.400" end="01:04:41.330" style="s2">have to study tends to show this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.130" end="01:04:44.070" style="s2">looking at these circle radiuses imply</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.330" end="01:04:47.280" style="s2">commuting zones so larger cities have</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.070" end="01:04:48.960" style="s2">bigger circles etc and you look at this</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.280" end="01:04:51.000" style="s2">trend when you take all the bubble</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.960" end="01:04:53.640" style="s2">graphs and you know you walk down the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.000" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">median and you&#39;ll see that you do have</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.640" end="01:04:59.640" style="s2">more unemployment as you move along the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:05:01.860" style="s2">line as more robot use happens so you</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.640" end="01:05:03.900" style="s2">have less robot use and it&#39;s funny you</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.860" end="01:05:05.370" style="s2">actually have spikes of severe</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.900" end="01:05:08.550" style="s2">unemployment when you have less robot</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.370" end="01:05:10.410" style="s2">use and then you get to a more steady</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.550" end="01:05:12.300" style="s2">predictable unemployment when you get</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.410" end="01:05:13.590" style="s2">more robot use which is there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.300" end="01:05:16.170" style="s2">some funds that can benefit from that</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.590" end="01:05:17.070" style="s2">surprisingly but here&#39;s a key</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.170" end="01:05:18.540" style="s2">distinction here right</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.070" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">everybody says unemployment this</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.540" end="01:05:23.010" style="s2">unemployment that robots gonna do</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:25.860" style="s2">anything this word private real quick</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.010" end="01:05:27.840" style="s2">it&#39;s a private employment goes down</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.860" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">didn&#39;t say public employment goes down</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.840" end="01:05:32.910" style="s2">now I&#39;m talking robotic nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:35.910" style="s2">where robots are out there shooting</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.910" end="01:05:38.100" style="s2">robots and people are put in dual use</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.910" end="01:05:40.830" style="s2">scenarios to them producers robots and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.100" end="01:05:42.510" style="s2">AI is probably stupid right now so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.830" end="01:05:42.900" style="s2">put humans to control and pilot those</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.510" end="01:05:46.319" style="s2">robot</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.900" end="01:05:47.910" style="s2">so even if this slips what I&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.319" end="01:05:51.450" style="s2">I&#39;ve created a mechanism that allows for</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.910" end="01:05:52.920" style="s2">public employment to offset this now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.450" end="01:05:54.660" style="s2">sure there&#39;s a libertarian somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.920" end="01:05:55.829" style="s2">screaming bloody murder at this whole</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.660" end="01:05:57.809" style="s2">concept yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.829" end="01:06:01.740" style="s2">sure that&#39;s true broken window fallacy</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.809" end="01:06:03.750" style="s2">of course that&#39;s all very true but this</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.740" end="01:06:05.760" style="s2">is coming whether you like it or not</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.750" end="01:06:07.710" style="s2">there&#39;s no economic tone that you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.760" end="01:06:09.690" style="s2">point to and say but this book is gonna</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.710" end="01:06:11.520" style="s2">stop the road that&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.690" end="01:06:13.470" style="s2">the robots are here the technology&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.520" end="01:06:15.240" style="s2">here how are you gonna play jujitsu in</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.470" end="01:06:16.619" style="s2">this dojo you can&#39;t you can&#39;t just go</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.240" end="01:06:18.599" style="s2">off the mat you gotta roll with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.619" end="01:06:20.339" style="s2">punches here it doesn&#39;t happen that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.599" end="01:06:22.200" style="s2">not proposing permanent public</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.339" end="01:06:25.470" style="s2">employment it&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.200" end="01:06:27.150" style="s2">saying transitional yeah that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.470" end="01:06:28.289" style="s2">I can offer at this point that&#39;s cuz</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.150" end="01:06:30.420" style="s2">other than that then it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.289" end="01:06:34.049" style="s2">everyone&#39;s paranoid so let&#39;s look at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.420" end="01:06:36.210" style="s2">three points here that that why this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.049" end="01:06:40.700" style="s2">feasible and why this would even be</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.210" end="01:06:45.059" style="s2">sought after this whole you know spiel</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.700" end="01:06:46.799" style="s2">because of dual-use the public&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.059" end="01:06:49.890" style="s2">press the private sector can absorb a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.799" end="01:06:51.539" style="s2">lot of R&amp;D costs and once you get to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.890" end="01:06:53.460" style="s2">warfare scenario where the robots are</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.539" end="01:06:56.520" style="s2">fighting each other that drives costs</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.460" end="01:06:58.289" style="s2">down further as the employment goes up</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.520" end="01:06:59.490" style="s2">because you need more robots for</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.289" end="01:07:00.750" style="s2">everywhere about this destroyer but you</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.490" end="01:07:02.700" style="s2">need the robotic infrastructure you need</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.750" end="01:07:04.589" style="s2">communication you need manufacturing</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.700" end="01:07:06.569" style="s2">production you need allocation the trade</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.589" end="01:07:11.099" style="s2">stable trade between every player in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.569" end="01:07:13.619" style="s2">game so as we pursue this road as long</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.099" end="01:07:15.839" style="s2">as we&#39;re not expending human capital</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.619" end="01:07:19.020" style="s2">like we were on World War 2 in the steel</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.839" end="01:07:22.619" style="s2">cycle in the robot cycle it&#39;s feasible</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.020" end="01:07:24.990" style="s2">to get the cost of robots down very far</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.619" end="01:07:27.000" style="s2">and without a permanent reliance on</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.990" end="01:07:29.130" style="s2">human misery and human expenditure to</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.000" end="01:07:31.859" style="s2">keep those costs low like we do need</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.130" end="01:07:33.539" style="s2">with steel it&#39;s probably pissed off the</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.859" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">Malthusian something awful but go pound</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.539" end="01:07:38.430" style="s2">sand once you get to the point where all</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:39.930" style="s2">of these nations have these robotic</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.430" end="01:07:41.640" style="s2">armies and they&#39;re doing their</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.930" end="01:07:43.260" style="s2">geopolitical dance with each other a</p>

<p begin="01:07:43.260" end="01:07:48.299" style="s2">a Pareto frontier meaning there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.450" end="01:07:50.369" style="s2">to be only so many more configurations</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.299" end="01:07:53.579" style="s2">of robotic conflict until no more</p>

<p begin="01:07:55.200" end="01:07:59.940" style="s2">that and that&#39;s called a Pareto</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.790" end="01:08:02.220" style="s2">dear once you hit that space you will</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.940" end="01:08:04.110" style="s2">have very high employment for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.220" end="01:08:07.920" style="s2">that&#39;s part of a public employment at</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.110" end="01:08:09.540" style="s2">least and that then tips into a swords</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.920" end="01:08:11.850" style="s2">to plowshares scenario now why is that</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.540" end="01:08:15.660" style="s2">because the entire economies of all</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.850" end="01:08:18.120" style="s2">these nations will be modernised in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.660" end="01:08:19.890" style="s2">in the robotic sense at least they will</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.120" end="01:08:22.049" style="s2">have a surplus of robotic forces that</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.890" end="01:08:23.640" style="s2">are not - remember these are dual use so</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.049" end="01:08:25.410" style="s2">not only are they starting as soldiers</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.640" end="01:08:27.089" style="s2">but they can be double back as workers</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.410" end="01:08:29.069" style="s2">they can be brought back as a labour</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.089" end="01:08:30.750" style="s2">facility which of course is gonna drive</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.069" end="01:08:33.359" style="s2">this private unemployment down and we</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.750" end="01:08:35.280" style="s2">know that right but why do we want that</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.359" end="01:08:36.920" style="s2">that sounds like okay I&#39;ve explained all</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.280" end="01:08:39.540" style="s2">this stuff but why do we want that right</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.920" end="01:08:43.799" style="s2">because when you have an abundance of</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.540" end="01:08:46.950" style="s2">workers the cost of work the cost of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.799" end="01:08:49.560" style="s2">labour drops dramatically like extremely</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.950" end="01:08:51.780" style="s2">so now things that were previously too</p>

<p begin="01:09:13.170" end="01:09:17.190" style="s2">the whole game changes the whole</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.569" end="01:09:18.990" style="s2">changes because now you can take the</p>

<p begin="01:09:18.990" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">growth and or at least financial</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.049" end="01:09:27.150" style="s2">capitalism has the premise of infinite</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:29.850" style="s2">growth and we can actually I think I</p>

<p begin="01:10:30.000" end="01:10:34.070" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be hard for them to put all</p>

<p begin="01:10:54.960" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">putting the chat box want me to read on</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.790" end="01:11:01.880" style="s2">your behalf let me know this will go on</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:05.880" style="s2">youtube so don&#39;t be an idiot</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.880" end="01:11:07.950" style="s2">first question pat for me so I know</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.880" end="01:11:11.610" style="s2">you&#39;re plugged into the kind of game be</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.950" end="01:11:14.070" style="s2">space and I had some conversations with</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.610" end="01:11:18.120" style="s2">the sense-making mentions matches about</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.070" end="01:11:19.800" style="s2">this kind of like stuff you having like</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.120" end="01:11:21.750" style="s2">criticism that you received that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.800" end="01:11:24.420" style="s2">thought was good or if you had none</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.750" end="01:11:25.950" style="s2">there in that space what is the best</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.420" end="01:11:27.240" style="s2">counter-argument that you heard when you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.950" end="01:11:29.070" style="s2">presented this idea or maybe you could</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.240" end="01:11:31.260" style="s2">play the devil&#39;s advocate to it I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.070" end="01:11:33.540" style="s2">never heard anyone in gaming counter a</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.260" end="01:11:36.630" style="s2">game beat counter this mostly because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.540" end="01:11:38.100" style="s2">mean I&#39;m the only person I&#39;m like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.630" end="01:11:40.170" style="s2">the only person formulators I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.100" end="01:11:41.550" style="s2">currently telling the story about these</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.170" end="01:11:43.880" style="s2">particular actors and change of events</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.550" end="01:11:46.830" style="s2">so obviously they&#39;ve never encountered</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.880" end="01:11:48.870" style="s2">and given some serious thought I suspect</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.830" end="01:11:51.660" style="s2">that they could they would instinctively</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.870" end="01:11:53.400" style="s2">tried to find tiny semantic exceptions</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.660" end="01:11:56.820" style="s2">and try to build a whole counter</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.400" end="01:11:59.670" style="s2">struggle against that maybe I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.820" end="01:12:02.790" style="s2">cute but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s fun but</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.670" end="01:12:04.980" style="s2">it&#39;s when you seriously grok like you</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.790" end="01:12:06.480" style="s2">get down to like the steel cycle once</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.980" end="01:12:09.090" style="s2">you understand the seal side this steel</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.480" end="01:12:11.160" style="s2">cycle then I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s a harder</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.090" end="01:12:13.110" style="s2">game eh so a game be you would have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.160" end="01:12:16.320" style="s2">like critique this creative destruction</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.110" end="01:12:18.030" style="s2">force outside of like flattening the</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.320" end="01:12:18.600" style="s2">curve which it I think it&#39;s going for is</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.030" end="01:12:20.550" style="s2">saying well</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.600" end="01:12:22.620" style="s2">if it&#39;s gonna peak and spike and cause</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.550" end="01:12:24.690" style="s2">damages let&#39;s like extend it over the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.620" end="01:12:27.390" style="s2">duration of time and and maybe we can</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.690" end="01:12:29.190" style="s2">turn that destruction into opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.390" end="01:12:31.650" style="s2">for more and more people as we dampen it</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.190" end="01:12:35.490" style="s2">from populations maybe you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.650" end="01:12:37.980" style="s2">that works a sort of fractal dampener of</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.490" end="01:12:40.140" style="s2">the of the destruction of one of those</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.980" end="01:12:41.850" style="s2">steel cycles of course that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.140" end="01:12:43.470" style="s2">feasible and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s entire</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.850" end="01:12:47.630" style="s2">bodies of economics that come back that</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.470" end="01:12:56.580" style="s2">type of reasoning but game a plays hard</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.630" end="01:12:57.930" style="s2">they play super hard so you gotta</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.580" end="01:12:59.490" style="s2">realize you&#39;re up against Psychopaths</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.930" end="01:13:00.780" style="s2">and then when you throw the these</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.490" end="01:13:02.280" style="s2">organized ones when you throw the the</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.780" end="01:13:04.680" style="s2">black now inflation on top of it now</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.280" end="01:13:07.080" style="s2">yeah disorganized Psychopaths</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.680" end="01:13:09.900" style="s2">so that gets really weird in fact so I</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.080" end="01:13:12.890" style="s2">think I think with game B I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.900" end="01:13:15.330" style="s2">target the spirit of what I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.890" end="01:13:18.120" style="s2">they&#39;re angling towards which is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.330" end="01:13:20.570" style="s2">gonna save all that for next week which</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.120" end="01:13:22.320" style="s2">is gonna be game B&#39;s approach</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.570" end="01:13:25.380" style="s2">interesting interesting that was gonna</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.320" end="01:13:27.330" style="s2">be my next question is what is your</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.380" end="01:13:29.250" style="s2">critique on game because I think in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.330" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">black male inflation one you said that</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.250" end="01:13:33.330" style="s2">if game B doesn&#39;t work we got to do this</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:34.800" style="s2">robotic nationalism type thing so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.330" end="01:13:38.130" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s next week we should say</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.800" end="01:13:40.590" style="s2">that okay all right so let&#39;s pivot to</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.130" end="01:13:42.750" style="s2">the questions Charles you had a good</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.590" end="01:13:45.410" style="s2">question just oh yeah I gotta let people</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.750" end="01:13:45.410" style="s2">unmute themselves</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.610" end="01:13:50.310" style="s2">go ahead Charles hey Pat thanks for the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.830" end="01:13:53.460" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.310" end="01:13:55.170" style="s2">my question was this is my first time</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.460" end="01:13:58.650" style="s2">listening to you and you&#39;re clearly a</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.170" end="01:13:59.330" style="s2">very independent thinker and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.650" end="01:14:01.800" style="s2">impressive</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.330" end="01:14:06.210" style="s2">just walk us through briefly how you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.800" end="01:14:09.270" style="s2">form your world views yeah I&#39;m a next</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.210" end="01:14:11.100" style="s2">Marxist it&#39;s probably too much shock for</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.270" end="01:14:15.030" style="s2">people if you&#39;re really listening to the</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.100" end="01:14:18.810" style="s2">language I&#39;m using I was a the autistic</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.030" end="01:14:20.460" style="s2">Marxist not the I I hate my parents and</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.810" end="01:14:22.520" style="s2">I went over through the rich Marxist I</p>

<p begin="01:16:10.080" end="01:16:14.220" style="s2">it&#39;s really like 1 percent so there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:16:15.660" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not that big of a deal that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:16:29.430" end="01:16:33.060" style="s2">but there&#39;s all kinds of cool techniques</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.440" end="01:16:36.330" style="s2">that if you really were concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.060" end="01:16:38.280" style="s2">establishing an eco balance these robots</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.330" end="01:16:40.860" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be made a row of a metal</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.280" end="01:16:42.060" style="s2">don&#39;t just throw that expectation out</p>

<p begin="01:16:48.309" end="01:16:52.210" style="s2">i can have robots this big doing it I</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.320" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">don&#39;t need these massive monsters from</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.210" end="01:16:57.219" style="s2">the Industrial Age too you know conduct</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:58.900" style="s2">my violent will here so hemp robotics</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.219" end="01:17:01.479" style="s2">right exactly right I don&#39;t I can make</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.900" end="01:17:03.670" style="s2">it I&#39;ve seen technology where you can</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.479" end="01:17:05.639" style="s2">make circuit boards out of bamboo it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.670" end="01:17:08.170" style="s2">not that hard guys you don&#39;t have to use</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.639" end="01:17:10.570" style="s2">what China is selling to to make these</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.170" end="01:17:11.889" style="s2">these lethal robots it&#39;s not that tough</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.570" end="01:17:14.920" style="s2">so in terms of art you can have</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.889" end="01:17:16.329" style="s2">eco-friendly zero imprint robot war if</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.920" end="01:17:18.570" style="s2">that&#39;s a thing that needs to be marketed</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.329" end="01:17:21.369" style="s2">I mean which it sounds like it might be</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.570" end="01:17:27.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s within the realm of</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.369" end="01:17:28.840" style="s2">feasibility for sure cool kocchi you</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.340" end="01:17:40.239" style="s2">have a question if you can unmute</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.840" end="01:17:42.489" style="s2">yourself mr. Keshe yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.239" end="01:17:46.059" style="s2">just wondering like what makes you think</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.489" end="01:17:47.829" style="s2">the the robots are going to be expensive</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.059" end="01:17:49.719" style="s2">in job-creating when they get destroyed</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.829" end="01:17:53.139" style="s2">versus just like attaching a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.719" end="01:17:56.170" style="s2">explosives to quadrotor drone mm-hmm yes</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.139" end="01:17:59.079" style="s2">so one robot it&#39;s not as simple as press</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.170" end="01:18:01.590" style="s2">button get robot you need to pay the</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.079" end="01:18:04.210" style="s2">licensing for the software you need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.590" end="01:18:06.099" style="s2">put up the factory that can make it</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.210" end="01:18:10.360" style="s2">whether it&#39;s a small factory or a large</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.099" end="01:18:11.559" style="s2">factory you need to constantly maintain</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.360" end="01:18:13.599" style="s2">it and prove it and there&#39;s a service</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.559" end="01:18:15.610" style="s2">required for that you need to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.599" end="01:18:18.369" style="s2">that the lenses and the servos and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.610" end="01:18:20.979" style="s2">motors are manufactured as well you need</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.369" end="01:18:22.510" style="s2">to keep quality control and swarm</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.979" end="01:18:23.710" style="s2">management it&#39;s not just gonna be one</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.510" end="01:18:25.300" style="s2">person for a robot you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.710" end="01:18:27.639" style="s2">looking at one person controlling 100</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.300" end="01:18:29.469" style="s2">robots with a bunch of intermediary good</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.639" end="01:18:32.800" style="s2">enough AIS to assist in the person</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.469" end="01:18:34.449" style="s2">managing those fleets there is a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.800" end="01:18:36.010" style="s2">aggregate economics that can be</p>

<p begin="01:18:36.940" end="01:18:41.170" style="s2">so whenever a robot goes down through</p>

<p begin="01:20:53.510" end="01:20:58.659" style="s2">i need your protection so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.579" end="01:20:58.659" style="s2">an adaptation as well</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.890" end="01:21:05.980" style="s2">there it&#39;s a Rachel haywire just dropped</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.890" end="01:21:10.360" style="s2">interesting question Rachel can I meet</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.980" end="01:21:12.640" style="s2">yourself hi yeah I&#39;m nationalism</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.360" end="01:21:15.760" style="s2">interesting interesting I&#39;m curious on</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.640" end="01:21:23.130" style="s2">where would robot dictators fall into</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.760" end="01:21:25.030" style="s2">this equation from the media</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.130" end="01:21:26.850" style="s2">possibilities first it would come from</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.030" end="01:21:29.200" style="s2">the media place so you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.850" end="01:21:32.830" style="s2">populist dictators in this space will</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.200" end="01:21:34.870" style="s2">most likely arise from VR that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.830" end="01:21:36.790" style="s2">weird but I believe that question I</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.870" end="01:21:41.050" style="s2">believe a question was asked last week</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.790" end="01:21:43.000" style="s2">about the impact of VR yeah that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.050" end="01:21:45.160" style="s2">so the same reasoning applies there</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.000" end="01:21:48.180" style="s2">usually when you look or I should say</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.160" end="01:21:50.980" style="s2">when you look at the evolution of modern</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.180" end="01:21:56.110" style="s2">communication technologies with every</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.980" end="01:21:58.720" style="s2">advancement of communication tech you</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.110" end="01:22:01.930" style="s2">get a corresponding dictator who got to</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.720" end="01:22:05.110" style="s2">that position by exploiting the advent</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.930" end="01:22:07.360" style="s2">of radio that comes with things like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.110" end="01:22:11.010" style="s2">gonna say FDR as dictator but what I</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.360" end="01:22:11.010" style="s2">mean is it&#39;s just central core of power</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.220" end="01:22:16.510" style="s2">Vladimir Lenin heavily used radio a film</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.920" end="01:22:20.200" style="s2">was heavily used by the Germans in World</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.510" end="01:22:24.610" style="s2">War one under under Casa villa film in</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.200" end="01:22:26.680" style="s2">TV Adolf Hitler was notorious in using</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.610" end="01:22:28.120" style="s2">audio techniques in fact the idea of my</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.680" end="01:22:30.010" style="s2">lower back tape was invented by the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.120" end="01:22:31.780" style="s2">Nazis and what they would do is they</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.010" end="01:22:32.440" style="s2">would record Adolf Hitler on this really</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.780" end="01:22:33.880" style="s2">high-quality</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.440" end="01:22:35.410" style="s2">mile/hour tape and then they&#39;d ship the</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.880" end="01:22:37.150" style="s2">tape everywhere and then they play</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.410" end="01:22:39.250" style="s2">speeches of him from different parts of</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.150" end="01:22:41.320" style="s2">Germany so the Allies would bomb these</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.250" end="01:22:43.510" style="s2">places thinking Hitler was there but he</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.320" end="01:22:45.490" style="s2">was never there because the rest of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.510" end="01:22:47.590" style="s2">world only had access to vinyl and final</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.490" end="01:22:49.450" style="s2">was a quality sound so the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.590" end="01:22:51.250" style="s2">this high-resolution quality sound</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.450" end="01:22:53.590" style="s2">playing from somewhere else obviously he</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.250" end="01:22:58.150" style="s2">was in front of the microphone so so</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.590" end="01:23:00.730" style="s2">media revolutions tend to bridge the gap</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.150" end="01:23:02.680" style="s2">between the will of central state and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.730" end="01:23:04.270" style="s2">how you normalize that to the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.680" end="01:23:05.950" style="s2">the masses and so only mass</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.270" end="01:23:07.510" style="s2">communication can do that so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.950" end="01:23:09.730" style="s2">asking what the dictators will look like</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.510" end="01:23:11.740" style="s2">they won&#39;t be necessarily robotic per se</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.730" end="01:23:13.689" style="s2">but they will be part of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.740" end="01:23:15.340" style="s2">communication regime of those world</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.689" end="01:23:23.939" style="s2">robotic economies and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.340" end="01:23:27.849" style="s2">going to be VR exciting Thank You Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.939" end="01:23:31.179" style="s2">did you fall question rich alert I just</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.849" end="01:23:32.709" style="s2">wanna give our simulation of like a very</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.179" end="01:23:36.429" style="s2">bad dictator you know you kind of</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.709" end="01:23:39.789" style="s2">goggles like robot army is like merging</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.429" end="01:23:41.260" style="s2">robots and you know like engaging those</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.789" end="01:23:42.729" style="s2">experiences because they want to imagine</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.260" end="01:23:43.659" style="s2">it&#39;s like even if we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.729" end="01:23:45.849" style="s2">maybe that would just be like an</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.659" end="01:23:47.650" style="s2">artistic experience or send me to have</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.849" end="01:23:48.999" style="s2">you noted like phones and goggles and</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.650" end="01:23:51.699" style="s2">like we&#39;re about dictators you know I</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.999" end="01:23:54.159" style="s2">mean there&#39;s yeah could be could be</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.699" end="01:23:56.530" style="s2">Ender&#39;s Game as well</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.159" end="01:24:00.760" style="s2">Rachel&#39;s into some kinky that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.530" end="01:24:02.469" style="s2">we that&#39;s why we love her um Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.760" end="01:24:04.769" style="s2">you&#39;re up next did you gonna meet</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.469" end="01:24:04.769" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.800" end="01:24:10.329" style="s2">sure thing do you hear me alright so I</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.099" end="01:24:12.340" style="s2">was just wondering what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.329" end="01:24:14.110" style="s2">sustainability of this system looks like</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.340" end="01:24:16.119" style="s2">you called it West Valley at 3.0 and</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.110" end="01:24:17.800" style="s2">we&#39;re living you know in West Valley a</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.119" end="01:24:19.630" style="s2">2.0 right now with the system of</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.800" end="01:24:21.760" style="s2">reciprocal blackmail sort of keeping</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.630" end="01:24:23.139" style="s2">everyone in check but you know in light</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.760" end="01:24:25.630" style="s2">of advancements that&#39;s going to fall</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.139" end="01:24:28.630" style="s2">apart like you said last week so what do</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.630" end="01:24:31.959" style="s2">you see as a system that would come to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.630" end="01:24:33.969" style="s2">replace this or how do you if that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.959" end="01:24:35.289" style="s2">something you can answer right now how</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.969" end="01:24:38.320" style="s2">do you see this sort of playing out over</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.289" end="01:24:40.389" style="s2">time yeah so I think the thing about</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.320" end="01:24:41.919" style="s2">these westphalia systems is that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.389" end="01:24:43.689" style="s2">should probably stop calling them</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.919" end="01:24:47.229" style="s2">systems and we should probably start</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.689" end="01:24:51.929" style="s2">calling them stints like little wedges</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.229" end="01:24:54.400" style="s2">of transformation for that time where</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.929" end="01:24:56.110" style="s2">this particular arrangement of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.400" end="01:24:59.019" style="s2">how we&#39;re going to keep our psychopaths</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.110" end="01:25:00.369" style="s2">in check then that fell apart and we got</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.019" end="01:25:01.570" style="s2">to keep them in check here&#39;s how we keep</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.369" end="01:25:04.989" style="s2">them in check and that&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.570" end="01:25:06.820" style="s2">just going to change as time goes on so</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.989" end="01:25:10.119" style="s2">even what I&#39;m proposing here is still</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.820" end="01:25:12.789" style="s2">transitionary excuse me it&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.119" end="01:25:14.289" style="s2">the last transition as much as I would</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.789" end="01:25:15.659" style="s2">like it to be one I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.289" end="01:25:18.010" style="s2">true but I would like it to be one</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.659" end="01:25:20.409" style="s2">because once you have an abundance of</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.010" end="01:25:22.599" style="s2">robotic labor available now Astro</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.409" end="01:25:24.789" style="s2">economics is on the table and at that</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.599" end="01:25:27.600" style="s2">point instead of voting with you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.789" end="01:25:29.340" style="s2">your ballot or your BOTS you</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.600" end="01:25:31.620" style="s2">with your feet and you just</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.340" end="01:25:33.570" style="s2">leave like not we&#39;re done here like oh</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.620" end="01:25:34.650" style="s2">you have kings and you have nukes I want</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.570" end="01:25:36.810" style="s2">off this crazy train</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.650" end="01:25:38.790" style="s2">I&#39;d rather go die on a poorly oxygenated</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.810" end="01:25:42.030" style="s2">Rock than spend one more second next to</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.790" end="01:25:45.780" style="s2">these assholes so you need to make the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.030" end="01:25:47.730" style="s2">economics trend towards that mostly</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.780" end="01:25:50.190" style="s2">against the will of economics which is</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.730" end="01:25:52.530" style="s2">why I&#39;m looking at this in a transitory</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.190" end="01:25:54.480" style="s2">phase itself because once you get Astro</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.530" end="01:25:58.110" style="s2">economics and the whole the whole pie</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.480" end="01:25:59.940" style="s2">changes everything changes whether you</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.110" end="01:26:01.470" style="s2">have a Westphalia system in that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.940" end="01:26:04.230" style="s2">think you will I think you&#39;ll have more</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.470" end="01:26:05.700" style="s2">of a replay of the Stone Age where when</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.230" end="01:26:09.710" style="s2">people disagreed with one another they</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.700" end="01:26:09.710" style="s2">just ran across the horizon basically</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.550" end="01:26:18.830" style="s2">cool so my favorite poetry buddy key has</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.180" end="01:26:21.600" style="s2">a question key could you onion self</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.830" end="01:26:25.580" style="s2">again I&#39;m not I&#39;m totally not it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.600" end="01:26:28.740" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s great it&#39;s thank you uh-huh a</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.580" end="01:26:30.390" style="s2">lot for the time that&#39;s the first thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.740" end="01:26:33.090" style="s2">that someone said here and I appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.390" end="01:26:36.240" style="s2">that um question is could you clarify</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.090" end="01:26:38.670" style="s2">the idea that banking is ideal for space</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.240" end="01:26:41.330" style="s2">economics you mentioned someone Daniel</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.670" end="01:26:45.900" style="s2">Suarez just just wanted to understand it</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.330" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">yeah the goal of financial banking is to</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.900" end="01:26:50.070" style="s2">pay off the interest that&#39;s the entire</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:52.410" style="s2">purpose of financial banking it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.070" end="01:26:54.690" style="s2">is no other rule everything else is</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.410" end="01:26:57.210" style="s2">organically derived as a result of that</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.690" end="01:26:59.760" style="s2">rule so to understand what interest</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.210" end="01:27:01.590" style="s2">means if I produce ten Pat bucks like</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.760" end="01:27:03.840" style="s2">here&#39;s ten Pat bucks I just pop them</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.590" end="01:27:07.020" style="s2">into existence and then I give them to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.840" end="01:27:10.380" style="s2">you and I say hey you owe me twelve Pat</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.020" end="01:27:12.120" style="s2">bucks you might say okay that&#39;s fine but</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.380" end="01:27:14.400" style="s2">there&#39;s only ten Pat bucks in</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.120" end="01:27:16.470" style="s2">circulation where are you going to get</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.400" end="01:27:18.240" style="s2">the other two from well the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.470" end="01:27:20.820" style="s2">you can&#39;t so obviously it&#39;s a game you</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.240" end="01:27:22.290" style="s2">lose so now you owe me that money</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.820" end="01:27:24.420" style="s2">because you signed a piece of paper and</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.290" end="01:27:26.010" style="s2">I just got more goons than you so now</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.420" end="01:27:27.930" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna pay me those two Pat bucks</p>

<p begin="01:36:10.240" end="01:36:16.719" style="s2">means you do end up in this type of like</p>

<p begin="01:37:05.079" end="01:37:09.999" style="s2">say also on the timing things end up</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.449" end="01:37:14.110" style="s2">taking longer than you expect do you</p>
<p begin="01:37:09.999" end="01:37:17.440" style="s2">ever I don&#39;t know how to ask this what</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.110" end="01:37:20.380" style="s2">if the entire kind of jobs capitalism</p>
<p begin="01:37:17.440" end="01:37:22.389" style="s2">based system morphs into a ubi blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.380" end="01:37:23.229" style="s2">blah type system how do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.389" end="01:37:25.539" style="s2">also works</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.229" end="01:37:28.900" style="s2">what&#39;s your model there you&#39;ll be able</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.539" end="01:37:30.940" style="s2">to see rationale for ubi and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:37:28.900" end="01:37:33.280" style="s2">proposing by saying well we have robot</p>
<p begin="01:37:30.940" end="01:37:35.139" style="s2">slaves so let them do all the work and</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.280" end="01:37:36.550" style="s2">then we&#39;ll just profit from it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.139" end="01:37:37.929" style="s2">gonna be very politically tempting</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.550" end="01:37:39.909" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna see a lot of people running</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.929" end="01:37:41.019" style="s2">on that it&#39;s going to be almost boring</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.909" end="01:37:43.960" style="s2">the amount of people that will run on</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.019" end="01:37:46.570" style="s2">that and they&#39;ll be able to make it</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.960" end="01:37:48.099" style="s2">happen to a degree what that does to</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.570" end="01:37:49.719" style="s2">human psyche well we know what that does</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.099" end="01:37:52.210" style="s2">of human psyche because the Romans had</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.719" end="01:37:53.679" style="s2">access to slaves and they had a Roman</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.210" end="01:37:55.210" style="s2">citizens in the city proper had the</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.679" end="01:37:57.369" style="s2">equivalent of ubi they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.210" end="01:37:58.570" style="s2">pay taxes they had free grain and all</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.369" end="01:37:59.889" style="s2">this stuff that were available to them</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.570" end="01:38:04.479" style="s2">and they just spent all day each</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.889" end="01:38:05.710" style="s2">other so so it&#39;s it&#39;s like this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.479" end="01:38:08.469" style="s2">the first time we&#39;ve done this type of</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.710" end="01:38:10.269" style="s2">thing if you want to see what ubi really</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.469" end="01:38:12.670" style="s2">looks like go to Saudi Arabia good lord</p>

<p begin="01:38:37.900" end="01:38:41.020" style="s2">there are models we can pull from and at</p>

<p begin="01:38:41.020" end="01:38:47.680" style="s2">pull from those models to understand how</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.610" end="01:38:50.110" style="s2">to how to manage those a bit better cool</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.680" end="01:38:52.630" style="s2">ok I&#39;m going to read this question the</p>

<p begin="01:40:22.510" end="01:40:31.060" style="s2">the cheap hack is to basically have IOT</p>

<p begin="01:41:48.040" end="01:41:53.520" style="s2">important but biological life seems to</p>

<p begin="01:42:08.350" end="01:42:14.590" style="s2">inventing computing we think AI is going</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.080" end="01:42:17.040" style="s2">to be the end-all be-all because it get</p>

<p begin="01:42:17.040" end="01:42:22.620" style="s2">language or vision and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:42:19.719" end="01:42:24.880" style="s2">hard yeah so it seems that biologic or</p>
<p begin="01:42:22.620" end="01:42:27.820" style="s2">synthetic life goes the other direction</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.880" end="01:42:29.170" style="s2">its propositional it&#39;s its base and then</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.820" end="01:42:31.810" style="s2">it goes the other direction with</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.170" end="01:42:34.650" style="s2">participatory being its final stage so</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.810" end="01:42:38.020" style="s2">there&#39;s something like a flipping of the</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.650" end="01:42:40.600" style="s2">motivation which is kind of the Lorenz</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.020" end="01:42:42.550" style="s2">attractor kind of lobe switch between</p>

<p begin="01:42:44.530" end="01:42:49.320" style="s2">that kind of balances where we are that</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.320" end="01:42:52.780" style="s2">creates kind of an ever-increasing</p>

<p begin="01:42:52.780" end="01:42:57.909" style="s2">hierarchies so is there something like</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.910" end="01:43:01.719" style="s2">that that is continuing to grow us</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.909" end="01:43:04.690" style="s2">with balancing the the AI so AI</p>

<p begin="01:43:07.179" end="01:43:11.889" style="s2">end state yes yes that is that is a</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.239" end="01:43:14.650" style="s2">pretty good visual Lorenz attractor</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.889" end="01:43:16.090" style="s2">stuff is applicable in this sense which</p>

<p begin="01:44:05.170" end="01:44:08.770" style="s2">up on that fight entirely and I said</p>

<p begin="01:44:08.770" end="01:44:13.000" style="s2">can&#39;t use human brains obviously so I</p>

<p begin="01:44:13.000" end="01:44:18.280" style="s2">here&#39;s the here&#39;s a thought this is kind</p>

<p begin="01:44:25.630" end="01:44:30.790" style="s2">because it goes exponential and we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.159" end="01:44:34.420" style="s2">do that my thought was oh you&#39;re under</p>

<p begin="01:47:41.260" end="01:47:48.560" style="s2">intelligence or life comes at it from</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.650" end="01:47:50.659" style="s2">all angles so this consciousness thing I</p>

<p begin="01:47:52.239" end="01:47:58.070" style="s2">it&#39;s already there so this is something</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.489" end="01:47:59.690" style="s2">like and this is where I come back to</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.070" end="01:48:02.120" style="s2">Donnell Hoffman in the notion of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.690" end="01:48:04.880" style="s2">case against reality something is</p>
<p begin="01:48:02.120" end="01:48:06.770" style="s2">already happening where life the</p>
<p begin="01:48:04.880" end="01:48:09.080" style="s2">universe is living and just doing ever</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.770" end="01:48:12.020" style="s2">more complex ways of perceiving itself</p>
<p begin="01:48:09.080" end="01:48:14.150" style="s2">so the thought that we invented</p>
<p begin="01:48:12.020" end="01:48:17.870" style="s2">something it&#39;s really we&#39;re being used</p>
<p begin="01:48:14.150" end="01:48:19.670" style="s2">yeah to deepen a perspective not to not</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.870" end="01:48:22.699" style="s2">to infinity perspective there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.670" end="01:48:25.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a raging debate in academia</p>
<p begin="01:48:22.699" end="01:48:27.770" style="s2">about is mathematics invented or is it</p>
<p begin="01:48:25.190" end="01:48:29.630" style="s2">discovered and that hits the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:48:27.770" end="01:48:31.280" style="s2">what it is you&#39;re talking about and that</p>
<p begin="01:48:29.630" end="01:48:32.719" style="s2">you can actually filter in personality</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.280" end="01:48:35.030" style="s2">pretty quickly from that and be like if</p>
<p begin="01:48:32.719" end="01:48:36.469" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s discovered then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.030" end="01:48:37.730" style="s2">probably talking to an engineer and if</p>
<p begin="01:48:36.469" end="01:48:40.520" style="s2">it&#39;s vented you&#39;re probably talking to a</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.730" end="01:48:41.900" style="s2">philosopher so it&#39;s it&#39;s a fun little or</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.520" end="01:48:44.989" style="s2">a theologian so it&#39;s a fun little game</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.900" end="01:48:47.060" style="s2">but that&#39;s another way of sort of</p>
<p begin="01:48:44.989" end="01:48:49.040" style="s2">mathematically teasing out what I think</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.060" end="01:48:50.600" style="s2">you&#39;re circling and I think next week</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.040" end="01:48:53.270" style="s2">I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll be covering Auto cults</p>
<p begin="01:48:50.600" end="01:48:54.590" style="s2">which will be tapping into the periphery</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.270" end="01:48:58.969" style="s2">of some of that stuff certainly not the</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.590" end="01:49:01.969" style="s2">core but definitely the periphery cool</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.969" end="01:49:04.130" style="s2">thanks for that David so let&#39;s ask one</p>
<p begin="01:49:01.969" end="01:49:20.920" style="s2">more question and Hannah if you can</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.130" end="01:49:23.510" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask the question I</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.920" end="01:49:25.989" style="s2">would like to volunteer my space to</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.510" end="01:49:25.989" style="s2">someone else</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.600" end="01:49:32.180" style="s2">I can read your question Hannah we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.240" end="01:49:33.950" style="s2">seen human operators at of at distant</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.180" end="01:49:36.110" style="s2">war tech in need of mental health</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.950" end="01:49:38.330" style="s2">support with things like drones but the</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.110" end="01:49:41.060" style="s2">human propensity of anthropomorphize</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.330" end="01:49:44.840" style="s2">ation will the robot soldier operators</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.060" end="01:49:48.320" style="s2">need therapy that i&#39;ve seen i&#39;ve met</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.840" end="01:49:49.160" style="s2">some of those drone pilots some of them</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.320" end="01:49:51.200" style="s2">are hurt by it</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.160" end="01:49:55.580" style="s2">some of them enjoy the fact that their</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.200" end="01:49:59.750" style="s2">god it&#39;s it&#39;s most people can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.580" end="01:50:02.210" style="s2">comprehend like it&#39;s not like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.750" end="01:50:03.620" style="s2">sitting there and disassociating from it</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.210" end="01:50:06.020" style="s2">and saying it&#39;s just pixels on a screen</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.620" end="01:50:07.310" style="s2">no drone operators doing that they know</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.020" end="01:50:08.420" style="s2">damn well that they&#39;re hitting some</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.310" end="01:50:10.070" style="s2">people and that&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.420" end="01:50:12.140" style="s2">consequences and they hope that their</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.070" end="01:50:13.040" style="s2">kill chain did the right analysis</p>
<p begin="01:50:12.140" end="01:50:14.210" style="s2">because there&#39;s they&#39;re pressing the</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.040" end="01:50:16.190" style="s2">buttons throughout they&#39;re making you</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.210" end="01:50:18.980" style="s2">know the call and you know what wedding</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.190" end="01:50:21.860" style="s2">parties target and what gets even worse</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.980" end="01:50:24.820" style="s2">is that sometimes the operators are in</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.860" end="01:50:27.200" style="s2">control and sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.820" end="01:50:28.910" style="s2">experimentation on AI so if you start</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.200" end="01:50:30.560" style="s2">seeing these drones targeting wedding</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.910" end="01:50:34.120" style="s2">parties it&#39;s because those were false</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.560" end="01:50:35.330" style="s2">positives for groups according to the AI</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.120" end="01:50:37.400" style="s2">oops</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.330" end="01:50:38.720" style="s2">you know they put AI in the kill chain</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.400" end="01:50:40.700" style="s2">and it makes mistakes and I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="01:50:38.720" end="01:50:42.710" style="s2">about that but that&#39;s the thing and so</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.700" end="01:50:44.450" style="s2">if that ever gets back down to the</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.710" end="01:50:46.160" style="s2">operator than that guys like what the</p>
<p begin="01:50:44.450" end="01:50:47.300" style="s2"> I didn&#39;t want to do that obviously</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.160" end="01:50:51.290" style="s2">he didn&#39;t want to do that and he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:50:47.300" end="01:50:54.380" style="s2">out there for a genocide or rampage so</p>
<p begin="01:50:51.290" end="01:50:56.810" style="s2">there is huge pressure to at least</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.380" end="01:50:59.180" style="s2">psychological to one keep your operator</p>
<p begin="01:50:56.810" end="01:51:03.110" style="s2">in check but that&#39;s again that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:59.180" end="01:51:04.810" style="s2">targeting humans what does it operate it</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.110" end="01:51:07.700" style="s2">look like when he&#39;s blowing up robots I</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.810" end="01:51:09.320" style="s2">think he cares probably no different</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.700" end="01:51:12.050" style="s2">than shooting you know pixels on the</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.320" end="01:51:13.820" style="s2">screen targeting humans is a big deal</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.050" end="01:51:16.690" style="s2">targeting other robots yeah whatever</p>
<p begin="01:51:13.820" end="01:51:16.690" style="s2">just light it up</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.120" end="01:51:27.290" style="s2">all right on that note Pat you have any</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.400" end="01:51:29.000" style="s2">final thoughts in today&#39;s session my</p>
<p begin="01:51:27.290" end="01:51:31.940" style="s2">analysis relies on a lot of assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:51:29.000" end="01:51:33.890" style="s2">and there is an endless number every</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.940" end="01:51:35.780" style="s2">single you might have seen the political</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.890" end="01:51:37.520" style="s2">compass and every single square and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.780" end="01:51:41.480" style="s2">political compass can tear this to</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.520" end="01:51:43.220" style="s2">shreds there is no doubt about that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.480" end="01:51:45.950" style="s2">not here to make an indefensible on a</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.220" end="01:51:49.490" style="s2">saleable position I&#39;m basically making a</p>
<p begin="01:51:45.950" end="01:51:51.770" style="s2">heuristic guess of when you get</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.490" end="01:51:54.350" style="s2">information technology to the cheap</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.770" end="01:51:56.540" style="s2">state that it&#39;s at and you compare that</p>
<p begin="01:51:54.350" end="01:52:00.530" style="s2">with the demand for increasing cheap</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.540" end="01:52:02.420" style="s2">labor it is not hard to start getting</p>
<p begin="01:52:00.530" end="01:52:05.590" style="s2">these robot soldiers and robot warrior</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.420" end="01:52:08.030" style="s2">robot labor once you have that in play</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.590" end="01:52:10.040" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s gonna be democracy do</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.030" end="01:52:10.790" style="s2">you think it&#39;s gonna be fascism I think</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.040" end="01:52:11.990" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be something you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.790" end="01:52:18.980" style="s2"> seen before</p>
<p begin="01:52:11.990" end="01:52:22.040" style="s2">I&#39;m probably gonna be the latter cool so</p>
