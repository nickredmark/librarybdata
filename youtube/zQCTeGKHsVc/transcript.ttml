<p begin="00:00:15.340" end="00:00:21.149" style="s2">They&#39;ve been dozens of responses to the jordan peterson channel for interview already. What makes this one different?</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.210" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">Well, I have a pretty unique perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.290" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">October last year I went to Toronto to interview Jordan Peterson at his home you came in from where I came in from London</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.719" end="00:00:41.519" style="s2">last night, I turned the interview into the first full-length documentary about Jordan Peterson&#39;s ideas I</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.160" end="00:00:48.509" style="s2">Was pretty sure he&#39;d soon become a lot more famous and be recognized as one of the most significant public thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.510" end="00:00:53.910" style="s2">but I couldn&#39;t possibly have predicted how he&#39;d break through to a mass audience a</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.640" end="00:01:00.630" style="s2">few weeks later Peterson did an interview with journalist Kathy Newman on Channel four News in the UK a</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.600" end="00:01:05.460" style="s2">Program I worked on as a reporter and producer for ten years</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.240" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">It was a sensation</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.400" end="00:01:11.400" style="s2">Millions watched it online</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.500" end="00:01:17.849" style="s2">Tens of thousands commented an overwhelming majority felt Peterson had been unfairly represented</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.430" end="00:01:24.040" style="s2">And in the week since it hasn&#39;t stopped</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.650" end="00:01:29.139" style="s2">Peterson has been asked about it constantly on the most high-profile online shows</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.690" end="00:01:32.410" style="s2">12 rules for life so without reading this</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.960" end="00:01:34.960" style="s2">So what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.350" end="00:01:40.660" style="s2">There&#39;s only 12 things you need to do in life right, that&#39;s it well yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.180" end="00:01:45.760" style="s2">This interview that you just did with this woman Kathy Newman shit was that in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.760" end="00:01:52.300" style="s2">it was Channel 4 UK so what does this glitch say about the state of mainstream media and</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.729" end="00:01:54.729" style="s2">the culture at large</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.009" end="00:02:02.379" style="s2">By diagnosis of what&#39;s actually happening is that people are moving further and further away from?</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.990" end="00:02:08.830" style="s2">what is what thinking actually is I&#39;m at or more into merely running a script and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.739" end="00:02:14.619" style="s2">What does Jordan Peterson actually think that&#39;s so controversial you are?</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.590" end="00:02:17.140" style="s2">misrepresented more than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.140" end="00:02:25.029" style="s2">I know in a weird way. You are villainized in a weird way where I can&#39;t believe that these people are honestly</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.000" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">looking at your opinions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.340" end="00:02:35.229" style="s2">Coming up with these conclusions. I believe this encounter struck such a nerve because it&#39;s a cultural watershed moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.570" end="00:02:42.609" style="s2">But seen properly as Peterson would say it&#39;s archetypal in that it contains layers and layers of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.940" end="00:02:48.639" style="s2">That go right to the heart of the biggest rift. We&#39;re seeing playing out in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.869" style="s2">Over the next 50 minutes. I&#39;m gonna do my best to unpack it</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.480" end="00:02:58.239" style="s2">From the clash between new and old media. There&#39;s also why YouTube is gonna kill TV</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.030" end="00:03:02.619" style="s2">Because television by its nature all of these narrow</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.290" end="00:03:05.239" style="s2">broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.239" end="00:03:11.739" style="s2">technologies they rely on forcing the story all the way down to the mythological an</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.079" end="00:03:15.609" style="s2">Archetypal level I thought of ideologies as fragmentary mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.680" end="00:03:22.660" style="s2">That&#39;s where they get their archetypal and psychological power, but in the postmodern world and this seems to be something that&#39;s increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.180" end="00:03:27.790" style="s2">Seeping out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.790" end="00:03:32.950" style="s2">But the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing, but the benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.700" end="00:03:39.250" style="s2">Benevolent great mother and it&#39;s a it&#39;s an appalling ideology, and it seems to me that it&#39;s sucking the vitality</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.040" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">Which is exactly what you&#39;d expect symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:49.510" style="s2">It&#39;s sucking the vitality of her culture and to ask how do we move forward constructively rather than just adding to the polarization?</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.150" end="00:03:57.640" style="s2">I&#39;ve been a journalist for 16 years in the newsrooms of the BBC in channel 4 and then making documentaries I</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.849" end="00:04:03.399" style="s2">moved away from the frontline of news some time ago and started learning psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:06.880" style="s2">Which is what first drew me to Jordan Peterson?</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.489" end="00:04:13.239" style="s2">from a distance I&#39;ve started to see the blind spots of the establishment media much more clearly I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.060" end="00:04:18.790" style="s2">Spent some of the best years of my working life at Channel 4 News and have a huge amount of respect</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.859" end="00:04:20.859" style="s2">And gratitude to the program</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.350" end="00:04:28.479" style="s2">But I&#39;m making this film because I feel so strongly that if we can&#39;t have open conversations about the kind of topics Peterson is raising</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:30.880" style="s2">We&#39;re in serious trouble</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.310" end="00:04:37.089" style="s2">My book went up to number two and on amazon.com in the US the next day right it&#39;s number one in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.090" end="00:04:39.489" style="s2">it&#39;s number three in the UK all on Amazon I</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.010" end="00:04:46.539" style="s2">Couldn&#39;t have asked for more publicity right and so I could also be sitting back and saying well. You know she tried to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.459" style="s2">My a person who regarded herself as my ideological opponent</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:55.660" style="s2">Tried to go after my philosophy and my reputation on national TV</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.450" end="00:05:00.639" style="s2">Failed brutally and has been taken apart for it. It&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.639" end="00:05:05.288" style="s2">This is a good day, but I don&#39;t regard it as a good day. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good day</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:07.850" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.850" end="00:05:10.119" style="s2">think that it&#39;s evidence of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.240" end="00:05:14.410" style="s2">Instability of the times that we&#39;re in it would have been much better</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.410" end="00:05:19.269" style="s2">For me and for everyone else if what we would have had was a real conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.300" end="00:05:25.660" style="s2">You said that it&#39;s actually a sign of the times where things could go really wrong for all of us really soon</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.030" end="00:05:29.859" style="s2">Yeah, we&#39;re playing with fire. Yeah, what do you mean by this? Can you can you elaborate?</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.070" end="00:05:35.859" style="s2">Well things go wrong in cultures all the time right you get you get the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.650" end="00:05:39.160" style="s2">Increases until people start to act it out</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.580" end="00:05:47.959" style="s2">Peterson is one of a new breed of thinkers made famous almost completely by the internet not the broadcast media</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.480" end="00:05:53.839" style="s2">Part of a powerful new informal network being called the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.180" end="00:05:59.900" style="s2">The mainstream media is based on an old dying model that is being replaced by new media</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.900" end="00:06:04.640" style="s2">And new technology so quickly that its faults are becoming glaringly obvious</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.760" end="00:06:13.670" style="s2">Fortunately, thanks to YouTube podcasting and however else you get shows like this one the mainstream media&#39;s stranglehold on information</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.670" end="00:06:20.629" style="s2">Which really is a stranglehold on your ability to think clearly about the issues of the day is crumbling at an incredible rate?</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:27.980" style="s2">Now the question is who and what will replace it a few months ago one of my favorite people to sit across this table from</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.980" end="00:06:29.980" style="s2">Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.120" end="00:06:36.020" style="s2">Intellectual dark web to describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to his brother Brett</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.090" end="00:06:41.480" style="s2">Weinstein to jordan Peterson all of whom are figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.090" end="00:06:44.570" style="s2">Conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.030" end="00:06:48.140" style="s2">It&#39;s why I would argue that this collection of people are actually more</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.450" end="00:06:52.189" style="s2">influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news pundits you can come up with</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.560" end="00:06:59.720" style="s2">If you think I&#39;m being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this group just check the traction that these people get on Twitter or Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.880" end="00:07:04.850" style="s2">Compared to our mainstream competitors twitter may not be real life as I say in my Twitter bio</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.850" end="00:07:08.450" style="s2">But it is some barometer of what the zeitgeist is right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.640" end="00:07:16.609" style="s2">what unites this group of thinkers is a sense that the set of ideas that have run Western culture for years are breaking down and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.040" end="00:07:20.809" style="s2">That the chaos of the moment is the attempt to find new ones</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.900" end="00:07:26.630" style="s2">It&#39;s nearly all happening online part of the problem that we have right now in our culture is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:30.589" style="s2">Trying to diagnose the level at which the discussion should be taking place</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.590" end="00:07:36.799" style="s2">And I think the reason that this is a tumultuous time is because it actually is a time for discussion of first principles</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:39.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s that first principles are</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.600" end="00:07:46.640" style="s2">Virtually at the level of theology because the first principles are the things that you assume and then move forwards like well</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.640" end="00:07:53.359" style="s2">What should we assume well the dignity of the human soul let&#39;s start with that you can&#39;t treat yourself properly without assuming that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:07:56.910" style="s2">Have a relationship with another person you can&#39;t stabilize your family</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.910" end="00:08:01.229" style="s2">You can&#39;t have a functional society, so what does it mean for this human soul to have dignity?</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.509" end="00:08:02.289" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.289" end="00:08:05.219" style="s2">The part of the idea is that you&#39;re participating in</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.319" end="00:08:08.279" style="s2">Creation itself and you do that with your actions in your language</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.280" end="00:08:13.410" style="s2">And you get to decide whether you&#39;re tilting the world a bit more towards heaven or a bit more towards hell</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.410" end="00:08:20.099" style="s2">And that&#39;s actually what you&#39;re doing so that&#39;s a place where the literal and the metaphorical truth comes together and people are very</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.009" end="00:08:25.469" style="s2">They&#39;re terrified of that idea as they should be because it&#39;s a massive responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.990" end="00:08:29.639" style="s2">They also argue that the central problem is polarization</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.340" end="00:08:32.340" style="s2">boosted by social media</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.589" end="00:08:39.389" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work looks at how people are hard-wired to see the world differently a lot of what determines your political</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:42.240" style="s2">orientation is</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:46.529" style="s2">Biological temperament far more than people realize so for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.770" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">left-leaning people</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:53.940" style="s2">liberals, let&#39;s say although that&#39;s kind of MIS misnomer, but</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:09:00.659" style="s2">We&#39;ll keep with the terminology liberals are high in a trait called openness, which is one of the big five personality traits</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.660" end="00:09:05.160" style="s2">And it&#39;s associated with interest in abstraction and interest in aesthetics</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.620" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">it&#39;s the best predictor of liberal political leaning and they&#39;re low in trait conscientiousness, which is dutifulness and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.839" end="00:09:17.369" style="s2">Orderliness in particular whereas the Conservatives are the opposite?</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.370" end="00:09:18.510" style="s2">They&#39;re high in conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.510" end="00:09:26.219" style="s2">They&#39;re dutiful and orderly and they&#39;re low in openness and that makes them really good managers and administers ministers and often businessman</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.220" end="00:09:28.220" style="s2">But not very good entrepreneurs</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">Because the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn from the liberal types and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.130" end="00:09:35.130" style="s2">These are really fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.410" end="00:09:40.980" style="s2">fundamentally biologically predicated differences, and they&#39;re you might think about them as different sets of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.550" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">Opportunities and limitations, and and certainly different ways of screening the world and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.440" end="00:09:51.599" style="s2">Each of those different temperamental types needs the other type</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.610" end="00:09:59.130" style="s2">Let&#39;s call this a diversity issue if you start understanding that the person that you&#39;re talking to who doesn&#39;t share your political views</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.950" end="00:10:01.950" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.110" end="00:10:08.190" style="s2">Stupid that&#39;s the first thing necessarily. They might be but so might you be no stupid. He isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.009" end="00:10:13.139" style="s2">Differences in intelligence are not the prime determinant of differences in political belief</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.750" end="00:10:14.430" style="s2">All right</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.430" end="00:10:16.709" style="s2">so you might be talking to someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.050" end="00:10:21.089" style="s2">More conscientious and less creative than you if you&#39;re if you happen to be a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.220" end="00:10:24.959" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t mean that that person&#39;s perspective is not valid</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:31.318" style="s2">And it doesn&#39;t mean that they wouldn&#39;t outperform you in some domains because they would so one thing to remember is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.870" end="00:10:37.079" style="s2">People actually do see the world differently. It&#39;s not merely that they that they&#39;re possessed of love</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.829" end="00:10:39.829" style="s2">ilie informed opinions</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.240" end="00:10:42.899" style="s2">the whole point of the dava democracy is to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.420" end="00:10:45.599" style="s2">Continue the dialogue between people of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.120" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">Temperamental types so that we don&#39;t move so far to the right that everything</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.920" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:57.629" style="s2">encapsulated and stone and doesn&#39;t move or so far to the left and everything dissolves in a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.269" end="00:11:47.369" style="s2">The culture were the the 20th century was a decisive</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.670" end="00:11:50.699" style="s2">success for blue any</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.000" end="00:11:54.239" style="s2">effectively a route for red</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.990" end="00:12:01.709" style="s2">So what we see first is that red was forced to move into a deeply exploratory phase</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.149" end="00:12:06.989" style="s2">Second that it did this in a context</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.990" end="00:12:08.740" style="s2">Where as it turns out?</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.740" end="00:12:15.659" style="s2">things were changing meaningfully quite significantly in fact it from my perspective in a world historical level the emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.180" end="00:12:18.180" style="s2">entirely new forms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.939" end="00:12:22.409" style="s2">communication and therefore entirely new sense-making and coherence</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.990" end="00:12:29.039" style="s2">He concludes that the blue church is in the process of collapse as its dominant ideology</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:31.140" style="s2">Can&#39;t adapt to changing reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.900" end="00:12:37.889" style="s2">But that a combination of the two sets of values of blue and red is essential</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.050" end="00:12:40.050" style="s2">we are conscious and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.070" end="00:12:48.179" style="s2">Effective in the world in groups, not as individuals and the ingredients of those groups</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.110" end="00:12:53.430" style="s2">Include aspects that are currently showing up as both red and blue I</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.720" end="00:12:59.820" style="s2">Propose somewhat strongly that</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.930" end="00:13:03.930" style="s2">Neither red nor blue as pure</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.450" end="00:13:08.819" style="s2">Elements contain the ingredients necessary to actually be adaptive to reality</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.850" end="00:13:11.850" style="s2">This is a disaster in fact</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.310" end="00:13:14.310" style="s2">It&#39;s a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:18.070" style="s2">Separating the hand and the eye</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.070" end="00:13:23.489" style="s2">Now you&#39;re the eye can see if the eye takes itself as being the essence of virtue it separates itself from the ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.740" end="00:13:28.620" style="s2">The same thing with the hand for most of human history these groups have actually always commingled</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.620" end="00:13:33.840" style="s2">They&#39;re necessary that they actually relate to each other in a deeply healthy and direct fashion</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.300" end="00:13:36.960" style="s2">their separations into armed camps is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.350" end="00:13:44.910" style="s2">Extinction area actually you know the values of red that you think blue needs to integrate you also may also reintegrate. Oh well</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.910" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">That&#39;s actually pretty easy</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:48.750" style="s2">Responsibility I mean we&#39;ve actually even seen it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.740" end="00:13:52.740" style="s2">The ability to</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.230" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">Make a commitment and keep it</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.340" end="00:14:03.539" style="s2">Which which by the way ideologically shows up is either duty or loyalty, but those are both ideologies the the deeper sense is that ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.520" end="00:14:10.859" style="s2">Responsibility both of the individual in the group level the ability to actually really make a</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.260" end="00:14:16.080" style="s2">Personal sacrifice on the part of the group that&#39;s actually a deeply</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.600" end="00:14:18.600" style="s2">read value</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.910" end="00:14:20.910" style="s2">and I don&#39;t mean that by the way as</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.300" end="00:14:25.229" style="s2">Politically ideological certainly there are people who?</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">Are currently part of blue who feel that deeply what I&#39;m saying is that that shows up much much more intensely in</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.660" end="00:14:39.390" style="s2">Read and when you&#39;re feeling it in blue. You&#39;re actually feeling a red value, and that&#39;s good mixing is crucial</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.040" end="00:14:44.400" style="s2">Because that&#39;s very Jordan Peterson esque -</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.100" end="00:14:47.520" style="s2">How would you how do you define Jordan Peterson?</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.520" end="00:14:52.649" style="s2">Or do you think the fact the issue is that he is is not definable within one of those two camps</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:53.790" style="s2">Yeah, I think that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.790" end="00:15:00.210" style="s2">I think that he grasps directly the fact that human beings can only actually make sense of the world by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.510" end="00:15:08.279" style="s2">communication with other human beings and this is all about the notion of admixture that one must have a mixture of of</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.950" end="00:15:13.499" style="s2">What I mean he uses the mythopoetic to make sense the order order and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.260" end="00:15:20.489" style="s2">The way right the taoist way is the alchemical admixture of order and chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.130" end="00:15:26.219" style="s2">And that&#39;s it like that&#39;s how you do it, and so if you bias towards orderliness</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.830" end="00:15:30.689" style="s2">You find yourself in a rigid non adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.960" end="00:15:34.349" style="s2">non creative non exploratory framework</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:39.480" style="s2">Which will die because the world changes if you bias towards chaos</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:42.779" style="s2">You you eat your young and evaporate</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.420" end="00:15:45.630" style="s2">Which also ties for obvious reasons?</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.140" end="00:15:48.299" style="s2">And the key is to actually enable these things to be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.430" end="00:15:53.820" style="s2">relationship with each other and vital healthy relationship with each other, and I think that&#39;s in some sense the essence of what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.430" end="00:16:00.419" style="s2">Focusing on and instead of the core what he&#39;s asking about Peterson is hard for the broadcast media to get a handle on</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.760" end="00:16:05.369" style="s2">Because the depth of his thought means he doesn&#39;t fit easily into any of their categories</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.980" end="00:16:11.190" style="s2">The clash with Kathy Newman was his breakthrough a moment where the new world met the old</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.860" end="00:16:16.860" style="s2">To give the context from Kathy Newman side she has to do dozens of interviews each month</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:21.869" style="s2">Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he sure as hell looks controversial</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.360" end="00:16:29.729" style="s2">She&#39;s also focused on getting sound bites for a five minute cut down of the interview for TV. Not a long conversation for online</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.520" end="00:16:35.760" style="s2">The interview was ridiculous. It was a ridiculous interviewing. I listen to it or watched it several times</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.760" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">I was like this is so strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:43.289" style="s2">It&#39;s like her determination to turn into a conflict - it&#39;s one of the issues that I have with</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.660" end="00:16:49.839" style="s2">Television shows yeah, because they have a very limited amount of time, and they&#39;re trying to make things as salacious as possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.839" end="00:16:53.198" style="s2">They wouldn&#39;t have these sound bites these clickbait sound bites</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.199" end="00:16:59.469" style="s2">And she just went into it incredibly confrontational not trying to find your actual perspective</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:04.839" style="s2">But trying to force you to defend a non non realistic perspective. Yes well</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.839" end="00:17:11.649" style="s2">I was that I was the hypothetical villain of her imagination essentially. No this is also. Why YouTube is gonna kill TV</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.439" end="00:17:16.029" style="s2">Because television by its nature all of these narrow</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.699" end="00:17:18.620" style="s2">broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.620" end="00:17:20.620" style="s2">technologies they rely on</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.049" end="00:17:22.970" style="s2">forcing the story right because</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.970" end="00:17:24.309" style="s2">It has to happen now</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.309" end="00:17:30.038" style="s2">It has to happen in like often in five minutes because they only broadcast five minutes of that in interview</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.039" end="00:17:32.469" style="s2">They did put the whole thing up on YouTube to their credit</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.409" end="00:17:40.719" style="s2">It it it hasn&#39;t ceased to amaze me yet. I think that they thought that the interview went fine</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.450" end="00:17:46.299" style="s2">after the interview Channel four News found themselves at the center of an online storm</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.610" end="00:17:50.829" style="s2">Which included some nasty personal and misogynistic attacks?</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.050" end="00:17:56.829" style="s2">It&#39;s understandable that they just wanted it to go away</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:17:59.890" style="s2">But online is forever</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.890" end="00:18:06.729" style="s2">and as the center of gravity continues to shift away from traditional media this interview is I would argue a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.220" end="00:18:08.780" style="s2">slow-motion and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.780" end="00:18:13.269" style="s2">Continuing car crash for Channel 4&#39;s credibility, so why did it happen?</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:21.519" style="s2">Partly the limitations of the medium of TV, but also because of the institutional political blindness of the mainstream media</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.070" end="00:18:26.949" style="s2">I&#39;ve always considered myself of the liberal left, but especially since the election of Trump</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.050" end="00:18:31.119" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to understand what happened and I&#39;m convinced that the polarization</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.250" end="00:18:37.390" style="s2">We&#39;re seeing is mainly driven by the shadow side of liberalism in particular where supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.940" end="00:18:45.129" style="s2">Inclusive social justice liberalism stops being inclusive and secretly judges and despises people that don&#39;t think the same way</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.910" end="00:19:18.879" style="s2">it&#39;s about how a narrow social justice worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in the interview became the new status quo and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:22.690" style="s2">How this institutional bias of much of the mainstream media?</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:28.599" style="s2">Means it can&#39;t see or understand the forces that are challenging this new consensus</p>

<p begin="00:19:55.130" end="00:19:57.820" style="s2">What I minute II particularly like</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.150" end="00:20:01.690" style="s2">Greek philosophy and stoicism and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.780" end="00:20:07.690" style="s2">The alt-right who I&#39;ve always thought of you know if I come across on the tour. I thought the most kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.660" end="00:20:11.930" style="s2">Swivel-eyed bogeymen you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.380" end="00:20:15.300" style="s2">completely unpalatable</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.300" end="00:20:20.089" style="s2">extremists in their in their basements and then to discover that</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.120" end="00:20:26.510" style="s2">You know a lot of them were a lot of people in stoicism were also really into the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.090" end="00:20:30.620" style="s2">Made me wonder. What was going on and why?</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:34.009" style="s2">People like me were getting radicalized</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:37.430" style="s2">I&#39;m drawn into if you explain. What stoicism is for</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.420" end="00:20:47.060" style="s2">Stoicism is basically an ancient Greek philosophy, which was became very popular in the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.330" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">You know with like the Emperor Marcus Aurelius was a stoic for example?</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:56.630" style="s2">And it&#39;s in some ways like a Western form of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.970" end="00:21:01.040" style="s2">It&#39;s like a therapy for the emotions it teaches you to take</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.440" end="00:21:06.049" style="s2">Responsibility for your thoughts to take and thereby to take some control over your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.900" end="00:21:10.160" style="s2">so in some ways it&#39;s putting forward a model of</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.010" end="00:21:14.749" style="s2">strength and integrity and kind of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.290" end="00:21:23.570" style="s2">Amid adversity and rapid change so for that reason it&#39;s become very popular in the last 10 years I</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.300" end="00:21:28.369" style="s2">Think this is also. Why from my perspective at least someone like Jordan Pederson</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.890" end="00:21:33.829" style="s2">Is often looked from the outside as being aligned with the alt-right because he has a similar message</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.830" end="00:21:38.090" style="s2">But it&#39;s but there are crucial differences. I think between what we would consider</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.250" end="00:21:42.770" style="s2">I mean certainly white nationalism would be an essential part of the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.920" end="00:21:49.699" style="s2">I would say of any useful definition, and yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s certainly not characteristic of of Jordan Peterson from my experience</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.830" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">No, there&#39;s a crucial difference at least between stoicism and the alt-right</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.650" end="00:22:02.060" style="s2">Even though a lot of alt writers into stoicism in that stoicism, and and maybe Jordan Peterson as well</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.060" end="00:22:06.979" style="s2">I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not an expert on him talk about the way to gain strength and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.800" end="00:22:09.800" style="s2">maturity and power is</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.620" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">Internal it&#39;s to take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:21.050" style="s2">Whilst I think people sometimes men might look for that sense of power and control</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.990" end="00:22:23.990" style="s2">externally by</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.450" end="00:22:26.450" style="s2">suppressing or</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.179" end="00:22:33.769" style="s2">Segregating anyone who they feel threatened by whether that&#39;s other colours or other sexualities or</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.500" end="00:22:38.119" style="s2">Gender so there&#39;s a crucial difference there one is about kind of inner</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.580" end="00:22:43.280" style="s2">Integrity and and and just kind of being strong within yourself</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.280" end="00:22:47.359" style="s2">and the other is about trying to take control through the kind of exterior I</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.780" end="00:22:55.519" style="s2">Mean every public appearance that I&#39;ve made that&#39;s related to the sort of topics that were discussing is overwhelmingly men</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.799" end="00:22:58.039" style="s2">It&#39;s like it&#39;s like eighty-five to ninety percent</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.140" end="00:23:04.160" style="s2">And so I thought wow that&#39;s weird like what the hell&#39;s going on here exactly, and then the other thing. I&#39;ve noticed is that?</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.890" end="00:23:08.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking a lot to the crowds that I&#39;ve been talking to not about rights</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.660" end="00:23:15.469" style="s2">But about responsibility right because you can&#39;t have the bloody converse. What are you doing? You can&#39;t have the conversation about rights without the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.049" end="00:23:19.459" style="s2">conversation about responsibility because your rights are my</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.100" end="00:23:22.100" style="s2">Responsibility that&#39;s what they are</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.230" end="00:23:29.209" style="s2">Technically, so you just can&#39;t have only half of that discussion, and we&#39;re only having half that discussion the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.210" end="00:23:35.299" style="s2">What the hell are you leaving out if you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is what you&#39;re leaving out</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.640" end="00:23:37.999" style="s2">Responsibility and then the question is well</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:43.309" style="s2">What are you leaving out if you&#39;re leaving out responsibility and the answer might be well, maybe you&#39;re leaving out the meaning of life</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.340" end="00:23:47.150" style="s2">That&#39;s what it looks like to me. It&#39;s like here you are</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.059" end="00:23:51.289" style="s2">Suffering away, what makes it worthwhile, right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.230" end="00:23:57.140" style="s2">You know you&#39;re completely. Oh, you&#39;re completely you have no idea what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:03.049" style="s2">You it&#39;s almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.440" end="00:24:06.440" style="s2">responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.450" end="00:24:08.160" style="s2">That&#39;s what gives life meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.160" end="00:24:10.160" style="s2">It&#39;s like lift a load</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.440" end="00:24:13.640" style="s2">Then you can tolerate yourself right because look at your useless</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.340" end="00:24:17.630" style="s2">Easily hurt easily killed. Why should you have any self-respect?</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.270" end="00:24:20.270" style="s2">That&#39;s the story of the fall</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.549" end="00:24:25.129" style="s2">Pick something up and carry it pick make it heavy enough so that you can think yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.809" style="s2">Useless as I am at least I could move that from there to there well</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.809" end="00:24:36.409" style="s2">What&#39;s really cool about that is that when I talk to these crowds about this the man&#39;s eyes light and that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.410" end="00:24:38.509" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen that phenomena because I&#39;ve been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.640" end="00:24:44.870" style="s2">Mythological material for a long time and I can see when I&#39;m watching crowds people you know their eyebrows lift their eyes let light up</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.870" end="00:24:50.750" style="s2">Because I put something together for them. That&#39;s what mythological stories. Do so I&#39;m not taking responsibility for that</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.750" end="00:24:54.319" style="s2">That&#39;s what the stories do so I say the story and people go click click click</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.390" end="00:24:57.500" style="s2">You know in their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.500" end="00:25:03.739" style="s2">That&#39;s a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that. It is unbelievable. It just blows me away</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.750" end="00:25:07.939" style="s2">It&#39;s like really that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s the counterculture?</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.180" end="00:25:13.159" style="s2">Grow the hell up and do something useful really I could do that oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.160" end="00:25:19.639" style="s2">I&#39;m so excited by that idea no one ever mentioned that before it&#39;s like rights rights rights rights Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.640" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s appalling. It&#39;s and and I feel that that&#39;s deeply felt by the people who are who are coming out to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.140" end="00:25:30.980" style="s2">To listen to these sorts of things to they&#39;re they&#39;ve had enough of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.010" end="00:25:36.050" style="s2">So and they better have because it&#39;s it&#39;s a non-productive mode of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.780" end="00:25:37.890" style="s2">responsibility man</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.890" end="00:25:44.090" style="s2">Peterson is part of the counterculture that he describes himself as a classic liberal and yet he&#39;s frequently</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.250" end="00:25:46.430" style="s2">Described as right-wing by the media</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.250" end="00:25:49.400" style="s2">This is not limited to Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.860" end="00:25:55.459" style="s2">James d&#39;amours infamous Google memo was described everywhere as an anti diversity screed</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.160" end="00:26:00.680" style="s2">Despite him specifically stating he wanted to encourage more diversity in the workplace</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.400" end="00:26:14.930" style="s2">Many believe that the Channel 4 interview was a significant moment in exposing this mindset as dogmatic</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.909" style="s2">reactionary and fixed so during the interview we see an example of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:28.819" style="s2">Delusional framework that is what appears to be largely incapable of perceiving and reacting to reality in real time</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:34.730" style="s2">but much more interesting is what happened afterwards which was the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:41.870" style="s2">self-healing and policing mechanism of the larger social consensus of how when how the blue church</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.860" end="00:26:48.649" style="s2">Reactively goes about maintaining the integrity of its frame</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.360" end="00:26:54.199" style="s2">And so what ended up happened was there was a break in the frame there was a glitch in the matrix the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.040" end="00:27:02.749" style="s2">Mechanisms of the blue church reacted to endeavor to control the frame and to convert it into a way of sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.230" end="00:27:08.119" style="s2">Making sense of the what occurred that still maintained the integrity of its frame?</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.430" end="00:27:12.049" style="s2">Do you mean when they tried to characterize it as sort of?</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.630" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">abusive trolls and you&#39;re right hero, and all of that exactly exactly it&#39;s sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.150" end="00:27:21.560" style="s2">to use of a military language it was a fallback position that was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.900" end="00:27:27.920" style="s2">Reactive almost instinctual and not almost in fact precisely instinct was that pure habit there was no</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.640" end="00:27:32.060" style="s2">Thoughtfulness or even</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.540" end="00:27:34.620" style="s2">strategic</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.620" end="00:27:42.110" style="s2">Action there it was if if X then Y and in this case Y is. Here&#39;s a set of things that one does to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:44.720" style="s2">re-establish the dominant frame and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.600" end="00:27:48.919" style="s2">Now we&#39;re now were two levels deep you know the first. Level was a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.560" end="00:27:55.190" style="s2">sort of self-evident disaster, but then the second level was also a relatively self-evident disaster and</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.310" end="00:27:58.310" style="s2">There isn&#39;t really a third level</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.680" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">In this approach so it ends up happening, and this is again. You can kind of just think about this from ordinary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.120" end="00:28:07.050" style="s2">This is how?</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.050" end="00:28:08.550" style="s2">delusions fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.550" end="00:28:15.050" style="s2">As try as we might our desire to interpret reality to mean what we wanted to mean at the end of the day. We&#39;ll always</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.660" end="00:28:18.290" style="s2">Be checked against what reality actually is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.230" end="00:28:24.619" style="s2">It may be some time. You know we&#39;re pretty good at making things up and pretending, but eventually</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.410" end="00:28:29.480" style="s2">Reality is reality this isn&#39;t to say that Peterson is not controversial</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.300" end="00:28:35.930" style="s2">He&#39;s saying things that challenge the most deeply held assumptions of the new establishment narrative</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.930" end="00:28:38.419" style="s2">I guess the other reason that people are on</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.490" end="00:28:45.530" style="s2">My case to some degree is because I have made a strong case which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.530" end="00:28:51.379" style="s2">Are intrinsic differences say between men and women and I think the evidence and that this is the thing that staggered me is that?</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.870" end="00:28:56.810" style="s2">No serious scientists have debated that for like four decades</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.390" end="00:29:05.059" style="s2">It&#39;s that argument was done by the time. I went to graduate school everyone knew that human beings were not a blank slate that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.970" end="00:29:07.970" style="s2">biological forces not</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.669" end="00:29:16.579" style="s2">Parameterised the way that we thought and and felt and acted and and and valued everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.889" end="00:29:18.629" style="s2">debatable again is just</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.629" end="00:29:21.949" style="s2">Especially because it&#39;s being done by legislative Fiat. They&#39;re forcing it</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:28.548" style="s2">Part of Peterson&#39;s argument based on years of psychological research is that much of the political?</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.980" end="00:29:34.819" style="s2">Conflicts are due to try to integrate the different political temperaments of men and women</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.399" end="00:29:42.469" style="s2">we were talking about the relatively the relative evolutionary roles of men and women this is speculative obviously and and</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.139" end="00:29:48.919" style="s2">Because our research did indicate. It&#39;s tentative research so far that that the the the SG is</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.559" end="00:29:54.949" style="s2">SJW sort of equality above all else philosophy is more prevalent among women</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.279" end="00:30:03.108" style="s2">It&#39;s predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women so agreeable this and high negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.840" end="00:30:10.970" style="s2">Primarily agreeableness, but in addition. It&#39;s also predicted by being female and so I&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot because</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.669" end="00:30:14.388" style="s2">well men are bailing out of the humanities like mad and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.700" end="00:30:18.590" style="s2">Pretty much out of the university is except for stem the women are moving in like mad</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.590" end="00:30:22.970" style="s2">And they&#39;re also moving into the political sphere like mad, and this is new right</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.970" end="00:30:26.299" style="s2">we&#39;ve never had this happen before and we do know know do not know what the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.369" end="00:30:30.619" style="s2">Significance of it is it&#39;s only 50 years old and so we were thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.619" end="00:30:33.529" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t know what you think about this proposition, but</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.049" end="00:30:36.918" style="s2">imagine that that that historically speaking, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.739" end="00:30:39.119" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.119" end="00:30:42.919" style="s2">Women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.980" end="00:30:49.849" style="s2">Something like that and maybe maybe that&#39;s only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.850" end="00:30:56.600" style="s2">But that doesn&#39;t matter because that&#39;s most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways what the women does did was make sure that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.600" end="00:30:58.289" style="s2">Got enough</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.289" end="00:31:05.508" style="s2">okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that&#39;s driving at least in part the SJW demand for for equity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.509" end="00:31:10.009" style="s2">Equality it&#39;s like let&#39;s make sure everybody has enough. It&#39;s like look fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.009" end="00:31:12.289" style="s2">You know I mean you can&#39;t you can&#39;t argue with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.480" end="00:31:15.769" style="s2">but there&#39;s there&#39;s an antipathy between that and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.260" end="00:31:21.629" style="s2">The the reality of differential productivity you know because people really do differ in their productivity</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.630" end="00:31:24.780" style="s2">I think that the SJW phenomena is different</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.780" end="00:31:29.729" style="s2">and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.429" end="00:31:35.369" style="s2">We don&#39;t know what women are like when they have political power because they&#39;ve never had it</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.370" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s been queens obviously and that sort of thing there&#39;s been female authority figures and females have</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.900" end="00:31:45.780" style="s2">Wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit, but this is a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.780" end="00:31:51.569" style="s2">And we don&#39;t know what what a truly female political philosophy would be like, but it might be</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.150" end="00:31:53.970" style="s2">Especially if it&#39;s not been well examined</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.970" end="00:31:59.880" style="s2">And it isn&#39;t very sophisticated conceptually it could easily be let&#39;s make sure things you&#39;ve distributed equally. Well, yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.350" end="00:32:04.350" style="s2">Why</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.340" end="00:32:10.260" style="s2">One of Peterson&#39;s main influences is the psychologist Carl Jung</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.169" end="00:32:19.019" style="s2">Young psychology was built around the concept of the shadow all the things about ourselves. We don&#39;t want to accept our anger</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.690" end="00:32:20.860" style="s2">negativity</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.860" end="00:32:25.860" style="s2">Unconscious judgments, and how we need to integrate all those disowned parts to grow</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.500" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">I&#39;m convinced. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening on a vast cultural level</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:33.270" style="s2">since leaving channel 4 news</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.270" end="00:32:38.040" style="s2">I&#39;ve retrained as a counselor and started leading personal growth workshops for men</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.380" end="00:32:43.499" style="s2">And thought a lot about how these unconscious gender dynamics are playing out in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.679" end="00:32:49.589" style="s2">One of the central concepts is Jung&#39;s idea of animus and anima possession</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.809" end="00:32:53.759" style="s2">How each have both an inner masculine and feminine essence in?</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.130" end="00:33:00.179" style="s2">A man when he&#39;s unconsciously possessed by his feminine side his anima he becomes withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.549" end="00:33:05.939" style="s2">Moody and reactive and when a woman is possessed by her male side the animus</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.220" end="00:33:09.030" style="s2">she becomes aggressive and dominating and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.669" end="00:33:13.409" style="s2">How many women are pushed into that by the nature of the modern workplace?</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:21.299" style="s2">The Kathy Newman I know is warm compassionate a successful and talented journalist none of this is criticism of her</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.580" end="00:33:23.939" style="s2">Just the role she was playing in the interview</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.940" end="00:33:29.250" style="s2">I would say technically and this is might be interesting for people who are interested in union psychology</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:35.249" style="s2">If you want to understand what Carl Jung meant by animus possession which is a very difficult concept?</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.590" end="00:33:39.060" style="s2">Then that that interview was a textbook case of</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.090" end="00:33:47.610" style="s2">having a discussion with someone who is animus possessed life has been moving forward for three and a half billion years and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.280" end="00:33:55.709" style="s2">It moves forward in these pattered and manners like the dominance hierarchy for example, so that&#39;s that let&#39;s call that the masculine archetype</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.710" end="00:33:58.829" style="s2">It&#39;s part of the masculine archetype in fact the onus</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.430" end="00:34:03.719" style="s2">Proclamation was that the female representation of the male</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.510" end="00:34:06.690" style="s2">so that&#39;s the animus is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.420" end="00:34:09.630" style="s2">Dominance hierarchy it&#39;s the patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.870" end="00:34:15.929" style="s2">So that&#39;s that that&#39;s the unconscious archetype, which I think is extremely interesting given</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.929" end="00:34:20.039" style="s2">what&#39;s happened say in the women&#39;s movement because that&#39;s what&#39;s projected onto men and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.740" end="00:34:21.850" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.850" end="00:34:23.939" style="s2">It can be projected in a very negative way</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.940" end="00:34:30.210" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to be but it can be and so an animus possessed woman treats a man as if he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.639" end="00:34:34.979" style="s2">Manifestation of the tyrannical patriarchy he&#39;s a group he&#39;s that group of men</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.560" end="00:34:42.570" style="s2">Yeah, the group of bad men actually you watched the Jordan Peterson Kathy Newman entity. What did he what did he think I?</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.560" end="00:34:50.070" style="s2">My whole body contracted, and I I felt so sad for</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.919" end="00:34:52.919" style="s2">womanhood I felt</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.649" end="00:34:56.128" style="s2">disappointed and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.700" end="00:34:59.700" style="s2">Could see how</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.130" end="00:35:05.040" style="s2">the shadow part of womanhood was acting out I could see how the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:10.530" style="s2">collective rage was acting through Kathy Newman and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.140" end="00:35:17.940" style="s2">This is what happens is that when that&#39;s unknown its projected blindly on to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.460" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">Whatever stick wherever it sticks</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:26.699" style="s2">and it was very clear that she already had an agenda and she already had a projection that she was just</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.130" end="00:35:33.960" style="s2">Looking to state she was she was just looking to have that confirmed so I felt on behalf of women</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.960" end="00:35:39.000" style="s2">I felt sad and disappointed because we need to have intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.670" end="00:35:42.149" style="s2">conversations, and I also want to say that this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.730" end="00:35:48.330" style="s2">even though the the specific example is the Kathy Newman Jordan Peterson interview, it&#39;s not specific to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">- Kathy Newman I think the fact that that interview has resonated with so many people that it&#39;s been so popular shows that actually something</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.310" end="00:36:00.299" style="s2">archetypal was going on in that in that interaction</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.300" end="00:36:06.989" style="s2">And I think as well why it&#39;s gone viral is a lot of people watching it</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.510" end="00:36:10.379" style="s2">Recognize those dynamics. They&#39;re like I&#39;ve been in conversations like that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.600" end="00:36:15.419" style="s2">I&#39;ve been in this conversation where nothing I say works where nothing I say gets through</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.450" end="00:36:21.389" style="s2">So there&#39;s something sort of fundamental about about the masculine feminine dynamic. That&#39;s going on in there</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.540" end="00:36:26.189" style="s2">What do you think that is I think Jordan Peterson? He&#39;s everyman Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.290" end="00:36:30.449" style="s2">She&#39;s every woman I can tap into that rage like this</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.450" end="00:36:37.080" style="s2">I know it in myself and women that say they don&#39;t they&#39;re just denying it because it is in the collective</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.270" end="00:36:40.649" style="s2">So in that sense it just highlighted what what&#39;s that?</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.650" end="00:36:46.619" style="s2">It&#39;s wonderful because here we really get to look at why is this so?</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:50.669" style="s2">Important why is it so important to listen to?</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.130" end="00:36:57.150" style="s2">To a thinker like Jordan Peterson and take it seriously and say what can we do with it?</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.250" end="00:37:00.359" style="s2">It&#39;s just so obvious that it&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.670" end="00:37:08.369" style="s2">Because if this is where we are if this is where society and cultures is if this is the ability to have an intelligent conversations</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.980" end="00:37:12.600" style="s2">Conversation then we are in trouble, I really feel that there is this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.300" end="00:37:14.680" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.680" end="00:37:17.609" style="s2">subconscious rage that is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.010" end="00:37:24.149" style="s2">boiling in women and it&#39;s coming up in so many ways we see we see in the media and</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.910" end="00:37:26.910" style="s2">What&#39;s going on is this?</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:28.750" style="s2">unknown</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.750" end="00:37:32.040" style="s2">Rage that comes up in in many different ways um</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.590" end="00:37:40.499" style="s2">And on one hand it needs to come out we need to clear it it needs to be expressed it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.500" end="00:37:47.340" style="s2">Be acknowledged on the other hand it&#39;s not enough. This is only like this is breaking the ice</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.010" end="00:37:52.199" style="s2">So that the next step of evolution, can you know?</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.230" end="00:37:58.130" style="s2">Consciousness can start coming through and that&#39;s what I&#39;m lacking in women. It&#39;s really to take</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.800" end="00:38:02.390" style="s2">responsibility for what we do as women in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:10.279" style="s2">Manipulation in our seduction in our control, and and it&#39;s so easy for women to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.280" end="00:38:14.719" style="s2">but that&#39;s just because we angry and men did this and patriarchy, but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.240" end="00:38:17.070" style="s2">It&#39;s such a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.070" end="00:38:18.810" style="s2">responsibility and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.810" end="00:38:22.429" style="s2">Women really need to know I mean, that&#39;s the the kind of shadow work is</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.100" end="00:38:28.850" style="s2">The acceptance that we all have shadows that men certainly have a shadow. There is a shadow around masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.670" end="00:38:31.879" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a shadow around femininity and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.700" end="00:38:40.550" style="s2">while part of the cultural conversation now is toxic masculinity and everyone knows what you mean by toxic toxic masculinity if</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">You talk about toxic femininity</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.620" end="00:38:46.489" style="s2">Everyone still knows what you mean, but you can&#39;t have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.160" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">Which is it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting?</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.230" end="00:38:54.709" style="s2">What is allowed to be said and what is not allowed to be said at the moment and that that I think is?</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.380" end="00:38:57.380" style="s2">is very</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.200" end="00:39:02.840" style="s2">Dangerous that certain topics certain conversations are off are off-limits</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.120" end="00:39:09.709" style="s2">And this is where we see where we see the victim persecutor dynamics activates it because women</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.140" end="00:39:14.390" style="s2">become the become the victims, and we make ourselves the victims and we</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.970" end="00:39:21.199" style="s2">Persecute men but in that aggression in that rage and when we are the victims. We are in perfect control</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.720" end="00:39:24.500" style="s2">we become the persecutors because we say</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.860" end="00:39:27.860" style="s2">It&#39;s all about blame</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.050" end="00:39:30.620" style="s2">Men did this and men need to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.170" end="00:39:38.570" style="s2">But in that we become the persecutors, and it&#39;s also very difficult as well because one imagines that that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.540" end="00:39:43.459" style="s2">Combative attitude is something that has served her well in the past and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.830" end="00:39:49.459" style="s2">She&#39;s maybe felt forced into because of the nature of the society that she&#39;s operating in so it&#39;s a kind of catch-22 situation</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.830" end="00:39:54.830" style="s2">for the many successful women because they feel that they&#39;re pushed to be more masculine and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.620" end="00:40:00.109" style="s2">Then when they&#39;re more masculine they get judged for being more masculine</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.140" end="00:40:06.199" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s very sad and and and I can see that dynamics being played out absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.780" end="00:40:11.489" style="s2">But I think the only thing we can do is to take responsibility okay?</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.530" end="00:40:17.969" style="s2">I&#39;m doing that do I really want to compromise my femininity do I want to compromise my integrity?</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.820" end="00:40:21.509" style="s2">Do I want to compromise my gender and?</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.730" end="00:40:28.260" style="s2">Play that or is there another way that I can be powerful without being aggressive without playing a power game</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.420" end="00:40:30.719" style="s2">But resting in my natural power</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.300" end="00:40:33.300" style="s2">resting in my natural dignity</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.460" end="00:40:37.830" style="s2">Resting in that deep rootedness that we both have in our genders that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.680" end="00:40:42.120" style="s2">When we are peace with it and when we acknowledge it in ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.810" end="00:40:48.660" style="s2">It&#39;s there as a natural thing and and this is the thing I don&#39;t want to make this personal about Kathy Newman</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.820" end="00:40:55.199" style="s2">Because it&#39;s it&#39;s in that potential is in every woman, but it&#39;s because we are persecuting our own femininity</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.900" end="00:41:01.319" style="s2">What&#39;s being played out that we&#39;re doing it to ourselves because we don&#39;t trust that it&#39;s good enough to be a woman</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.320" end="00:41:08.489" style="s2">We don&#39;t trust that we can have conversations that come from a felt embodied perspective. We don&#39;t trust that we&#39;re connected to truth</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">because these these</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:16.799" style="s2">Masculine ways have been have been very strong and women have been denying their own power</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.170" end="00:41:22.080" style="s2">In my work over many years of working with this I find that very few women</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.410" end="00:41:25.859" style="s2">Grew up in households which really?</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.530" end="00:41:28.890" style="s2">Loved admired respected honored</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.800" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">cherished the feminine and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.170" end="00:41:39.570" style="s2">So there is intrinsically for so many women who&#39;ve grown up in the I don&#39;t know the last hundred years that say</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.910" end="00:41:47.099" style="s2">A kind of devaluation of the feminine that gets taken on and of course and as well as abuse</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.350" end="00:41:49.829" style="s2">aggression all sorts of things so very</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.100" end="00:41:54.569" style="s2">Many women out of an intelligent strategy to survive</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.210" end="00:42:01.710" style="s2">Develop their masculine side as a defense against that devaluation for the feminine and over time they become very</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.020" end="00:42:06.300" style="s2">Identified with that masculine side the male equivalent is animal possession</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.910" end="00:42:12.959" style="s2">in anima possession it&#39;s the loss of relaxed confidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.540" end="00:42:18.689" style="s2">Groundedness in the masculine and is overwhelmed by his own inner feminine side</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.290" end="00:42:21.389" style="s2">a passive withdrawn</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">moody</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">bitchy</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.480" end="00:42:27.430" style="s2">Complaining</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.430" end="00:42:33.899" style="s2">not showing up kind of guy, which I think is really so much what feminists are angry about I</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.900" end="00:42:38.370" style="s2">Don&#39;t see them as really angry about the masculine per se but it the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.890" end="00:42:42.780" style="s2">Males behave, and you know I have got a lot of compassion for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.390" end="00:42:49.140" style="s2">Because for myself and most men that I know we weren&#39;t really shown how to be as men</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.140" end="00:42:55.530" style="s2">We didn&#39;t really get initiated into it and so and then this strong thing comes from feminism</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.530" end="00:43:03.449" style="s2">And we feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s maleness. That&#39;s wrong, and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not maleness. That&#39;s wrong. I don&#39;t even think feminism</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.240" end="00:43:05.530" style="s2">feminists hate</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.530" end="00:43:11.639" style="s2">The masculine it&#39;s like what the call is really for men is to develop their masculine</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.220" end="00:43:13.270" style="s2">strength</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.270" end="00:43:15.270" style="s2">presence courage</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.370" end="00:43:19.169" style="s2">be relaxed and confident be protective and be strong and</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.620" end="00:43:26.909" style="s2">Under this kind of assault which has come from a lot of animus possessed women a lot of men have retreated</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.010" end="00:43:32.489" style="s2">And I think gone into feeling guilty about being men and have become passive</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.730" end="00:43:40.409" style="s2">Indecisive and in that way a kind of feminized man has emerged</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">Those who followed Peterson&#39;s thought</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.410" end="00:43:51.629" style="s2">recognize his analysis goes all the way down to the bedrock to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.880" end="00:43:59.130" style="s2">Archetypal structures of consciousness itself the thing that I really see happening and you can tell me what you think about this in annoyance book</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.890" end="00:44:06.690" style="s2">Consciousness which is masculine symbolically masculine for a variety of reasons is is viewed as rising up?</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.720" end="00:44:11.129" style="s2">against the countervailing force of tragedy from an underlying</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.650" end="00:44:17.340" style="s2">Feminine symbolically feminine unconsciousness right and it&#39;s something that can always be pulled back into that unconsciousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.380" end="00:44:21.660" style="s2">That would be the microcosm of that would be the Freudian eatable mother</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.210" end="00:44:25.080" style="s2">Familial dynamic where the mother is so over</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.960" end="00:44:30.720" style="s2">Protective and all-encompassing that she interferes with the development of the competence not only of her sons</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.720" end="00:44:35.689" style="s2">But also of her daughter of her children in general, and it seems to me that that&#39;s the dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.690" end="00:44:36.900" style="s2">That&#39;s being played out in our</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.900" end="00:44:42.470" style="s2">Society right now is that there&#39;s this and it&#39;s it&#39;s related in some way that I don&#39;t understand to this to this</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:49.879" style="s2">Insistence that all forms of masculine Authority are nothing, but tyrannical power so the symbolic representation is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.670" end="00:44:54.680" style="s2">tyrannical father with no appreciation for the benevolent father and</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:45:00.409" style="s2">benevolent mother with no appreciation whatsoever for the tyrannical mother right and that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.569" end="00:45:03.529" style="s2">Because I thought of ideologies as fragmentary mythologies</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:05.250" style="s2">That&#39;s where they get their</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.250" end="00:45:11.839" style="s2">archetypal and psychological power right and so in a balanced representation you have the terrible mother and the Great Mother as</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.420" end="00:45:16.579" style="s2">Anointment laid out so nicely and you have the terrible father and the great father</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.579" end="00:45:19.759" style="s2">So that&#39;s the fact that culture mangles you have to death well</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.760" end="00:45:26.089" style="s2">It&#39;s also promoting you and developing you you have to see that as balanced, and then you have the heroic and adversarial individual</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.190" end="00:45:30.200" style="s2">But in the postmodern world and this seems to be something that&#39;s increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:35.359" style="s2">Seeping out into the culture at large you have nothing but the tyrannical father nothing</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.359" end="00:45:40.519" style="s2">But the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing, but the benevolent</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.339" end="00:45:46.818" style="s2">Benevolent great mother and it&#39;s a it&#39;s an appalling ideology, and it seems to me that it&#39;s sucking the vitality</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.579" end="00:45:53.719" style="s2">Which is exactly what you would expect symbolically, it&#39;s sucking the vitality of our culture you see that with the increasing</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.630" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">demolition of of young men</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.299" end="00:46:00.349" style="s2">And not only young men in terms of their academic performance</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.450" end="00:46:07.429" style="s2">Which like they&#39;re falling way behind in elementary school way behind in junior high and bailing out of the universities like mad and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.500" end="00:46:14.239" style="s2">And I well the public school education it&#39;s become completely permeated by this kind of my anti male propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:17.929" style="s2">I mean, and I need to mean public schools are just a form of imprisonment. You know right now</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.930" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">They&#39;re particularly destructive to young men who have a lot of physical energy</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.049" end="00:46:25.609" style="s2">You know you know I identify as transgender gay mic myself way</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.609" end="00:46:29.298" style="s2">But I do not I do not require the entire world</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.460" end="00:46:34.520" style="s2">To alter itself okay to fit my particular the self-image I do believe in</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.890" end="00:46:42.109" style="s2">The power of hormones I believe that men exist and women exist and they are biologically different. I think that I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.750" end="00:46:44.279" style="s2">no cure for</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.279" end="00:46:50.299" style="s2">the culture eles right now except if men start standing opera in demanding that they be</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.580" end="00:46:52.970" style="s2">Respected as men here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.970" end="00:46:58.279" style="s2">You know this is something my wife is pointed out to she said well men are gonna have to stand up for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.280" end="00:47:02.239" style="s2">But here&#39;s the problem. I know how to stand up to a man who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.850" end="00:47:04.140" style="s2">Who&#39;s?</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.140" end="00:47:05.640" style="s2">unfairly</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.640" end="00:47:11.210" style="s2">Trespassing against me and the reason I know that is because the parameters for my resistance are quite well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.340" end="00:47:16.430" style="s2">Which is we talk? We argue? We push and then it becomes physical?</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.980" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">Right like if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.700" end="00:47:26.029" style="s2">We know what the next step is ok, that&#39;s forbidden in in discourse with women</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.030" end="00:47:32.150" style="s2">So I don&#39;t know like it seems to me that it isn&#39;t men that have to stand up and say enough of this even though</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.150" end="00:47:34.940" style="s2">That is what they should do it seems to me that it&#39;s saying women</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.160" end="00:47:41.180" style="s2">Who have to stand up against their crazy sisters and say look enough of that enough man-hating enough?</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.610" end="00:47:47.870" style="s2">Pathology enough bringing disgrace on us as a gender but the problem there</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.870" end="00:47:54.920" style="s2">And then I&#39;ll stop my little tirade is that most of the women. I know who are saying are busy doing same things, right?</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.920" end="00:47:57.409" style="s2">They&#39;re off they have their career. They have their family</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.410" end="00:47:58.130" style="s2">They&#39;re quite occupied</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.130" end="00:48:04.460" style="s2">And they don&#39;t seem to have the time or maybe even the interest to go after their their crazy harpy sisters</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.460" end="00:48:09.769" style="s2">And so I don&#39;t see any regulating force for that that terrible femininity, and it seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.550" end="00:48:18.140" style="s2">Invading the culture and undermining the the masculine power of the culture in a way, that&#39;s I think fatal</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.140" end="00:48:23.900" style="s2">I really do believe that I too I too believe these are symptomatic of the decline of Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.900" end="00:48:27.889" style="s2">And we and it will just go down flat. I don&#39;t think people realize that you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.470" end="00:48:33.799" style="s2">Masculinity still exists okay in the world as a code among jihadists, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.870" end="00:48:36.799" style="s2">And when you have passionate masculinity, okay?</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.170" end="00:48:43.519" style="s2">Circling the borders like the Huns and the Vandals during the Roman Empire that that&#39;s what I see I see this culture rotting from within</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.590" end="00:48:45.060" style="s2">okay, and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.060" end="00:48:47.060" style="s2">disemboweling itself literally</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.329" end="00:48:55.250" style="s2">We have this</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.250" end="00:48:57.250" style="s2">Bit of combat let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.769" end="00:48:59.769" style="s2">It produced a scandal</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:01.789" style="s2">Now we actually talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.789" end="00:49:02.319" style="s2">Yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.319" end="00:49:04.569" style="s2">No tricks just a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.569" end="00:49:09.369" style="s2">And then everybody wins right because I can admit whatever mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.369" end="00:49:11.739" style="s2">I made she can admit whatever mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.740" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">She made we can drop the persona</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.269" end="00:49:20.319" style="s2">So you&#39;re saying the polarization that we&#39;re seeing right now that we are speaking out. It&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.170" end="00:49:25.089" style="s2">In the future we will act out that polarization well if we don&#39;t if we keep</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.400" end="00:49:30.940" style="s2">Accelerating it especially if we keep accelerating with lies. Yeah, you know and and this this whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.420" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">channel for</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:39.039" style="s2">Rat&#39;s nest is like 90% lies. Maybe more and</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.589" end="00:49:46.719" style="s2">You know a lot of its ideologically motivated lies, but it doesn&#39;t matter it still lies like Kathy as I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:52.778" style="s2">There was virtually nothing she said in that interview that was actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.150" end="00:49:59.230" style="s2">Coming from her like like a deep part of her the soul of her or so it was all persona</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.230" end="00:50:01.629" style="s2">It was all persona and and and all</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.450" end="00:50:04.450" style="s2">use of words in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.059" end="00:50:08.169" style="s2">Expedient manner as tools to obtain I think probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.230" end="00:50:10.819" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.819" end="00:50:13.899" style="s2">status dominant status and reputation</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.150" end="00:50:16.750" style="s2">I mean what advice would you give to people to?</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.210" end="00:50:24.609" style="s2">To navigate this new world the first is for your mind. Be aware of the fact that the habits of the blue church and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.250" end="00:50:27.140" style="s2">And how it works</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.140" end="00:50:31.809" style="s2">Don&#39;t work anymore recognize that your way of making sense in the world that used to work</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.809" end="00:50:35.499" style="s2">Don&#39;t work, and you really really need to set yourself free to begin learning the new</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.500" end="00:50:38.500" style="s2">child&#39;s mind beginner&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.289" end="00:50:41.269" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.269" end="00:50:44.709" style="s2">this by nature must in fact be exploratory so</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.349" end="00:50:53.229" style="s2">Swim, do not make sense prematurely in spite of the fact that the world feels dangerous inside of that you may want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.529" end="00:50:56.979" style="s2">protect yourself in this dangerous world</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.630" end="00:51:04.910" style="s2">Doing so too quickly did not allow the natural exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:08.630" style="s2">Approach to do what it needs to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.450" end="00:51:11.450" style="s2">really, just listen and</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.820" end="00:51:14.989" style="s2">Learn go all the way dad back down to human base</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.720" end="00:51:17.340" style="s2">Turn inward</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.340" end="00:51:19.459" style="s2">Learn how fear shows up in you</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.190" end="00:51:23.990" style="s2">Learn how not to allow fear to drive the choices that you make</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.260" end="00:51:31.370" style="s2">Learn how to listen to the whole way that all of you perceives. What&#39;s going on become more integrated with your own body</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.040" end="00:51:33.720" style="s2">Go out into nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.720" end="00:51:36.800" style="s2">Spend a lot of time not connected to the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.800" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">That&#39;s going on and a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.090" end="00:51:46.579" style="s2">Reconnecting yourself with your fundamental capacity to perceive reality in all the different modalities these human beings have the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.690" end="00:51:54.440" style="s2">Then relearn how to use other human beings as allies in figuring out how to make sense of the world I</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.110" end="00:51:59.630" style="s2">mean that really relearn like we have been abused and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.900" end="00:52:02.900" style="s2">constrained by</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.030" end="00:52:06.199" style="s2">institutional frameworks that remove us from our own native capabilities</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.570" end="00:52:13.039" style="s2">So relearn that understand how to be a friend and an ally how to have a conversation with somebody where you&#39;re really listening closely</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.410" end="00:52:19.190" style="s2">To get a sense of what their perspective brings to you where you&#39;re not obligated to agree with them</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.190" end="00:52:23.570" style="s2">We are not obligated to move out of what you feel is right to form some new</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.600" end="00:52:27.439" style="s2">Consensus reality, but where you&#39;re actually authentically?</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.140" end="00:52:32.180" style="s2">Recognizing that their perspective has some capacity to bring richness to your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.330" end="00:52:39.769" style="s2">This by the way is almost exclusively possible in person and what we&#39;re doing right now is an OK version of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.770" end="00:52:41.770" style="s2">But we need to be very mindful the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:46.280" style="s2">Linear broadcast is bad and even interactive</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.220" end="00:52:51.169" style="s2">Bandwidth like this. It&#39;s not good enough. You know you&#39;ve got to learn from raw</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.930" end="00:52:58.129" style="s2">Physical and get yourself into places where your consensus reality, and your habits are willfully destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.610" end="00:53:04.099" style="s2">Human to human conversations and and get as far away from ideology as you can</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.830" end="00:53:07.340" style="s2">Your job is not to know what the fuck is going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.620" end="00:53:13.579" style="s2">Your job is to be absolutely certain that you have no idea what the fuck is going on and learn how to feel from raw</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.790" end="00:53:15.790" style="s2">chaos from raw uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.230" end="00:53:18.230" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.360" end="00:53:23.689" style="s2">Then and only then are you finally able to begin the journey of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.510" end="00:53:27.050" style="s2">Beginning to form a collective intelligence in this new environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.690" end="00:53:29.460" style="s2">That&#39;s my advice</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.460" end="00:53:36.500" style="s2">this is why we&#39;ve created rebel wisdom to host these conversations to try and unpack what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.110" end="00:53:39.110" style="s2">through our workshops and events</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.300" end="00:53:42.439" style="s2">Start to build this collective intelligence for the future</p>
