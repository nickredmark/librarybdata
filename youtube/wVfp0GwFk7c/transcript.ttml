<p begin="00:00:00.060" end="00:00:06.930" style="s2">so the three things that are happening</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:08.929" style="s2">in that video one is Stewart Kaufman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.930" end="00:00:12.960" style="s2">the adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.929" end="00:00:20.670" style="s2">the second is Greg&#39;s tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.960" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">yeah and the the third is the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.670" end="00:00:23.519" style="s2">inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:24.840" style="s2">since bunny so Daniel smacking burger</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.519" end="00:00:29.640" style="s2">now I&#39;ve been going back and forth on</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.840" end="00:00:30.929" style="s2">the inquiry of what is the battery I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.640" end="00:00:33.050" style="s2">gonna have to explain what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.929" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">this but what&#39;s the battery of a cydia</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.050" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">right and and the way when I put that</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:42.600" style="s2">question to him I said look one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.500" style="s2">moments of genius of Elaan musk one of</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.600" end="00:00:47.460" style="s2">the many but one of the most I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.500" end="00:00:52.260" style="s2">central is the call a strategic grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.460" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">Moore&#39;s law and so it would the the the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:59.039" style="s2">battery which is to say energy density</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:01.559" style="s2">per dollar specifically the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.039" end="00:01:04.909" style="s2">technological complex which right now</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.559" end="00:01:07.560" style="s2">shows that there&#39;s lithium-ion batteries</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.909" end="00:01:08.790" style="s2">has this characteristic in the context</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.560" end="00:01:10.080" style="s2">of the electric motor so someone like</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.790" end="00:01:11.189" style="s2">these two relationships you that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.080" end="00:01:13.619" style="s2">electric motor which is like a</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.189" end="00:01:17.189" style="s2">fundamental architecture then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.619" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">the the battery which is the rate limit</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.189" end="00:01:21.750" style="s2">on the potential of that fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">architecture right and you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.750" end="00:01:28.110" style="s2">series of step functions or trophic</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">cascades and with what must grasp was</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.110" end="00:01:36.180" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way to order things such</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:43.560" style="s2">that the larger milieu in this case</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.180" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">capitalism will orient activity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.560" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">exploring the adjacent possible in</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">battery space up to some limit and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:57.750" style="s2">you if you if you get to a particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:02:01.170" style="s2">location which is the Tesla Roadster you</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.750" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">can combine the power density over</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.170" end="00:02:08.789" style="s2">dollar of a battery space at that moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:11.610" style="s2">with the electric motor to produce a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.789" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">change a feedback loop back into</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.610" end="00:02:15.270" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">which generates more resource allocation</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.270" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2">like we&#39;re money fund R&amp;D in exploring</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:24.660" style="s2">battery space which because battery</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.740" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">spaces on this Moore&#39;s law and an</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:29.820" style="s2">ethical point is on this moore&#39;s law</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:32.160" style="s2">gets you on some form of exponential</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.820" end="00:02:33.690" style="s2">growth or in this case exponential</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.160" end="00:02:36.810" style="s2">decline in cost depending on your</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.690" end="00:02:39.630" style="s2">preference so a for example at $1,000</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.810" end="00:02:42.030" style="s2">per kilowatt hour the only thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:45.090" style="s2">marketable at all is the tesla roadster</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.030" end="00:02:47.400" style="s2">it is very very narrow territory right</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.090" end="00:02:49.470" style="s2">once the Tesla Roadster hits it</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.400" end="00:02:52.620" style="s2">generates enough for resources to then</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.470" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">move batteries along there Moore&#39;s Law</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.620" end="00:02:59.130" style="s2">curve to the point where in call it 18</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:01.890" style="s2">months doesn&#39;t matter it has so $500 per</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.130" end="00:03:04.739" style="s2">kilowatt hour but $500 per kilowatt hour</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.890" end="00:03:06.450" style="s2">now notion rate then own little machines</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.739" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">right right but now you could do the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.450" end="00:03:10.709" style="s2">Tesla Model S which is a hundred times</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:11.910" style="s2">more market space like the volume of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.709" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">that market space is a hundred times</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.910" end="00:03:15.570" style="s2">larger than the most maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:18.480" style="s2">thousand times maybe sing sort of some</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.570" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">attitude which then recursively</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.480" end="00:03:23.450" style="s2">generates another flow of resources that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">allows you to do the work necessary the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.450" end="00:03:28.410" style="s2">what&#39;s it called in calculus language</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:30.330" style="s2">it&#39;s the the thermodynamic cycle the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.410" end="00:03:31.830" style="s2">thermodynamic neighbor it provides the</p>

<p begin="00:03:36.150" end="00:03:41.010" style="s2">then move you to the next step function</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.340" end="00:03:42.840" style="s2">in Moore&#39;s law which is then $250 per</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.010" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">kilowatt hour which then unlocks the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.840" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">model three which is you know call it</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.850" end="00:03:49.260" style="s2">six orders of magnitude more marker</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.660" style="s2">marketability you get this series of</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.260" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">feedback loop so it&#39;s actually like a so</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.660" end="00:03:58.410" style="s2">it&#39;s funny the the actual electric</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:02.730" style="s2">engine in this case is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.410" end="00:04:08.640" style="s2">metaphor for a tap engine adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.730" end="00:04:10.320" style="s2">possible engine and then what Greg talks</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.640" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">about is greg actually talks about if</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.320" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">you just zoom out and you take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:20.700" style="s2">the kind of the macro story of what the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:23.700" style="s2">Moore&#39;s Law face of the tap engine looks</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.700" end="00:04:25.200" style="s2">like right with me on this yeah you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.700" end="00:04:26.670" style="s2">actually start getting a genuine just</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.200" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">the same way the ELA must look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.670" end="00:04:30.660" style="s2">at the battery and the Moore&#39;s law sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:32.490" style="s2">of capitalism&#39;s thing you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.660" end="00:04:37.140" style="s2">get a similar invisibility okay so we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.490" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">went from matter to life to behavior to</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.140" end="00:04:42.350" style="s2">culture and each one is a series of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:46.200" style="s2">moves in this in this in this tap</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.350" end="00:04:47.550" style="s2">Moore&#39;s law right and and we can now</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.200" end="00:04:50.850" style="s2">think about how do we actually design a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.550" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">tap engine that moves us along that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.850" end="00:04:56.090" style="s2">particular Moore&#39;s Law and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:58.860" style="s2">the generator functions of hard obsidium</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.090" end="00:05:02.310" style="s2">Wow that&#39;s very cool</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.860" end="00:05:03.830" style="s2">that&#39;s very cool I like that so you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.310" end="00:05:07.260" style="s2">that Greg and I have been in constant</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.830" end="00:05:11.100" style="s2">dialogue as well right you need to that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.260" end="00:05:13.230" style="s2">yes exactly because he&#39;s he and I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.100" end="00:05:14.850" style="s2">been doing two things we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.230" end="00:05:17.160" style="s2">integrating sort of theory of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.850" end="00:05:19.350" style="s2">with relevance realization theory which</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.160" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">he sees as the two are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.350" end="00:05:26.640" style="s2">interpenetrating and that thing you just</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:29.010" style="s2">described that art is of course it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.640" end="00:05:31.860" style="s2">metaphysical extension of in Thompson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.010" end="00:05:33.570" style="s2">idea of deep continuity in cognition all</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.860" end="00:05:36.030" style="s2">the way down and all the way up vision</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.570" end="00:05:37.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s the that&#39;s a connection that</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.030" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">Greg sees between theory of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.530" end="00:05:42.900" style="s2">and relevance realization and deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:44.340" style="s2">continuity and then Greg and I are now</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.900" end="00:05:47.420" style="s2">actually doing a series together we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.340" end="00:05:49.830" style="s2">actually filmed a couple of episodes</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.420" end="00:05:51.620" style="s2">where we are doing what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.830" end="00:05:54.450" style="s2">untangling the world not of</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.620" end="00:05:57.540" style="s2">consciousness the hard problems of mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.450" end="00:05:59.820" style="s2">and meaning we&#39;re going through an</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.540" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">extensive argument I built about trying</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.820" end="00:06:03.000" style="s2">to get naturalistic account of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.390" style="s2">consciousness and you can see how that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.000" end="00:06:11.070" style="s2">then plugs into his tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.390" end="00:06:13.560" style="s2">model as well so it might be a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.070" end="00:06:16.410" style="s2">if the three of us actually spoke at</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.560" end="00:06:18.570" style="s2">some time I think it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.410" end="00:06:21.570" style="s2">the next step the next definitely but</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.570" end="00:06:23.730" style="s2">you get to three of us and I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.570" end="00:06:25.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just ready</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.730" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">yet but I definitely see somebody like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.680" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">Zach Stein as being in that next wave</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:33.540" style="s2">and maybe maybe Chris like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:34.890" style="s2">something there yes I mean yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.540" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">exact and I just filmed another</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.890" end="00:06:40.020" style="s2">conversation with Andrew Sweeney so Zach</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:41.819" style="s2">and I have also built up very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.020" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">momentum we&#39;ve gotten into a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.819" end="00:06:47.150" style="s2">about the meta political which i think</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:49.800" style="s2">is a very interesting discussion that</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.150" end="00:06:53.190" style="s2">doc and I are having and and that</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.800" end="00:06:55.050" style="s2">strikes me as part of what the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.190" end="00:06:57.780" style="s2">side of the city and is also trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.050" end="00:06:59.550" style="s2">address so again it shouldn&#39;t work a</p>

<p begin="00:06:59.550" end="00:07:03.990" style="s2">thank you something I&#39;m sorry I cure the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.099" end="00:07:06.569" style="s2">dawn did a meaning wave arounds steal</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.990" end="00:07:09.120" style="s2">the culture and then he and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.569" end="00:07:11.729" style="s2">discussion on the snow about it and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.120" end="00:07:14.190" style="s2">mentioned your work on the Scythian in</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.729" end="00:07:17.490" style="s2">that discussion so I&#39;ll have to see that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.190" end="00:07:18.930" style="s2">meaning lake yeah yeah he&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.490" end="00:07:21.509" style="s2">interesting character in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.930" end="00:07:23.729" style="s2">story yeah very much it was it was it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.509" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">was a pleasure and talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.729" end="00:07:27.419" style="s2">whole notion was really cool</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:29.310" style="s2">because I thought that I presented the</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.419" end="00:07:31.800" style="s2">argument that I think there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.310" end="00:07:34.889" style="s2">consonants between the project of trying</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">to steal the culture and the project of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.889" end="00:07:39.210" style="s2">trying to bring about something like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:41.069" style="s2">sibian I think those two are deeply</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.210" end="00:07:43.650" style="s2">connect well okay so having having</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.069" end="00:07:45.000" style="s2">having not wash that dialogue let me</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.650" end="00:07:49.229" style="s2">throw some things in there so that first</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.000" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">I guess maybe I&#39;m kind of loading my a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.229" end="00:07:54.750" style="s2">cure the dawn like simulator so playful</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:57.029" style="s2">words so you know the color I was like</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.750" end="00:08:00.569" style="s2">yeah like steal the coach like to stew</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.029" end="00:08:04.380" style="s2">to make the culture stronger to Neal</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.569" end="00:08:05.639" style="s2">culture and and so there so here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.380" end="00:08:07.770" style="s2">visual image this is the pin that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.639" end="00:08:09.270" style="s2">keeps popping into my head well probably</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.770" end="00:08:11.759" style="s2">should I&#39;ll try the visual image I just</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.270" end="00:08:20.370" style="s2">got even more visual in my conversation</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.759" end="00:08:25.590" style="s2">it&#39;s Greg it&#39;s like okay so we have the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.370" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">example of the discovery in complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.590" end="00:08:30.860" style="s2">chemistry space the very specific</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.890" end="00:08:42.479" style="s2">cell membranes so there&#39;s some some some</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:44.820" style="s2">specific very specific architecture that</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.479" end="00:08:46.260" style="s2">includes these aspects of complex</p>

<p begin="00:09:06.180" end="00:09:10.110" style="s2">right that look so this is the</p>

<p begin="00:09:16.350" end="00:09:23.070" style="s2">I mean with the idea that it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.010" end="00:09:27.180" style="s2">happening is ultimately they reinvent</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.070" end="00:09:30.420" style="s2">you of the of Aristotle&#39;s notions which</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.180" end="00:09:31.740" style="s2">i think is right and so people in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.420" end="00:09:34.710" style="s2">philosophy of biology are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.740" end="00:09:36.660" style="s2">this in terms of closure of constraints</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.710" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">not only do you have constraints closing</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.660" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">feedback cite both in life you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:42.510" style="s2">constraints through that form a</p>

<p begin="00:09:42.510" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">other they&#39;re all me so the constraints</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.980" end="00:09:48.210" style="s2">are not only downward against not only</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.530" style="s2">constraining the feedbacks like those</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.210" end="00:09:51.840" style="s2">the constraints are also locked together</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.530" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">in becoming mutually interdependent with</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.840" end="00:09:56.610" style="s2">each other exactly exactly exactly yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:09:58.200" style="s2">when I said architecture that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.610" end="00:10:02.820" style="s2">referring to as that notion of the the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.200" end="00:10:05.880" style="s2">inter locking mesh of constraints that</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.820" end="00:10:08.160" style="s2">hold it straight complex into a into</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.880" end="00:10:10.410" style="s2">something like any of that and that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.160" end="00:10:12.180" style="s2">that&#39;s powerful language because when</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.410" end="00:10:14.160" style="s2">you move to the talking about that kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.180" end="00:10:16.770" style="s2">of architecture of constraints you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.160" end="00:10:19.050" style="s2">see why it makes accessible you Jason</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.770" end="00:10:21.470" style="s2">possible because constraints are exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.050" end="00:10:24.780" style="s2">the shaping of possibility right and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.470" end="00:10:27.840" style="s2">that gives you sort of a more clearer</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.780" end="00:10:30.660" style="s2">explanation of why it moves while you</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.840" end="00:10:32.100" style="s2">get that change in chef yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.660" end="00:10:33.840" style="s2">exactly okay so cool so take that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.100" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">particularly anybody happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.840" end="00:10:41.630" style="s2">holding that very clearly and then apply</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:43.800" style="s2">that to culture space yes so true to -</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.630" end="00:10:49.110" style="s2">mr. Truman is using recapture the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.800" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">culture Oh steal the culture yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.110" end="00:10:53.990" style="s2">term I used a moment ago was reinvent oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:56.670" style="s2">I picked up on the Latin word invent EO</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.990" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">from carries book because inventio means</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.670" end="00:11:02.070" style="s2">it falls between two words that we put</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">in opposition it means both to discover</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.070" end="00:11:07.860" style="s2">and to make inventio yes yes there we go</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.860" end="00:11:12.060" style="s2">yeah so so so the the the if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:14.550" style="s2">sort of compared those two what happens</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.060" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">is or a way of saying what what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.550" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">saying in this in this other language is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:25.019" style="s2">to discover and or invent inventio the</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:28.589" style="s2">set of downward and interoperating</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.019" end="00:11:33.390" style="s2">constraints that select from culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.589" end="00:11:37.560" style="s2">space that particular precise culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.390" end="00:11:41.190" style="s2">that is the moral equivalent of DNA RNA</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.560" end="00:11:43.769" style="s2">and cell membranes I hope that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.190" end="00:11:45.870" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying that I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.769" end="00:11:48.329" style="s2">analogy I was using when I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.870" end="00:11:49.649" style="s2">to a hero and that actually came from an</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.329" end="00:11:52.680" style="s2">earlier thing I said when I was on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.649" end="00:11:54.990" style="s2">snow I answered the question the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.680" end="00:11:58.079" style="s2">I use is the way Christianity stole the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.990" end="00:12:01.470" style="s2">culture that it wasn&#39;t a political</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.079" end="00:12:03.839" style="s2">revolution attempting to overturn the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.470" end="00:12:06.600" style="s2">regime what it was was a bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.839" end="00:12:08.670" style="s2">creation of an alternative culture that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.600" end="00:12:10.529" style="s2">event shuri right that is largely</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.670" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">ignored and then oppressed but then</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.529" end="00:12:15.149" style="s2">eventually basically becomes the basis</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:18.329" style="s2">of a new civilization in the medieval</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.149" end="00:12:20.310" style="s2">period and that&#39;s what I mean about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.329" end="00:12:23.490" style="s2">I what I&#39;m what I&#39;m trying to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.310" end="00:12:27.000" style="s2">with my work yeah great exactly so you</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.490" end="00:12:28.380" style="s2">can say is there&#39;s something that is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.000" end="00:12:30.180" style="s2">gonna use the term generator function</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.380" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">probably not very well but I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.180" end="00:12:34.680" style="s2">represent the selection or the set of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:37.470" style="s2">constraints in the movie we were just</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.680" end="00:12:40.560" style="s2">describing it which is as meta to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.470" end="00:12:43.800" style="s2">actually transcend into the actuals of</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.560" end="00:12:45.810" style="s2">the given culture yes exactly exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.800" end="00:12:47.910" style="s2">Christianity operates as a new</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.810" end="00:12:50.579" style="s2">transcendent a new generator function in</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.910" end="00:12:53.730" style="s2">culture space that&#39;s selected from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.579" end="00:12:55.949" style="s2">milieu that was available in Rome which</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.730" end="00:12:57.510" style="s2">of course is very large rich / rich</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.949" end="00:13:00.750" style="s2">because an adjacent possible is actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.510" end="00:13:03.149" style="s2">over overwhelmingly large selects a</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.750" end="00:13:05.130" style="s2">particular subset of that into what then</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.149" end="00:13:07.560" style="s2">becomes a culture that has</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.130" end="00:13:09.209" style="s2">characteristics that are more adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.560" end="00:13:12.390" style="s2">in the context of the decline of Rome</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.209" end="00:13:14.640" style="s2">yes and they make possible new ways of</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.390" end="00:13:16.500" style="s2">being I mean some carries book where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.640" end="00:13:18.810" style="s2">got the term inventio from basically</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.500" end="00:13:21.250" style="s2">argues that Augustine crafts our notion</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.810" end="00:13:22.629" style="s2">of the interior self</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.250" end="00:13:25.980" style="s2">and of course you get Christian the</p>

<p begin="00:13:25.980" end="00:13:31.240" style="s2">and all kinds of new ways of being and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.589" end="00:13:34.540" style="s2">these have huge cultural consequences</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.240" end="00:13:36.759" style="s2">and socio-political consequences this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.540" end="00:13:39.220" style="s2">part of Tom Hollands argument right that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.759" end="00:13:42.220" style="s2">you know Christianity makes infanticide</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.220" end="00:13:45.519" style="s2">a moral crime whereas previously</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.220" end="00:13:48.220" style="s2">infanticide is an accepted practice we</p>

<p begin="00:13:50.170" end="00:13:54.459" style="s2">of option for us we can imagine it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.389" end="00:13:55.720" style="s2">infer it but it would be like but for</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.459" end="00:13:57.699" style="s2">none of us do we could we bring</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:14:01.740" style="s2">ourselves to get to that state of</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.769" end="00:14:10.629" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.199" end="00:14:12.370" style="s2">hearing when you&#39;re saying how it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:12.370" end="00:14:18.759" style="s2">possible I&#39;m connecting that to</p>

<p begin="00:14:23.829" end="00:14:28.680" style="s2">the actual cognitive move that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.990" end="00:14:31.930" style="s2">happening what we&#39;re talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.680" end="00:14:36.279" style="s2">yeah okay so what I&#39;m seeing there is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.930" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">something like I guess it looks a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.279" end="00:14:39.610" style="s2">bit like a rhizome a little bit like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:44.019" style="s2">kind of a branching or capillary system</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.610" end="00:14:47.319" style="s2">right and they&#39;re they growing towards</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.019" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">or becoming more adjacent to and then a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.319" end="00:14:52.720" style="s2">critical energy so I&#39;ve got a person and</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:55.389" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a location in culture space and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.720" end="00:14:58.089" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a distance that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.389" end="00:15:01.209" style="s2">ready willing and able to go right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.089" end="00:15:06.579" style="s2">as as the rhizome as the capillary</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.209" end="00:15:08.579" style="s2">structure of of culture branches until</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.579" end="00:15:10.629" style="s2">it gets within that critical distance</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.579" end="00:15:12.519" style="s2">then they will migrate right they will</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.629" end="00:15:15.910" style="s2">make the move to get on to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.519" end="00:15:18.189" style="s2">particular branch and I would make it a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.910" end="00:15:19.089" style="s2">little bit more biological in that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.189" end="00:15:22.120" style="s2">would make it more like each</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.089" end="00:15:25.959" style="s2">construction that right there moving is</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.120" end="00:15:27.759" style="s2">also helping to draw right right like</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.959" end="00:15:30.220" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the organism</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.759" end="00:15:33.189" style="s2">environment each construction model I</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.220" end="00:15:33.880" style="s2">think that&#39;s so I see yeah that people</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.189" end="00:15:34.750" style="s2">are doing it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.880" end="00:15:37.480" style="s2">niche construct</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.750" end="00:15:39.370" style="s2">the way in which that sort of evolves</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.480" end="00:15:40.780" style="s2">into existence right and so this is like</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.370" end="00:15:41.860" style="s2">this is the this is South we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.780" end="00:15:44.260" style="s2">describing here sort of the meta</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.860" end="00:15:45.940" style="s2">constraint on the generator function</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.260" end="00:15:48.280" style="s2">right and any viable generative fraction</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.940" end="00:15:50.080" style="s2">has to look like that and then we apply</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.280" end="00:15:52.540" style="s2">the this is doing the stuff you and Greg</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.080" end="00:15:53.710" style="s2">are sort of the reason why you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.540" end="00:15:56.800" style="s2">right people would be doing this is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.710" end="00:15:59.710" style="s2">we then apply the our best understanding</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.800" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">of the actual context yes where are the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.710" end="00:16:05.500" style="s2">actual designs of cultural milieu that</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">are highly in alignment with the best</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.500" end="00:16:12.280" style="s2">ways for people to you know feel seen</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.720" style="s2">and to activate their highest potential</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.280" end="00:16:14.500" style="s2">all that other kinds of stuff right if</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.720" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.500" end="00:16:20.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what about if you say that any</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:25.030" style="s2">any culture we&#39;re simultaneously any</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.410" end="00:16:27.010" style="s2">person will feel like they are more well</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.030" end="00:16:28.270" style="s2">met they&#39;re living their well-being is</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.010" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">going they feel like they&#39;re mobbing is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.270" end="00:16:33.360" style="s2">going up by participating in it and it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.100" style="s2">is so designed that their participation</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.360" end="00:16:38.080" style="s2">increases the global capacity of that</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.100" end="00:16:40.780" style="s2">culture to up gradient the well-being of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.080" end="00:16:43.120" style="s2">every member of that culture that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.780" end="00:16:44.260" style="s2">of mathematically the hard part is doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.120" end="00:16:47.650" style="s2">it but mathematically that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.260" end="00:16:49.750" style="s2">looking to do and back just to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.650" end="00:16:52.510" style="s2">find it and the point or the proposition</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.750" end="00:16:55.240" style="s2">is is that that language and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.510" end="00:16:57.730" style="s2">language of the portal pathway or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.240" end="00:16:59.470" style="s2">cell membrane DNA are in a location</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.730" end="00:17:02.050" style="s2">precise location and culture space like</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.470" end="00:17:03.040" style="s2">those are the same yes there are two</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.050" end="00:17:06.490" style="s2">different ways of talking about the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.040" end="00:17:09.189" style="s2">kind of thing so I like all of that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.490" end="00:17:10.600" style="s2">look but I have a potential addendum or</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.189" end="00:17:14.020" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re saying this and I just</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.600" end="00:17:16.150" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen seen it imply I think what</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.020" end="00:17:18.520" style="s2">happens in these transitions is not only</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.150" end="00:17:21.370" style="s2">and and maybe you mean this by upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.520" end="00:17:23.050" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a qualitative change I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.370" end="00:17:24.790" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s not just a quantity the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.050" end="00:17:26.230" style="s2">quantitative change in well-being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.790" end="00:17:28.240" style="s2">not like the Christians felt like they</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.230" end="00:17:31.330" style="s2">had with the Roman elite had but just</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.240" end="00:17:32.800" style="s2">more they&#39;ve got the field of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.330" end="00:17:35.890" style="s2">existence and experience had been</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.800" end="00:17:38.500" style="s2">widened qualitatively not just a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.890" end="00:17:39.730" style="s2">quantitative expansion yeah yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.500" end="00:17:41.170" style="s2">let&#39;s hit this tone I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.730" end="00:17:42.870" style="s2">actually done this yet out loud so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.170" end="00:17:46.720" style="s2">just this is great to have this here so</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.870" end="00:17:48.440" style="s2">tyson yoko puerta the san talk i</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.720" end="00:17:50.059" style="s2">recommend his book recently</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.440" end="00:17:52.490" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna be referencing his stuff a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.059" end="00:17:53.720" style="s2">lot and I imagine that at some point not</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.490" end="00:17:55.639" style="s2">too long from now we&#39;ll also be getting</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.720" end="00:17:56.899" style="s2">into relationship but he makes a really</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.639" end="00:17:58.549" style="s2">good distinction from an indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.899" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">knowing respect but very good</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.549" end="00:18:01.850" style="s2">distinction between growth and increase</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:04.190" style="s2">right talk about in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.850" end="00:18:08.000" style="s2">economics but for example if I want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:09.230" style="s2">get smarter I mean a broad brush I want</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.000" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">to get to the details I want to get to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.230" end="00:18:13.309" style="s2">smarter I&#39;ve got basically two basic</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">approaches I can either grow the node</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.309" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">the size of my brain I can add more</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:18.500" style="s2">neurons just get a bigger brain and</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:20.299" style="s2">that&#39;s a little bit like saying I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.500" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">gonna grow GDP I&#39;m just gonna kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.299" end="00:18:24.679" style="s2">add more piles of gold to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:28.879" style="s2">pieces of gold to the pile of gold that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.679" end="00:18:32.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve got or I can I can increase the</p>

<p begin="00:18:32.750" end="00:18:37.610" style="s2">can increase the quality of synaptic and</p>

<p begin="00:18:37.610" end="00:18:44.389" style="s2">pointers is high his proposition is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.659" end="00:18:47.419" style="s2">broadly speaking civilization or more</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.389" end="00:18:50.419" style="s2">narrowly capitalism has a growth model</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.419" end="00:18:53.480" style="s2">it wants to just add more neurons yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.419" end="00:18:54.919" style="s2">where the indigenous approach and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.480" end="00:18:56.120" style="s2">will just preserve the pose the approach</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.919" end="00:18:58.429" style="s2">that you were just describing in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.120" end="00:19:01.519" style="s2">context of the right answer to culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.429" end="00:19:03.379" style="s2">space is this increased approach yes and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.519" end="00:19:05.870" style="s2">that&#39;s what was central and Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.379" end="00:19:08.269" style="s2">right an animal is not just more of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.870" end="00:19:10.399" style="s2">plant and animal can do things it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:32.240" end="00:20:37.220" style="s2">actually have and in that context there</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.610" end="00:20:39.559" style="s2">seems to be three primary variables one</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.190" end="00:21:02.080" style="s2">large possibilities because of just our</p>

<p begin="00:21:02.080" end="00:21:06.679" style="s2">then in some sense there&#39;s the how which</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.640" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">is to say what is our capacity as</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.679" end="00:21:10.190" style="s2">individuals in all the ways like our</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.720" end="00:21:28.610" style="s2">consistently work toward generating a</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.070" end="00:29:47.460" style="s2">opportunity right now to do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:50.130" style="s2">of clarification because I know that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.460" end="00:29:51.330" style="s2">the languaging of religion and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.130" end="00:29:54.740" style="s2">languaging the religion is not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.330" end="00:29:57.990" style="s2">religion is oftentimes confusing yes and</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.740" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s kind of hyper confusing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.990" end="00:30:03.540" style="s2">because we live at the tail end of a war</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:06.660" style="s2">where science declared rhetorical war on</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.540" end="00:30:09.530" style="s2">on religion because I had to and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.660" end="00:30:12.360" style="s2">kind of smeared and confused the name so</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.530" end="00:30:14.880" style="s2">what I believe we mean by the reference</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.360" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">to the term religion is a little is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.880" end="00:30:22.380" style="s2">much like this this metaphor of DNA RNA</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">and some membrane but that&#39;s my point</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.380" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">what religion means is going to go</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:30.030" style="s2">through that kind of shift like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:32.550" style="s2">going to be qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.030" end="00:30:35.280" style="s2">right probably maybe different exactly</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.550" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">right but if you compare religion after</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.280" end="00:30:38.760" style="s2">yet to revolution to religion before</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:41.460" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.760" end="00:30:43.170" style="s2">like new proposition it&#39;s the me the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.460" end="00:30:45.690" style="s2">very meaning of what it was and what</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.170" end="00:30:47.580" style="s2">wisdom is and what meaning like oh and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.690" end="00:30:49.410" style="s2">they eat what the transcendent if all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.580" end="00:30:50.910" style="s2">that had undergone a fundamental change</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.410" end="00:30:52.980" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about right</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.910" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">exactly so when we talk about what this</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.980" end="00:30:57.510" style="s2">is other than this next thing looks like</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:59.010" style="s2">we have to become super abstract to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.510" end="00:31:00.870" style="s2">able to say okay is there a continuity</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.010" end="00:31:02.940" style="s2">if there is there a company there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.870" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">transformation there&#39;s change is there</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.940" end="00:31:05.970" style="s2">any sense of continuity that allows us</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.620" style="s2">to use the same word to refer to them at</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.970" end="00:31:08.760" style="s2">all or something using a different word</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.620" end="00:31:09.630" style="s2">and I believe there is actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.760" end="00:31:12.120" style="s2">continuity but</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.630" end="00:31:15.090" style="s2">it was something like some interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.120" end="00:31:19.200" style="s2">intermesh set of constraints I think so</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.090" end="00:31:20.880" style="s2">I mean I mean so Evans take on an update</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.200" end="00:31:23.340" style="s2">of Aristotle is called the deep</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.880" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">continuity hypothesis and it&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.340" end="00:31:32.940" style="s2">that there you know that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:34.650" style="s2">well first I&#39;ll say how I think he takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.940" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">it and then my interpretation of it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.650" end="00:31:37.830" style="s2">I don&#39;t want those confuse because he</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">might not agree with the second thing so</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.830" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">the point about deep continuity from</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:42.900" style="s2">Aristotle is you know it&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:45.120" style="s2">not a ladder</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.900" end="00:31:47.400" style="s2">the animal doesn&#39;t leave all of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.120" end="00:31:50.670" style="s2">principles and patterns of the plant</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.400" end="00:31:52.440" style="s2">behind right but it builds on them and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.670" end="00:31:54.510" style="s2">this is your DNA metaphor it scaffolds</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.440" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">on them right new machinery that allows</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.510" end="00:32:00.300" style="s2">new things and so how Evans sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:01.710" style="s2">tends to present it is you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.300" end="00:32:03.540" style="s2">both identity and difference when we</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.710" end="00:32:05.430" style="s2">talk about deep continuity and both are</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.540" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">important the way I&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.430" end="00:32:08.340" style="s2">understand that is with the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.800" style="s2">metaphor of exaptation</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.340" end="00:32:12.930" style="s2">because in upset patient it&#39;s not like I</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.800" end="00:32:15.390" style="s2">sew my tongue there&#39;s continuity between</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.930" end="00:32:17.280" style="s2">the tongue that masticates and tastes</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.390" end="00:32:19.250" style="s2">and the tongue that speaks but that</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.280" end="00:32:22.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean the taste and speech are</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.250" end="00:32:26.070" style="s2">identical and so that that and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.560" end="00:32:28.740" style="s2">think my whole my theoretical hope is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.070" end="00:32:31.410" style="s2">that in this one&#39;s I think what Greg and</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.740" end="00:32:32.760" style="s2">I are groping towards is that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.410" end="00:32:35.370" style="s2">machinery of things like relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.760" end="00:32:36.570" style="s2">realization and religio is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.370" end="00:32:39.060" style="s2">that&#39;s going to go through some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.570" end="00:32:43.700" style="s2">excitation in there yeah exactly so</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.060" end="00:32:46.020" style="s2">perfect so it&#39;s almost like a mmm I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.700" end="00:32:47.640" style="s2">don&#39;t see two sides of a coin or two</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.020" end="00:32:49.790" style="s2">sides of the mirror because there&#39;s -</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.640" end="00:32:53.310" style="s2">there&#39;s like a two side so the tongue</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.790" end="00:32:56.310" style="s2">the tongue that speaks must also be the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.310" end="00:32:58.620" style="s2">tongue that tastes yes yes dispense with</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.310" end="00:33:00.930" style="s2">the prior you you must maintain so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.620" end="00:33:03.150" style="s2">think like animals so animals and plants</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.930" end="00:33:05.910" style="s2">well there&#39;s a there needs to be some</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.150" end="00:33:07.820" style="s2">way of bringing in resources from the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.910" end="00:33:11.220" style="s2">outside there needs to be some way of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.820" end="00:33:13.020" style="s2">copying and high-fidelity replication of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.220" end="00:33:15.300" style="s2">the construct but there&#39;s a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.020" end="00:33:18.060" style="s2">things that are the same between plants</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.300" end="00:33:23.160" style="s2">and animals yes it will do as animals do</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.060" end="00:33:26.040" style="s2">two things right one is they satisfy the</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.160" end="00:33:27.660" style="s2">requirements that are that are the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.040" end="00:33:31.770" style="s2">shared requirements of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.660" end="00:33:35.430" style="s2">animals in a way right but then unlocks</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.770" end="00:33:37.200" style="s2">a whole new me whole new milieu all new</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.430" end="00:33:39.750" style="s2">possibility space which to say this they</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.200" end="00:33:41.880" style="s2">exact they they again you can say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.750" end="00:33:45.300" style="s2">it&#39;s funny animal is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.880" end="00:33:47.100" style="s2">particular solution to organism yes I</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.300" end="00:33:48.780" style="s2">know and it&#39;s a particular solution to</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.100" end="00:33:52.350" style="s2">organism which by the way is is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.780" end="00:33:54.210" style="s2">radically dependent on plant yeah as</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.350" end="00:33:56.910" style="s2">part of its input as part of his complex</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.210" end="00:33:59.550" style="s2">and by virtue of solving or the organism</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.910" end="00:34:01.470" style="s2">problem in a particular way unlocks this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.550" end="00:34:03.870" style="s2">exact of potential which is the new</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.470" end="00:34:06.660" style="s2">milieu yeah beautifully said beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.870" end="00:34:11.220" style="s2">said exactly what I wanted to convey so</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.660" end="00:34:14.130" style="s2">this thing / that&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.220" end="00:34:15.480" style="s2">our Fortran are trying to feel this</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.130" end="00:34:19.590" style="s2">feels very brew we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.480" end="00:34:21.120" style="s2">imbalance between them it has the same</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.590" end="00:34:22.770" style="s2">thing right on the one hand sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.120" end="00:34:25.950" style="s2">downward facing or inward facing your</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.770" end="00:34:27.600" style="s2">past facing it&#39;s a it&#39;s a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.950" end="00:34:31.500" style="s2">culture space and solution to religion</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.600" end="00:34:32.850" style="s2">space yeah that is sits alongside all</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.500" end="00:34:35.010" style="s2">the other solutions to culture and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.850" end="00:34:37.410" style="s2">religion space in a particular way but</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.010" end="00:34:39.060" style="s2">it does so in a fashion and probably by</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.410" end="00:34:42.780" style="s2">the way in a fashion which is dependent</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.060" end="00:34:45.450" style="s2">upon many other right yeah it unlocks a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.780" end="00:34:48.060" style="s2">new executive potential and then zapped</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.450" end="00:34:52.110" style="s2">of potential has a whole set of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.060" end="00:34:53.550" style="s2">qualities or affordances like from you</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.110" end="00:34:56.910" style="s2">know a dog eats but it is a dog does not</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.550" end="00:35:01.980" style="s2">does not sing it vocalising it does not</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.910" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">sing same thing right the curve crap you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.980" end="00:35:05.550" style="s2">know solve the problem of religion space</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.530" style="s2">but it opens up this new just new milieu</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.550" end="00:35:10.950" style="s2">and this milieu is one in which we</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.530" end="00:35:12.360" style="s2">currently can&#39;t we can&#39;t even we could</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.950" end="00:35:14.160" style="s2">just kind of point at it because my</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.360" end="00:35:15.960" style="s2">definition until it happens it ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.160" end="00:35:16.500" style="s2">happened and we can&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.960" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">be in there</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.500" end="00:35:22.860" style="s2">right I that was beautifully said what</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:25.830" style="s2">I&#39;m adding to that and I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.860" end="00:35:29.970" style="s2">you are to in practice is I feel a moral</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.830" end="00:35:32.790" style="s2">imperative to try and figure out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.970" end="00:35:35.370" style="s2">this is pragmatic like it&#39;s not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.790" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">facing a transformative experience in</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.370" end="00:35:37.980" style="s2">the LA Paul sense we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:42.420" style="s2">what its gonna be like until we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.980" end="00:35:44.400" style="s2">the other side again but you know but as</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.420" end="00:35:47.970" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued serious play is the best</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.400" end="00:35:51.349" style="s2">thing we have in the face of nation and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.970" end="00:35:53.580" style="s2">my moral imperative is how can I best</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.349" end="00:35:56.099" style="s2">facilitate the conditions of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.580" end="00:35:59.609" style="s2">serious play that have the most current</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.099" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">fallible plausibility that I will help</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.609" end="00:36:03.750" style="s2">to afford that acceptation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">talking about that&#39;s that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.750" end="00:36:06.780" style="s2">project I&#39;m really wrestling with right</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:10.410" style="s2">now mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.780" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s neat yeah and the word</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.410" end="00:36:15.060" style="s2">serious play you can I find myself</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">called to the play side yeah just say</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.060" end="00:36:19.260" style="s2">okay you know hey guys check this out</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:21.060" style="s2">like all the cool things you ever heard</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.260" end="00:36:23.670" style="s2">of or ever thought of or ever dreamed of</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.060" end="00:36:25.080" style="s2">every super cool thing that&#39;s everybody</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.670" end="00:36:29.430" style="s2">tractive in the entire history of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.080" end="00:36:30.540" style="s2">culture that is below the curve of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.430" end="00:36:38.010" style="s2">what&#39;s on the other side of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.540" end="00:36:42.920" style="s2">yeah so how do you do it so if you if</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.010" end="00:36:47.040" style="s2">you like we my thing about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.920" end="00:36:49.530" style="s2">the moral the combat like the you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.040" end="00:36:50.820" style="s2">the that sense of being called let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.530" end="00:36:56.820" style="s2">it that way that sense of being called</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.820" end="00:36:58.830" style="s2">to try and facilitate that that so what</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.820" end="00:37:01.460" style="s2">what does that what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.830" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">though sort of tactically do you think I</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.460" end="00:37:12.210" style="s2">say that again okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:12.750" style="s2">so we&#39;re we like so I don&#39;t wanna put</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.210" end="00:37:14.250" style="s2">words in your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.750" end="00:37:17.940" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just speak from right -</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.250" end="00:37:20.400" style="s2">perspective I see myself as right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.940" end="00:37:22.230" style="s2">when I use the word pragmatic I use it</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.400" end="00:37:24.630" style="s2">like in the you know in the James Ian</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.230" end="00:37:29.580" style="s2">you know I&#39;m using it in an effective</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.630" end="00:37:33.750" style="s2">logical sense right yeah so I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.580" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">my sort of pragmatic best to facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.750" end="00:37:39.180" style="s2">figure out the conditions of serious</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:45.450" style="s2">play that are most likely to afford</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.180" end="00:37:50.390" style="s2">people to exact without falling into the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.450" end="00:37:52.440" style="s2">usual trope of a utopia yeah okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.390" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">came for me as you were saying that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.440" end="00:37:59.070" style="s2">something like what does it feel like to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:02.490" style="s2">be called to singing when the tongue has</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.070" end="00:38:05.090" style="s2">yet only known taste right right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.490" end="00:38:09.180" style="s2">like that lab you&#39;ll experimentation of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.090" end="00:38:11.100" style="s2">the discovery of a like we&#39;re right next</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.180" end="00:38:13.950" style="s2">to singing this right we&#39;re almost like</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.100" end="00:38:16.140" style="s2">there&#39;s like this kind of experimental</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.950" end="00:38:17.640" style="s2">like lurching into and like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.140" end="00:38:19.500" style="s2">cracking and croaking like this</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.640" end="00:38:21.300" style="s2">coordination between the voice box and</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.500" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">the lungs and the lips and the tongue is</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.300" end="00:38:24.420" style="s2">funny actually new you watch the child</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:26.310" style="s2">learning how to whistle</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.420" end="00:38:28.080" style="s2">yeah like that right there&#39;s it ah</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.310" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">there&#39;s something there man I could</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.080" end="00:38:32.160" style="s2">fucking feel it it&#39;s almost but all I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:33.570" style="s2">can do is like sometimes pucker my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.160" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">and blow but it&#39;s not quite coming</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:38.250" style="s2">through yes that&#39;s the place right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:40.590" style="s2">it&#39;s important to recognize that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.250" end="00:38:43.100" style="s2">place you know check this shit out how</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.590" end="00:38:46.020" style="s2">does it a good metaphor utopianism is</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.100" end="00:38:54.240" style="s2">when a kid does this things like</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.020" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">three-year-old I just like I was</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.240" end="00:38:59.970" style="s2">whistling and then I hung that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:01.620" style="s2">utopianism utopianism is what happens</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.970" end="00:39:03.900" style="s2">when you fake it when you try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.620" end="00:39:05.610" style="s2">simulate the reality that we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.900" end="00:39:06.870" style="s2">sense it&#39;s right over there if we just</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.610" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">kind of get to all the right pieces</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.870" end="00:39:11.280" style="s2">together in the right way to generate</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">possibility that we can sense like we</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.280" end="00:39:15.900" style="s2">can sense that possibility in something</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:18.870" style="s2">like oh man it&#39;s just almost there</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.900" end="00:39:22.050" style="s2">and utopianism is faking it okay so one</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.870" end="00:39:25.550" style="s2">don&#39;t fake it don&#39;t don&#39;t pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.050" end="00:39:25.550" style="s2">you&#39;re doing something you&#39;re not doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.400" end="00:39:31.890" style="s2">yeah and recognize that there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.610" end="00:39:33.990" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s practice there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.890" end="00:39:35.400" style="s2">there&#39;s a practice and that practices</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.990" end="00:39:38.670" style="s2">this really interesting practice that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.400" end="00:39:41.910" style="s2">happens in a certain mode or it happens</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.670" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">motive of serious play yeah what one of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.910" end="00:39:47.130" style="s2">the things I actually did during the</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:50.700" style="s2">sort of the most quarantined period of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.130" end="00:39:53.550" style="s2">this this last few months was pick what</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.700" end="00:39:55.380" style="s2">are life skills that I have always been</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.550" end="00:39:56.700" style="s2">interested in getting that I never spent</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.380" end="00:39:58.920" style="s2">the time getting cuz I got time what am</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.700" end="00:40:01.980" style="s2">i I do so I focused on this whistle the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.920" end="00:40:03.600" style="s2">two fingers in mouth still not there so</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.980" end="00:40:03.990" style="s2">I can kind of do it and so I actually</p>

<p begin="00:40:03.990" end="00:40:07.650" style="s2">Zach experienced it like okay hold on</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.030" end="00:40:08.940" style="s2">like this and that that kind of expect</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.650" end="00:40:10.590" style="s2">you have to be the very experimental</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.940" end="00:40:13.080" style="s2">Millia to try different things and play</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.590" end="00:40:16.730" style="s2">that go forth and and and yet here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.080" end="00:40:16.730" style="s2">trick this is the thing that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.100" end="00:40:26.250" style="s2">like hammer on on steel the orienting</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.850" end="00:40:28.040" style="s2">basis of the subtle awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.250" end="00:40:30.150" style="s2">directionality towards getting it right</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.040" end="00:40:31.470" style="s2">yes well this supposed to worsen the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.150" end="00:40:33.810" style="s2">faith&#39;s not we&#39;ve been talking about I</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.470" end="00:40:35.970" style="s2">think yes yes so this was unify it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.810" end="00:40:38.550" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s the the thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.970" end="00:40:41.010" style="s2">searching inside the spaces of adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.550" end="00:40:43.470" style="s2">possible I think about just this problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.010" end="00:40:45.150" style="s2">how do i whistle you know all I did is</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.470" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">trying to do a combinatorial across all</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.150" end="00:40:48.570" style="s2">the different configurations available</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.240" style="s2">there no fucking way</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.570" end="00:40:55.290" style="s2">right you&#39;re the inner problem there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.240" end="00:40:58.440" style="s2">some way to to have access to a set of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.290" end="00:41:01.650" style="s2">constraints that radically radically</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.440" end="00:41:04.020" style="s2">constrained like 1 times 10 to the 120</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.650" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">constrain the configurations in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.020" end="00:41:08.010" style="s2">possibility space such that it actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:10.440" style="s2">is something that I can then begin to</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.010" end="00:41:11.609" style="s2">operate within and so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.440" end="00:41:13.350" style="s2">there right there&#39;s something like you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.609" end="00:41:14.790" style="s2">said there&#39;s some mode something that we</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.350" end="00:41:19.050" style="s2">have yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.790" end="00:41:20.220" style="s2">back that we can use to notice or do</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.050" end="00:41:22.350" style="s2">something around that constraint</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.220" end="00:41:24.180" style="s2">characteristic and then something that</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.350" end="00:41:25.350" style="s2">we have to be able to explore within the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.180" end="00:41:34.550" style="s2">boundaries of that constraint</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.350" end="00:41:34.550" style="s2">characteristic okay big too big</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.150" end="00:41:40.410" style="s2">hmm okay well there&#39;s let me go back you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.670" end="00:41:42.630" style="s2">you hit the nail you hit this now</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.410" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">probably more resoundingly than anybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.630" end="00:41:45.990" style="s2">I&#39;ve ever met which is well that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:49.170" style="s2">something is definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.990" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">propositional yes that something is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.170" end="00:41:54.359" style="s2">something that has to by definition take</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:56.250" style="s2">into account and take advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.359" end="00:41:57.869" style="s2">whole lineage of the universe from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.250" end="00:42:00.869" style="s2">beginning until the moment you were</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.869" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">right now it doesn&#39;t leverage all of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.869" end="00:42:04.200" style="s2">and the best of it it&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:06.570" style="s2">gonna get the job done yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.200" end="00:42:08.910" style="s2">so let&#39;s not take a narrow slice through</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.570" end="00:42:11.010" style="s2">like a particular subset of that hole</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.910" end="00:42:13.560" style="s2">that was super interesting in the 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.010" end="00:42:16.109" style="s2">and just do that let&#39;s actually really</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.560" end="00:42:17.490" style="s2">think about how we grasp the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.109" end="00:42:19.410" style="s2">reality as</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.490" end="00:42:21.600" style="s2">as we can and bring it to bear in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:25.110" style="s2">particular problem to me yes I agree</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.600" end="00:42:27.090" style="s2">with that totally ha this is where Greg</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.110" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">stuff gets extremely mystical very</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.090" end="00:42:31.260" style="s2">quickly what&#39;s he call like the Sun a la</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:34.110" style="s2">pintura something like that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.260" end="00:42:35.430" style="s2">but it&#39;s not a bad metaphor right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.110" end="00:42:36.980" style="s2">in some sense what we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.430" end="00:42:41.640" style="s2">about is that each of us then is a</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.980" end="00:42:44.310" style="s2">particular I worst singer aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.640" end="00:42:47.880" style="s2">whole and in continuity with that whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.310" end="00:42:52.410" style="s2">so there&#39;s a way in which this story of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.880" end="00:42:55.970" style="s2">the coordination or the coherence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.410" end="00:43:01.770" style="s2">this network this group of singular</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.970" end="00:43:03.230" style="s2">beings people is the whole which is to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.770" end="00:43:05.130" style="s2">say the whole of reality or at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.230" end="00:43:08.000" style="s2">quantum of the whole of reality to that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.130" end="00:43:12.119" style="s2">particular distributed cognition</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.000" end="00:43:15.570" style="s2">contains doing its thing right becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.119" end="00:43:17.880" style="s2">operant on itself I think that&#39;s right I</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.570" end="00:43:20.970" style="s2">mean and that&#39;s that could that in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.880" end="00:43:22.770" style="s2">sense completes that our STARTTLS model</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.970" end="00:43:25.109" style="s2">because what you get at the highest</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.770" end="00:43:26.250" style="s2">level for in his model human beings I</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.109" end="00:43:27.960" style="s2">mean the gods are above it but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.250" end="00:43:30.810" style="s2">not in they&#39;re not in there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.960" end="00:43:32.630" style="s2">in the analysis is at every previous</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.810" end="00:43:36.020" style="s2">level you have machinery of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.630" end="00:43:38.490" style="s2">actualization right so the plant</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.020" end="00:43:40.350" style="s2">actualizes a particular potential in</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.490" end="00:43:42.660" style="s2">organic manner that couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.350" end="00:43:44.670" style="s2">actualized before right and then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.660" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">animal actualized as a potential in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.670" end="00:43:50.070" style="s2">in in vegetative existence that couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:51.869" style="s2">be actualized before and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.070" end="00:43:53.700" style="s2">the right and then you get what you</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.869" end="00:43:55.800" style="s2">might call the cognitive agent that</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.700" end="00:43:57.840" style="s2">actualizes but then at the top of it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.800" end="00:44:02.490" style="s2">the rational agent and what the rational</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.840" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">agent does is they appropriate actual</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.490" end="00:44:06.630" style="s2">light that actualization as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:09.060" style="s2">self actualization the actualization</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.630" end="00:44:09.840" style="s2">process becomes recursively self</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.060" end="00:44:12.780" style="s2">actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.840" end="00:44:15.810" style="s2">in the rational being because i being is</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.780" end="00:44:17.790" style="s2">aware of all of the other and can bring</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.810" end="00:44:20.190" style="s2">that and can bring that into its</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.790" end="00:44:21.960" style="s2">processing in a way that a plant can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.190" end="00:44:24.630" style="s2">an animal can&#39;t or a merely cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.960" end="00:44:26.160" style="s2">being I can&#39;t exactly this is what that</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.630" end="00:44:27.750" style="s2">bending the curve right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.160" end="00:44:29.310" style="s2">the the deepest sense of that notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.750" end="00:44:31.410" style="s2">the singularity that folks have hit on</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.310" end="00:44:34.890" style="s2">yeah because once you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.410" end="00:44:38.309" style="s2">the capacity to utilize actualization to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.890" end="00:44:42.089" style="s2">increase the capacity to actualize yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.309" end="00:44:44.030" style="s2">looks like you know n is one either the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.089" end="00:44:47.160" style="s2">the exponent is anything super linear</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.030" end="00:44:49.609" style="s2">yeah anything superlinear then it goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.160" end="00:44:49.609" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.059" end="00:44:59.039" style="s2">another way of saying the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.440" end="00:45:01.220" style="s2">thing but important G&#39;s so so oh wait so</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.039" end="00:45:04.619" style="s2">so this is this is crucial so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.220" end="00:45:06.030" style="s2">just landed I just want me the animal</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.619" end="00:45:07.799" style="s2">does not dispense with the plant or the</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.030" end="00:45:09.960" style="s2">plant does not dispense with chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.799" end="00:45:12.390" style="s2">actually occur does not dispense with</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.960" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">social animals that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.390" end="00:45:16.289" style="s2">this threshold that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.880" style="s2">it does not dispense with culture does</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.289" end="00:45:20.069" style="s2">not dispense with humans it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.880" end="00:45:21.660" style="s2">animals there&#39;s no suspense right it</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.069" end="00:45:24.599" style="s2">actually the whole point is that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.660" end="00:45:26.940" style="s2">maintains the continuity integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.599" end="00:45:30.119" style="s2">that entire substrate that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.940" end="00:45:32.670" style="s2">that&#39;s right and that&#39;s why it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.119" end="00:45:34.920" style="s2">to think of it along the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.670" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">excitation rather than the metaphor of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.920" end="00:45:40.349" style="s2">revolution yes very nice very nice and</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:44.670" style="s2">this so judge turtle and we had this</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.349" end="00:45:48.410" style="s2">really beautiful story that has a</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.670" end="00:45:51.210" style="s2">characteristic of like when we arrived</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.410" end="00:45:54.630" style="s2">we arrived both at a location that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.210" end="00:45:58.410" style="s2">will acknowledge we will feel is fully</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.630" end="00:46:02.099" style="s2">harmonious with our highest senses it</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.410" end="00:46:05.430" style="s2">will seem it will feel and appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.099" end="00:46:07.619" style="s2">of both the highest value and the most</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.430" end="00:46:11.309" style="s2">highest truth of which we can be aware</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.619" end="00:46:12.539" style="s2">right it&#39;ll be awesome awesome it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.309" end="00:46:15.930" style="s2">awesome in the instead of the banal</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.539" end="00:46:18.329" style="s2">sense and then also right simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.930" end="00:46:20.700" style="s2">it will be awesome in in the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.329" end="00:46:23.220" style="s2">sense will open us up into a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.700" end="00:46:26.069" style="s2">gig about you know again about which we</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.220" end="00:46:28.349" style="s2">can say very little right now and it but</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.069" end="00:46:31.170" style="s2">but we can say that that the awesome in</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.349" end="00:46:33.119" style="s2">the deeper sense will always be self</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.170" end="00:46:35.700" style="s2">consciously aware crucially self</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.119" end="00:46:39.059" style="s2">consciously aware of the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.700" end="00:46:40.529" style="s2">its maintaining the integrity of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.059" end="00:46:42.980" style="s2">awesome in the more banal sense in</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.529" end="00:46:45.029" style="s2">perpetuity or these for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.980" end="00:46:47.119" style="s2">that&#39;s very good</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.029" end="00:46:51.689" style="s2">when you sit when you were saying that</p>

<p begin="00:46:51.689" end="00:46:57.089" style="s2">Corinthians at the end of the hymn -</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.059" end="00:47:00.329" style="s2">agape for now we see as in a mirror</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.089" end="00:47:01.949" style="s2">darkly but then we shall know even at we</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.329" end="00:47:02.429" style="s2">shall know fully even as we are fully</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.949" end="00:47:06.059" style="s2">known</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.429" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">he saw Christianity as exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.059" end="00:47:11.219" style="s2">serious play of agape and right now we</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:13.619" style="s2">only see in a mirror darkly but it will</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.219" end="00:47:15.539" style="s2">bring us somehow to the place where we</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.619" end="00:47:17.329" style="s2">will see fully even as we are fully</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.539" end="00:47:20.549" style="s2">known</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.329" end="00:47:25.169" style="s2">so that vision was actually part of his</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.549" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">way of understanding the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.169" end="00:47:32.729" style="s2">excitation that he was he dedicated his</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:34.829" style="s2">life to trying to bring about in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.729" end="00:47:36.659" style="s2">weird circle of my own autobiography I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.829" end="00:47:38.759" style="s2">feeling more and more affinity with st.</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.659" end="00:47:41.459" style="s2">Paul who was always a deeply ambivalent</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.759" end="00:47:43.079" style="s2">figure for me given my own particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.459" end="00:47:45.209" style="s2">religious upbringing but I now</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.079" end="00:47:47.249" style="s2">appreciate more what he was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.209" end="00:47:50.099" style="s2">articulate in fact that was perhaps the</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.249" end="00:47:51.719" style="s2">best thing to have said I think you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.099" end="00:47:53.759" style="s2">the wonderful him from agape which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.719" end="00:47:55.709" style="s2">the new way of being but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.759" end="00:47:58.949" style="s2">claim and now we&#39;re in Utopia in fact he</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.709" end="00:48:01.339" style="s2">says but now we see in a mirror darkly</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.949" end="00:48:05.130" style="s2">notice it&#39;s a reflection and its shadow</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.339" end="00:48:06.809" style="s2">but that bad act of constantly loving in</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.130" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">that way and looking in that mirror that</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.809" end="00:48:12.449" style="s2">reflection will actually bring us to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:14.309" style="s2">place we where we fully know even as we</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.449" end="00:48:16.529" style="s2">are fully knowing which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.309" end="00:48:18.269" style="s2">transductive way of putting this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.529" end="00:48:21.449" style="s2">thing I think you&#39;re talking about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.269" end="00:48:23.069" style="s2">just it&#39;s a similar kind of vision and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.449" end="00:48:24.599" style="s2">just thought that was a beautiful in it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.069" end="00:48:29.609" style="s2">bear well maybe the same vision as far</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.599" end="00:48:30.449" style="s2">as I can tell yeah maybe like like we</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.609" end="00:48:32.009" style="s2">talked about the mission that</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.449" end="00:48:34.949" style="s2">transcendent operator we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.009" end="00:48:38.549" style="s2">the notion of continuity it least seems</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.949" end="00:48:40.469" style="s2">plausible that there is a there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.549" end="00:48:44.699" style="s2">of a deep continuity I think I just</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.469" end="00:48:47.309" style="s2">copied the title with a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.699" end="00:48:49.429" style="s2">operator capital T yes very much</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.309" end="00:48:53.249" style="s2">and in which case it is the same vision</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.429" end="00:48:54.599" style="s2">yeah I think this goes towards the work</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.249" end="00:48:56.099" style="s2">Chris and Andrew and I have been doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.599" end="00:48:58.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a sort of the reinventing of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.099" end="00:48:59.970" style="s2">notion of soul as that which by now</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.440" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">we mediates between more nests and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.970" end="00:49:08.880" style="s2">suchness continuously and so yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:11.430" style="s2">the suchness is you know the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.880" end="00:49:13.140" style="s2">non categorical determinate miss of your</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.430" end="00:49:15.480" style="s2">being which of course is a product of</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.140" end="00:49:17.460" style="s2">all of your historicity and of all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.480" end="00:49:19.200" style="s2">the stacks from the participant from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.460" end="00:49:21.150" style="s2">inorganic all the way up through the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.200" end="00:49:22.920" style="s2">participatory all the way up but then</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.150" end="00:49:25.560" style="s2">the morning is exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.920" end="00:49:28.260" style="s2">talking about that relationship to right</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.560" end="00:49:31.170" style="s2">the indefinite possibility that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.260" end="00:49:34.680" style="s2">nevertheless not homogeneous ly</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.170" end="00:49:38.310" style="s2">indefinite it has some you know nascent</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.680" end="00:49:40.589" style="s2">structure that we by serious play we are</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.310" end="00:49:42.540" style="s2">affording its emerging intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.589" end="00:49:44.940" style="s2">to us that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do with</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.540" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">the the seeing in the mirror darkly kind</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.940" end="00:49:48.920" style="s2">of idea yeah so maybe just the last</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.010" end="00:49:51.180" style="s2">thing to put on this color noticing my</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.920" end="00:49:54.569" style="s2">I&#39;m definitely running out of energy I</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.180" end="00:49:56.640" style="s2">mean this has been great I&#39;m so glad to</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.569" end="00:49:58.230" style="s2">be able to get back into into the flow</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.640" end="00:50:01.160" style="s2">with you and I look forward to you me</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.230" end="00:50:04.140" style="s2">and Greg having a conversation yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.160" end="00:50:07.260" style="s2">getting I can I noticed that my health</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.140" end="00:50:09.829" style="s2">is up into the right I can cycles but</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.260" end="00:50:13.740" style="s2">it&#39;s up and to the right so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.829" end="00:50:15.900" style="s2">close I&#39;ll give you the last word but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.740" end="00:50:19.050" style="s2">also wanted to say I&#39;m also really</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.900" end="00:50:20.640" style="s2">enjoying this again with you yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.050" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">the thing that was coming into my mind I</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.640" end="00:50:24.410" style="s2">guess having this sort of movie play in</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:27.060" style="s2">the back of my mind as you&#39;re talking I</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.410" end="00:50:31.650" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve if you&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.060" end="00:50:33.390" style="s2">video that I did about Oceanics it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.650" end="00:50:35.700" style="s2">most recent Scythian video and you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.390" end="00:50:38.970" style="s2">just look at those units as a thing but</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.700" end="00:50:41.579" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a vision a very practical this</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.970" end="00:50:43.280" style="s2">is a key the point is practical it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.579" end="00:50:46.859" style="s2">vision of a way of living</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.280" end="00:50:49.079" style="s2">like literally hexagons floating on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.859" end="00:50:51.089" style="s2">ocean coordinating particular ways but</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.079" end="00:50:52.980" style="s2">you know at the engineering level having</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.089" end="00:50:55.589" style="s2">thought through a whole bunch of stops</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.980" end="00:50:57.660" style="s2">the ability to do like closed-loop water</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.589" end="00:51:00.150" style="s2">or closed-loop food clothes with energy</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.660" end="00:51:01.530" style="s2">production like a migration of a period</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.150" end="00:51:02.970" style="s2">of generations I don&#39;t mean human</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.530" end="00:51:04.380" style="s2">generations I mean in a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.970" end="00:51:06.630" style="s2">generations where they can actually</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.380" end="00:51:08.849" style="s2">begin to produce themselves without you</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.630" end="00:51:10.920" style="s2">know imports of foreign materials and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.849" end="00:51:11.859" style="s2">reducing extra nowness I could say very</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.920" end="00:51:16.029" style="s2">Pratt</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.859" end="00:51:19.539" style="s2">tickle imagination of a way of living</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.029" end="00:51:22.269" style="s2">that is well in some sense would feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.539" end="00:51:23.589" style="s2">pretty fucking utopian like a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.269" end="00:51:25.900" style="s2">better so let&#39;s just put a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.589" end="00:51:27.609" style="s2">better by no means even intending to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.900" end="00:51:31.210" style="s2">believe itself as being the end point</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.609" end="00:51:32.980" style="s2">but a step function like a whole step if</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.210" end="00:51:34.359" style="s2">you think about like 19th sand the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.980" end="00:51:37.299" style="s2">century way of living that we happen to</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.359" end="00:51:40.299" style="s2">the narrated sort of weird ramshackle</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.299" end="00:51:43.989" style="s2">glue elevators to cars and boom</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.299" end="00:51:47.739" style="s2">and try not to die too quickly it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.989" end="00:51:51.430" style="s2">a whole bunch better than that right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.739" end="00:51:52.509" style="s2">it&#39;s like right now we&#39;re those guys</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.430" end="00:51:54.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve been talking to them quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.509" end="00:51:55.720" style="s2">extensively they had the architectural</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.220" end="00:51:57.400" style="s2">design to get the system design any of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.720" end="00:51:59.079" style="s2">the mechanical design they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.400" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">conversations where the legal regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.079" end="00:52:04.239" style="s2">like brass tacks stuff about getting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:04.779" style="s2">capacity to build it now that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.239" end="00:52:07.930" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.779" end="00:52:10.200" style="s2">so practicality of that at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.930" end="00:52:13.539" style="s2">you might call ontological design</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.200" end="00:52:14.829" style="s2">architecture the physicality I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.539" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">we&#39;re a little bit behind the curve at</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.829" end="00:52:20.410" style="s2">the level of the cultural side but not</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:25.059" style="s2">radically trying to ramp it up with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.410" end="00:52:26.680" style="s2">whole deal logos dialectic project and</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.059" end="00:52:27.849" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s one of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.680" end="00:52:30.519" style="s2">things were it&#39;s a matter of four</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.849" end="00:52:32.410" style="s2">combinations it&#39;s mostly around finding</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.519" end="00:52:34.150" style="s2">the people we&#39;ve actually been holding</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.410" end="00:52:35.499" style="s2">the other pieces and then beginning to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.150" end="00:52:36.910" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got you got the core code</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.499" end="00:52:39.099" style="s2">alright the core code of how do we</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.910" end="00:52:41.289" style="s2">actually converse how do we connect how</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.099" end="00:52:43.029" style="s2">do we actually begin to frame it bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.289" end="00:52:44.920" style="s2">in the people and putting them in place</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.029" end="00:52:46.839" style="s2">and then that should be expanding sphere</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.920" end="00:52:47.769" style="s2">right it should be a network effect yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.839" end="00:52:48.970" style="s2">you&#39;re really good at getting the</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.769" end="00:52:51.819" style="s2">actuality out of it not just the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.970" end="00:52:53.349" style="s2">potential so so those are like we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.819" end="00:52:54.730" style="s2">this practicality we&#39;re on the threshold</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.349" end="00:52:56.289" style="s2">of actually being able to begin the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.730" end="00:52:57.579" style="s2">process of doing this thing I should</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.289" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">mention by the way that there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.579" end="00:53:00.999" style="s2">some really good work being done at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:02.950" style="s2">level of socio technology like what are</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.999" end="00:53:04.599" style="s2">the agreements and kind of fun things in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.950" end="00:53:08.950" style="s2">this weird transitionary period where</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.599" end="00:53:09.880" style="s2">money is a key a key gating at it but</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.950" end="00:53:13.660" style="s2">here&#39;s the flipside right</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.880" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2">the flip side is the urgency or the</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.660" end="00:53:19.809" style="s2">necessity of it was also quite present</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:22.509" style="s2">growing and growing and me just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.809" end="00:53:24.999" style="s2">like put a little bit of a well suppose</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.509" end="00:53:25.390" style="s2">to to so when Paul was writing certainly</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.999" end="00:53:27.100" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.390" end="00:53:29.350" style="s2">fall of room probably had a very felt</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.100" end="00:53:30.730" style="s2">sense like like yeah the old way</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.350" end="00:53:32.350" style="s2">definitely ain&#39;t sticking together like</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.730" end="00:53:34.750" style="s2">that there was a Visser allottee to it</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.350" end="00:53:36.040" style="s2">but they lacked the practicality and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.750" end="00:53:38.560" style="s2">ability to actually get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.040" end="00:53:44.080" style="s2">place was not they&#39;re not gonna get to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.560" end="00:53:46.570" style="s2">the moving in 880 but we now have booked</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.080" end="00:53:48.640" style="s2">we have the felt sense of the urgency</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.570" end="00:53:51.430" style="s2">and the thing we&#39;ve been standing on is</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.640" end="00:53:52.930" style="s2">sinking rapidly and on fire and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.430" end="00:53:55.720" style="s2">sharks and people are pulling it apart</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.930" end="00:53:57.190" style="s2">and fill-in-the-blank and and and by the</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.720" end="00:54:00.370" style="s2">way as you look around there&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.190" end="00:54:02.410" style="s2">a Western Europe and and Anatolia next</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.370" end="00:54:06.730" style="s2">to us right is everywhere you look the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.410" end="00:54:12.130" style="s2">whole thing&#39;s on fire yeah alright so</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.730" end="00:54:13.690" style="s2">that the urgency the fire the winch we</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.130" end="00:54:15.370" style="s2">may not have intentionally consciously</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.690" end="00:54:19.120" style="s2">chosen to set the ships on fire but the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.370" end="00:54:22.090" style="s2">ships are on fire and this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.120" end="00:54:23.830" style="s2">practicality that the the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.090" end="00:54:26.650" style="s2">reach up and grab that handhold and</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.830" end="00:54:30.040" style="s2">begin to pull ourselves up is proximal</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.650" end="00:54:31.780" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s there it&#39;s do us yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.040" end="00:54:34.480" style="s2">both of those that we are now as far as</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.780" end="00:54:36.730" style="s2">I know in a unique location I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.480" end="00:54:40.150" style="s2">quite confident in a unique location in</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.730" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">the sum total of all history had his</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.150" end="00:54:44.800" style="s2">characteristics and I want to say this</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:46.120" style="s2">in a super super like banal way but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.800" end="00:54:50.050" style="s2">found that it&#39;s been useful particularly</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.120" end="00:54:52.750" style="s2">in talking with boomers superficially</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.050" end="00:54:55.900" style="s2">this moment at the level of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.750" end="00:54:57.940" style="s2">politics resembles that period in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.900" end="00:55:01.390" style="s2">late 60s with which boomers were sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.940" end="00:55:04.270" style="s2">indelibly marked underground in Chicago</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.390" end="00:55:05.620" style="s2">riots and crap like that but even a</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.270" end="00:55:08.470" style="s2">little bit of fingernails scraping</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.620" end="00:55:11.260" style="s2">reckoner feels the odor of</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.470" end="00:55:17.680" style="s2">superficiality of it yeah yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.260" end="00:55:19.510" style="s2">example in 1967 1969 almost the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.680" end="00:55:23.020" style="s2">Western culture certainly the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.510" end="00:55:25.870" style="s2">American culture was solid yeah this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.020" end="00:55:28.060" style="s2">gigantic up upwelling of potential that</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.870" end="00:55:29.920" style="s2">still hadn&#39;t even begun to slow down in</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.060" end="00:55:31.690" style="s2">terms of its capacity to continue being</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.920" end="00:55:35.590" style="s2">what it was like this huge inertial moon</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.690" end="00:55:37.390" style="s2">and so while there was a breakdown going</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.590" end="00:55:39.430" style="s2">on and that breakdown was significant</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.390" end="00:55:41.200" style="s2">felt the level of race relationship</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.430" end="00:55:42.880" style="s2">level of gender relationships and level</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.200" end="00:55:45.309" style="s2">of culture in politics it was like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.880" end="00:55:48.040" style="s2">little surface it&#39;s like a you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.309" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">rocket ship entering into the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.040" end="00:55:53.079" style="s2">was a fire here but the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:56.260" style="s2">rocket ship is in integrity this ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.079" end="00:55:58.329" style="s2">been right now the whole thing is on</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.260" end="00:56:00.010" style="s2">fire all the way through pick any</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.329" end="00:56:02.220" style="s2">institution there is no institution that</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.010" end="00:56:06.000" style="s2">has a felt sense or a reality of</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.220" end="00:56:09.069" style="s2">strength of competence of integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.000" end="00:56:12.579" style="s2">resilience of duration but they all kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.069" end="00:56:14.920" style="s2">of feel like they&#39;re doomed soon so so</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.579" end="00:56:17.559" style="s2">on the one hand like things have not yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.920" end="00:56:20.589" style="s2">gotten as hot as they were at the peak</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.559" end="00:56:24.369" style="s2">of the 60s but we&#39;re now standing on</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.589" end="00:56:26.740" style="s2">stilts not on a pillar yeah as they tip</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.369" end="00:56:28.690" style="s2">over the consequences are vastly more</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.740" end="00:56:31.450" style="s2">impactful than they were back then so</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.690" end="00:56:33.670" style="s2">don&#39;t draw that metaphor or do draw the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.450" end="00:56:35.109" style="s2">metaphor then recognize that it&#39;s orders</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.670" end="00:56:36.880" style="s2">and orders and orders of magnitude worse</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.109" end="00:56:37.210" style="s2">and the metaphor would lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.880" end="00:56:40.089" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.210" end="00:56:41.140" style="s2">I agree thought right sorry I just felt</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.089" end="00:56:42.910" style="s2">like that was gonna be a useful way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.140" end="00:56:45.819" style="s2">just sort of connecting a few little</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.910" end="00:56:47.829" style="s2">tiny dots yes that&#39;s why the metaphors I</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.819" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">use are the you know the Bronze Age</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.829" end="00:56:54.609" style="s2">collapse the end of the Western Roman</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:57.940" style="s2">Empire those are the ones that I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.609" end="00:56:59.140" style="s2">and I even say this is even more radical</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.940" end="00:57:01.329" style="s2">than what you&#39;re saying I think that</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.140" end="00:57:03.520" style="s2">comparatively the French Revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.329" end="00:57:05.619" style="s2">only scratching the surface of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.520" end="00:57:07.660" style="s2">change in culture compared to the kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.619" end="00:57:10.780" style="s2">of change we&#39;re facing right now right</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.660" end="00:57:13.059" style="s2">now yes yeah right now exactly so we are</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.780" end="00:57:15.250" style="s2">simultaneously proximal to stuff that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.059" end="00:57:16.990" style="s2">can name like oh yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.250" end="00:57:18.819" style="s2">like the 60s it&#39;s like the French</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.990" end="00:57:20.140" style="s2">Revolution it&#39;s like the fall of Rome</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.819" end="00:57:21.339" style="s2">yeah those are things that we can name</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.140" end="00:57:23.740" style="s2">and some of us may actually have a felt</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.339" end="00:57:26.890" style="s2">sense of what that means which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.740" end="00:57:31.240" style="s2">right now like it&#39;s clearly proximal and</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.890" end="00:57:33.640" style="s2">a whole lot bigger yeah I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.240" end="00:57:36.970" style="s2">that which go gun a lot all right no I</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.640" end="00:57:39.099" style="s2">don&#39;t want to drain you just again this</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.970" end="00:57:41.680" style="s2">has been really good and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.099" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">should towards what you said earlier</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.680" end="00:57:44.859" style="s2">about you know getting the covers I</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">think getting the conversations going I</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.859" end="00:57:48.730" style="s2">think the three of us you you and Greg</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:50.589" style="s2">and I need to have a conversation or at</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.730" end="00:57:52.800" style="s2">least a few around all of this because I</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.589" end="00:57:54.810" style="s2">think there&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.800" end="00:57:56.400" style="s2">there&#39;s adjacent possibilities that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.810" end="00:58:00.690" style="s2">could very quickly actualize in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:02.220" style="s2">discussion I think exactly I meant okay</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.690" end="00:58:03.270" style="s2">well I&#39;ll be seeing you guys great</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.220" end="00:58:04.620" style="s2">tomorrow I&#39;ll talk to him about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.270" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">tomorrow okay great</p>
