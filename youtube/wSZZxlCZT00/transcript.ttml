<p begin="00:00:39.300" end="00:00:45.180" style="s2">them watching the series so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:50.120" style="s2">maybe we could follow up on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.180" end="00:00:53.309" style="s2">discussion that johannes and i had on</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.120" end="00:00:56.640" style="s2">Heidegger and the questions around</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.309" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">science technology and spirituality I I</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.640" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">think that would be a good place to</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">begin I&#39;ll pick up but and but guide we</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:09.420" style="s2">could also weave it together with</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:11.970" style="s2">perhaps you know the deal logos project</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.420" end="00:01:13.260" style="s2">broadly construed that I think those two</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.970" end="00:01:17.729" style="s2">should be brought into a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.260" end="00:01:19.770" style="s2">conversation with each other and so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.729" end="00:01:22.439" style="s2">think that would be a good place to pick</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.770" end="00:01:23.700" style="s2">up pick up and sort of weave together</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.439" end="00:01:26.369" style="s2">what do you guys think about that as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.700" end="00:01:28.770" style="s2">proposal for going forward that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.369" end="00:01:31.049" style="s2">great I could I could share to you some</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.770" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">of my thoughts about like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.049" end="00:01:37.650" style="s2">tensions or questions that are I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:40.490" style="s2">walking around with this a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.650" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">like one is I just I I would like to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.490" end="00:01:49.020" style="s2">on Piper&#39;s Heidegger&#39;s notion write</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:51.030" style="s2">about about the technological age and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.020" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">the history of being and they spent</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.030" end="00:01:56.689" style="s2">precisely the history of metaphysics in</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:02:00.149" style="s2">conversation with them with them in</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.689" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">nihilism and in combat in believing</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.149" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">crisis yes very much I think in seeing</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:07.229" style="s2">because in my mind done one level I</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">think about it I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.229" end="00:02:10.590" style="s2">I actually have a different if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">difference there but I&#39;m imagining</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.590" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">there&#39;s some key differences right but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:16.920" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:19.319" style="s2">love to get them talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.920" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">and just I would imagine they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.319" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">deeply inform one another in ways that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:26.970" style="s2">were would be really that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:29.849" style="s2">and I think you&#39;re honest I we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.970" end="00:02:32.610" style="s2">finish I don&#39;t think we actually caught</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.849" end="00:02:34.470" style="s2">around to the topic of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.610" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">thesis that the history of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.470" end="00:02:37.530" style="s2">is the history of nihilism I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:38.849" style="s2">we were just sort of broaching on it am</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.530" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">I am I remembering that correctly I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.849" end="00:02:44.250" style="s2">think that&#39;s about where we were and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:45.329" style="s2">we&#39;re just about to get onto that and of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.250" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">course the connection to the meeting</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.329" end="00:02:50.849" style="s2">crisis I think is is is pertinent and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">relevant I start off the whole section</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.849" end="00:02:55.680" style="s2">on the the prophets of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:03:02.700" style="s2">crisis with Heidegger because I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.680" end="00:03:05.640" style="s2">he&#39;s pivotal figure so yeah I I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.700" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">like to to talk about that and that goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.640" end="00:03:09.780" style="s2">towards sort of the broader topic that</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:12.299" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to explore you know and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.780" end="00:03:13.950" style="s2">and the new series I have Boyce&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.299" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">Rob a key because I&#39;m trying to get at</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.950" end="00:03:17.910" style="s2">you know this relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">science spirituality and the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.910" end="00:03:24.359" style="s2">crisis so that&#39;s that&#39;s one is getting</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">those talking to each other the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.359" end="00:03:31.459" style="s2">one is just kind of a tension I notice</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:32.970" style="s2">I&#39;m having in let&#39;s just come about and</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.459" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.970" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">it I was really I want one of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:40.680" style="s2">Johannes I really enjoyed your</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:44.459" style="s2">conversation with your last conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.680" end="00:03:47.819" style="s2">with your teacher about about nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.459" end="00:03:49.319" style="s2">yeah you would not oh yeah yeah excuse</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.819" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">me what was the name what was the name</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.319" end="00:03:57.030" style="s2">evil ditching out oh yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:04:00.269" style="s2">just I just really enjoy him a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:03.109" style="s2">like his rigor of thought but let his</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.269" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">few at the same time just a real unique</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.109" end="00:04:09.480" style="s2">being well but one of the things he</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:12.930" style="s2">talked about was the how do we you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.480" end="00:04:17.130" style="s2">you got that how do we respond to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.930" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">with all of being right and and what is</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.130" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">how do you respond to that and and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:25.260" style="s2">think one of the things I&#39;m I notice I</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">have a like a a wandering or attention</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.260" end="00:04:33.419" style="s2">when I listen to other people and when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">myself is on one level I see a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.419" end="00:04:41.669" style="s2">people so-called responding to it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">right however it seems to me that in</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.669" end="00:04:48.330" style="s2">some way the way that they&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:51.270" style="s2">about it demonstrates the very embodies</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.330" end="00:04:55.560" style="s2">the the in their response like furthers</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.270" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">the issue of Technology right kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.560" end="00:04:58.650" style="s2">like this notion of like turning the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:02.280" style="s2">world into a problem to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.650" end="00:05:04.199" style="s2">okay and just I just noticed like I I</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.280" end="00:05:07.830" style="s2">think I have this sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.199" end="00:05:10.349" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s talking about with the with</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.830" end="00:05:13.050" style="s2">temporality and like the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.349" end="00:05:15.470" style="s2">of being is that it&#39;s it&#39;s actually we</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.050" end="00:05:17.789" style="s2">are inside of it right</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.470" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">right there&#39;s a there&#39;s a quality of</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.789" end="00:05:22.650" style="s2">like that it&#39;s not under our direct</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">control and like that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.650" end="00:05:29.819" style="s2">in there about and given that right what</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.940" end="00:05:32.580" style="s2">is the authentic response being immortal</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.819" end="00:05:34.349" style="s2">right in being in touch with the actual</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.580" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">phenomena so that&#39;s like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.349" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">things that I&#39;m noticing is in and just</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.810" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">also thinking about it in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">the ecology of practices right right</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:50.789" style="s2">and and I and you&#39;re John you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:54.750" style="s2">you&#39;re my understanding of your repeated</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.789" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">insistence that not to imply an on to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.750" end="00:06:00.960" style="s2">theology right yes like it&#39;s about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">process of exercising the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.960" end="00:06:06.120" style="s2">directly and like we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:09.719" style="s2">assert we don&#39;t need to cert a being</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.120" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2">right or God or something but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.719" end="00:06:13.710" style="s2">mystery and in touchless that you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">get in it through the exercise of it</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.710" end="00:06:20.669" style="s2">right and I I think there&#39;s like deep</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:23.069" style="s2">parallels there but I dig irritated if</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.669" end="00:06:26.610" style="s2">people a lot when they talk about like</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.069" end="00:06:28.169" style="s2">this kind of mania of like it&#39;s up to us</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.610" end="00:06:30.539" style="s2">to fix the world or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.169" end="00:06:33.300" style="s2">you know and I there&#39;s a tension in</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.539" end="00:06:35.370" style="s2">there for me so I mean they don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.300" end="00:06:37.710" style="s2">allow me to a couple issues I want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.370" end="00:06:40.830" style="s2">frame and then maybe we&#39;ll let on us any</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.710" end="00:06:41.400" style="s2">issues he wants to frame so in</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.830" end="00:06:44.610" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.400" end="00:06:48.180" style="s2">with your second point I&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.610" end="00:06:52.470" style="s2">putting into a more Claire clear and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.180" end="00:06:55.919" style="s2">clarifying discussion relationship what</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.470" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">the ontological aspects the existential</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.919" end="00:07:01.650" style="s2">and the psychological aspects of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:03.449" style="s2">meeting crisis are and because in</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.650" end="00:07:06.690" style="s2">connection with that Kris and I have</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.449" end="00:07:09.030" style="s2">been working on an article for the side</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.690" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">view on the symptomology of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.030" end="00:07:12.870" style="s2">crisis and trying to develop that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:14.669" style="s2">then you know you probably know I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.870" end="00:07:16.830" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen this before you distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.669" end="00:07:19.800" style="s2">between sort of reactive responses and</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.830" end="00:07:21.000" style="s2">reflective responses and I think for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.800" end="00:07:23.130" style="s2">project that we&#39;re trying to do I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.000" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s adequate but that pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.130" end="00:07:28.250" style="s2">sits sort of the intersection that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:31.620" style="s2">needs to be teased though better between</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.250" end="00:07:32.820" style="s2">the cognitive and the existential but it</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.620" end="00:07:35.849" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get too much into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.820" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">ontological and I&#39;d like to get that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.849" end="00:07:39.210" style="s2">little bit clearer and that might be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:40.650" style="s2">way of going back to the first point of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.210" end="00:07:45.510" style="s2">clarifying the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.650" end="00:07:49.169" style="s2">meaning crisis and nihilism and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.510" end="00:07:50.789" style="s2">other point that came up was which was a</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.169" end="00:07:56.550" style="s2">point that you Honus and I were did talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.789" end="00:07:57.750" style="s2">about quite a bit which is you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.550" end="00:07:59.340" style="s2">struggling for a verb here but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.750" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">quite adequate but something like the</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.340" end="00:08:04.500" style="s2">Rican Sep xual ization but in a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:07.710" style="s2">profound way of sacredness and what does</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.500" end="00:08:10.320" style="s2">that mean for us now and what</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:13.740" style="s2">relationship does that have it to my</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.320" end="00:08:17.310" style="s2">first question is sacredness a category</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.740" end="00:08:18.900" style="s2">for example that cuts across the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.310" end="00:08:21.630" style="s2">cognitive the existential and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.900" end="00:08:24.330" style="s2">ontological is that precisely what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.630" end="00:08:26.370" style="s2">supposed to do for us and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.330" end="00:08:29.159" style="s2">trying to situate it within any one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.370" end="00:08:31.800" style="s2">those categories is a mistake but if it</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.159" end="00:08:34.349" style="s2">is trans categorical like that then</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.800" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">what&#39;s our appropriate way of of</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.349" end="00:08:38.070" style="s2">understanding and relating to it so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:41.580" style="s2">those are the two issues I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.070" end="00:08:43.349" style="s2">sort of try and get get clear about I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.580" end="00:08:48.570" style="s2">just one other thing in there that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.349" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">just the paper that you and Chris wrote</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.570" end="00:08:54.970" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s so good</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.970" end="00:09:00.530" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna actually start off our our</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">our series of videos where we go through</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.530" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">the Platonic dialogues winning paper</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">because I think it it frames it</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">perfectly and grounds it and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:13.670" style="s2">our time and related you there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:15.290" style="s2">that you formulated the problem which I</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.670" end="00:09:17.210" style="s2">just thought was I&#39;ve just been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.290" end="00:09:21.110" style="s2">about it ever since which is the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.210" end="00:09:25.460" style="s2">the second person like post modernity is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.110" end="00:09:27.620" style="s2">the loss of the other basically in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.460" end="00:09:29.690" style="s2">particular kind of way yes yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.620" end="00:09:31.520" style="s2">right and I had never thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.690" end="00:09:34.760" style="s2">quite like that but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.520" end="00:09:39.920" style="s2">about just that sense of where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.760" end="00:09:42.620" style="s2">blind right to what one presupposes what</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.920" end="00:09:46.610" style="s2">gives a dye up a genuine dialogue owes</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.620" end="00:09:50.450" style="s2">right yeah yeah yeah I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.610" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">goes towards both my questions I&#39;m no</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.450" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">surprise because you know I&#39;m posing the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:58.730" style="s2">question that I wrote the paper with</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:10:00.380" style="s2">Chris so but the the idea that that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.730" end="00:10:03.050" style="s2">logos might actually again cut across</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.380" end="00:10:06.380" style="s2">the three categories and it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.050" end="00:10:10.370" style="s2">place in which we&#39;re also finding a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.380" end="00:10:13.160" style="s2">of re-enacting and therefore reimagining</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.370" end="00:10:16.550" style="s2">in urban sense of the word imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.160" end="00:10:20.270" style="s2">imaginal reimagining the sacred and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.550" end="00:10:24.070" style="s2">I&#39;m I would like to talk about that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.270" end="00:10:27.050" style="s2">connection to the two questions I raised</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.070" end="00:10:30.160" style="s2">yeah let me just briefly maybe summarize</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.050" end="00:10:31.790" style="s2">with de Gennaro and I talked about some</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.160" end="00:10:36.340" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.790" end="00:10:36.340" style="s2">it was on Nietzsche and Heidegger on</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.000" end="00:10:46.010" style="s2">definitions of nihilism and for</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.780" end="00:10:48.440" style="s2">Nietzsche nihilism is that beings are</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.010" end="00:10:52.370" style="s2">nothing beings are senseless they amount</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.440" end="00:10:54.010" style="s2">to nothing while and and that for</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.370" end="00:10:58.070" style="s2">Heidegger means that Nietzsche here</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.010" end="00:11:00.410" style="s2">turns all of metaphysics on its head but</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.070" end="00:11:02.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a physician why because he begins</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.410" end="00:11:06.020" style="s2">with beings and then leaps to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.630" end="00:11:09.230" style="s2">beingness of beings and then Hyde again</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.020" end="00:11:12.710" style="s2">the second Nietzsche book rights or</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.230" end="00:11:15.860" style="s2">argues that authentic nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.710" end="00:11:17.720" style="s2">I&#39;m listening mismos would mean not</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.860" end="00:11:20.110" style="s2">meaninglessness in this sense that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.720" end="00:11:23.420" style="s2">usually how we usually think of it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.110" end="00:11:26.810" style="s2">what mean that being itself always</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.420" end="00:11:29.090" style="s2">already stays away being itself amounts</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.810" end="00:11:31.760" style="s2">to nothing and that&#39;s not a value</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.090" end="00:11:34.130" style="s2">judgment that&#39;s not a moral problem but</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.760" end="00:11:37.940" style="s2">being it is always already withdrawing</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.130" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">and then what metaphysics has perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.940" end="00:11:45.410" style="s2">you could say failed to see or fail to</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:49.070" style="s2">understand is that being itself is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.410" end="00:11:53.180" style="s2">which withdraws self conceals self</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.070" end="00:11:55.400" style="s2">denies itself and has instead posited</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.180" end="00:11:58.190" style="s2">the beingness of beings right has</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.400" end="00:11:59.990" style="s2">ratified being for example as a to come</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.190" end="00:12:03.680" style="s2">back to what you mentioned John the</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.990" end="00:12:05.630" style="s2">untrue theology comes posits being as</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.680" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">the causal soui that means the ground</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.630" end="00:12:11.680" style="s2">that causes itself and tries to give</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:15.340" style="s2">ultimate grounds and here we have as</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.680" end="00:12:18.740" style="s2">Heidegger also says in connection to</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.340" end="00:12:21.530" style="s2">Sciences which try to give the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.740" end="00:12:25.310" style="s2">you know a ground for all beings whereas</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.530" end="00:12:27.590" style="s2">what we perhaps in exercise can learn we</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.310" end="00:12:29.810" style="s2">should learn is that ground always</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.590" end="00:12:33.230" style="s2">withdraws that it&#39;s temporal is</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.810" end="00:12:34.790" style="s2">historical yeah so those are just a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.230" end="00:12:37.070" style="s2">couple of thoughts maybe it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.790" end="00:12:38.450" style="s2">beginning so one quick one connection</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.070" end="00:12:40.370" style="s2">and well maybe we can pick up we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.450" end="00:12:43.580" style="s2">have to do it immediately on that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.370" end="00:12:45.830" style="s2">interested in nishitani stake on that as</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.580" end="00:12:48.530" style="s2">in religion and nothingness in certain</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.830" end="00:12:52.390" style="s2">enters into a long sort of reflection on</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.530" end="00:12:55.550" style="s2">that and he he makes the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.390" end="00:12:58.310" style="s2">Asian particularly Buddhist philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.550" end="00:13:01.730" style="s2">has an advantage because it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.310" end="00:13:05.030" style="s2">an established history of prioritising</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.730" end="00:13:08.390" style="s2">being over non being and prioritizing</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.030" end="00:13:10.730" style="s2">actuality over a possibility and that in</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.390" end="00:13:14.300" style="s2">fact Taoism and Buddhism you see the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.730" end="00:13:17.810" style="s2">aucd inverse actually in a he and he</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.300" end="00:13:19.670" style="s2">argues that it&#39;s that kind of ability to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.810" end="00:13:19.910" style="s2">stand on the inversion point between the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.670" end="00:13:21.800" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.910" end="00:13:22.970" style="s2">physics he talked about you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.800" end="00:13:24.290" style="s2">pivot point and that&#39;s where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.970" end="00:13:26.870" style="s2">trying to get in your thinking right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:29.690" style="s2">so you can pivot between these two and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.870" end="00:13:32.440" style="s2">you can get to this place where you do</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.690" end="00:13:35.540" style="s2">this sort of fundamental aspect shift on</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.440" end="00:13:36.500" style="s2">so you&#39;re not changing if this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.540" end="00:13:37.850" style="s2">right word I don&#39;t even know this right</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.500" end="00:13:38.810" style="s2">word I seriously don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.850" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2">the right word but you&#39;re not changing</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.810" end="00:13:43.430" style="s2">the fact of nihilism you&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.300" end="00:13:46.970" style="s2">sort of fundamental aspect shift on it</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.430" end="00:13:49.160" style="s2">yeah I mean from seeing it as some kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.970" end="00:13:52.340" style="s2">of deep privation to seeing it as some</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.160" end="00:13:54.170" style="s2">kind of deep affordance so I&#39;d like I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.340" end="00:13:55.340" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s I&#39;d like to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.170" end="00:13:57.410" style="s2">on that too because I didn&#39;t ever get a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.340" end="00:14:00.380" style="s2">chance to talk about the Kyoto School in</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.410" end="00:14:02.870" style="s2">this and and it&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.380" end="00:14:06.590" style="s2">because I think they&#39;re they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.870" end="00:14:10.820" style="s2">some well I particularly think mr.</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.590" end="00:14:12.920" style="s2">Tony&#39;s work is brilliant yeah so hide</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.820" end="00:14:16.760" style="s2">again being in time says possibility</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.920" end="00:14:19.430" style="s2">stands higher than actuality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.760" end="00:14:21.500" style="s2">vaguely sky this is the total it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.430" end="00:14:24.590" style="s2">inversion of the history of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.500" end="00:14:26.570" style="s2">Hey perfectly clear actuality is higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.590" end="00:14:29.630" style="s2">than possibility and actually subsumes</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.630" end="00:14:36.680" style="s2">simply a dialectical version of</p>

<p begin="00:14:42.200" end="00:14:46.790" style="s2">fiber can listen to Heidegger yeah wow</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.230" end="00:14:49.280" style="s2">this is all of a sudden someone we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.790" end="00:14:51.020" style="s2">actually also understand you know this</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.280" end="00:14:52.310" style="s2">hi to get in touch with Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.020" end="00:14:55.970" style="s2">scholars throughout his life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.310" end="00:14:57.950" style="s2">text dialog where up wish that he</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.970" end="00:15:01.490" style="s2">synthesized from converse conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.950" end="00:15:03.830" style="s2">he had over his lifetime with scholars</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.490" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">from Japan where he says we do live in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.830" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">different houses because we live in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:10.250" style="s2">different languages but there can there</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.110" style="s2">is still a neighborhood it wouldn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.250" end="00:15:13.400" style="s2">sense to speak of a house without the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.110" end="00:15:15.470" style="s2">house is only a house of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.400" end="00:15:16.820" style="s2">neighborhood with its surroundings its</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.470" end="00:15:19.640" style="s2">landscape but another house another</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.820" end="00:15:20.960" style="s2">village somewhere else and there must be</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.640" end="00:15:22.790" style="s2">no I think this is what Heidi girls it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.960" end="00:15:24.700" style="s2">gives up even on the word of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.790" end="00:15:28.070" style="s2">right he says philosophy is over it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.700" end="00:15:29.690" style="s2">again it&#39;s it comes to an end now the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.070" end="00:15:32.090" style="s2">thinking must break free and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:33.800" style="s2">this is this kind of because European</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.090" end="00:15:35.930" style="s2">philosophy never had 2d</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.800" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">what we call metaphysics didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.930" end="00:15:39.560" style="s2">deal with Japanese thought it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:42.370" style="s2">have to deal with Indian thought much it</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.560" end="00:15:44.560" style="s2">was circling around itself and blahblah</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.370" end="00:15:48.890" style="s2">absolute spirit</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.560" end="00:15:50.390" style="s2">let me be your prophet but now it has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.890" end="00:15:53.690" style="s2">deal with it and hiding it breaks free</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.390" end="00:15:57.110" style="s2">from this and that that&#39;s I think where</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.690" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">we I think where we have to go is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.110" end="00:16:02.420" style="s2">have this dialogue between these</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.830" style="s2">different houses of meaning if you like</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.420" end="00:16:07.910" style="s2">these different planes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.830" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">because exactly as you say it so they</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.910" end="00:16:12.140" style="s2">don&#39;t think consider will be called</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.720" style="s2">nihilism from a moral perspective I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:16.790" style="s2">we do bicho though this is dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.720" end="00:16:19.190" style="s2">that don&#39;t go there don&#39;t go to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.790" end="00:16:22.010" style="s2">nothing but for someone like hide again</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.190" end="00:16:24.200" style="s2">and for the Cure to school you begin</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.010" end="00:16:27.560" style="s2">with there is nothing you have to accept</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.200" end="00:16:30.260" style="s2">this withdrawal this denial concealment</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.560" end="00:16:33.710" style="s2">ivy referred to it and only then all of</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.260" end="00:16:36.020" style="s2">us weirdly enough beings light up again</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.710" end="00:16:38.780" style="s2">in their wealth because they&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.020" end="00:16:42.170" style="s2">longer attacked as standing reserve for</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.780" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">example that&#39;s a way of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.170" end="00:16:46.210" style="s2">beings as in terms of a beingness of</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:48.830" style="s2">beings is something waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.210" end="00:16:52.010" style="s2">connected it&#39;s to connect it to thinking</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.830" end="00:16:53.860" style="s2">of beings only insofar as they act and</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.010" end="00:16:56.270" style="s2">picking up on this on the key of</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.860" end="00:16:59.540" style="s2">actuality is you know how things act</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.270" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">right and which is different right right</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.540" end="00:17:04.700" style="s2">right from from how they are and in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:06.980" style="s2">sense of both you know the phenomena are</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.700" end="00:17:09.380" style="s2">they shine into infinity as you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.980" end="00:17:13.130" style="s2">they&#39;re also withdrawing at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.380" end="00:17:14.720" style="s2">time yeah this is what I think even</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.130" end="00:17:17.200" style="s2">Aristotle shied away from this because</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.720" end="00:17:19.400" style="s2">Dunamis which is the word Dunamis is</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.200" end="00:17:21.800" style="s2">potentiality in Greek we get the word</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.400" end="00:17:25.040" style="s2">dynamics for that in English Dunamis</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.800" end="00:17:27.350" style="s2">carries with itself nothingness because</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.040" end="00:17:30.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not yet actualized and what is not</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.350" end="00:17:32.170" style="s2">yet actualized is of course there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.140" end="00:17:35.180" style="s2">nothing or you know some version of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.170" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">lingering there but that&#39;s something the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.180" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">the west or Western thoughts or Western</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:45.350" style="s2">philosophy metaphysics etcetera has been</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:46.970" style="s2">scared off right away from both of you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.350" end="00:17:47.150" style="s2">know I&#39;m a deep fan of Neoplatonism but</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.970" end="00:17:48.470" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.150" end="00:17:51.110" style="s2">one area in which I have any criticism</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.470" end="00:17:53.750" style="s2">of neoplatonism and the nishitani makes</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.110" end="00:17:56.180" style="s2">it of course nothingness because you see</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.750" end="00:17:59.410" style="s2">for example in platanus that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.180" end="00:18:02.570" style="s2">potentiality becomes equated with evil</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.410" end="00:18:04.870" style="s2">explicitly now that that adds sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.570" end="00:18:07.100" style="s2">that have an important call cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.870" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">even ontological function because it</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.100" end="00:18:11.270" style="s2">gave up I gave a locus for evil and</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:13.670" style="s2">therefore rendered it in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.270" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">metaphysically intelligible right even</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.670" end="00:18:17.540" style="s2">saying that it&#39;s a place of non</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:19.370" style="s2">intelligibility only makes sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.540" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">can situate it within a field of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.370" end="00:18:23.510" style="s2">intelligibility right and so I get why I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:25.730" style="s2">get why that was an attractive idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.510" end="00:18:29.300" style="s2">right I see why that&#39;s a very attractive</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.730" end="00:18:32.350" style="s2">idea why people work adhere to it but I</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.300" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">think I think what I&#39;m saying is I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.350" end="00:18:37.510" style="s2">it&#39;s converging with your point is it</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:40.850" style="s2">permanently besmirched you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.510" end="00:18:43.580" style="s2">potentiality with you know the taint of</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.850" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">the chaotic and the evil and the demonic</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.580" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s why it&#39;s very hard like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:50.560" style="s2">I&#39;m even trying to teach dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:53.060" style="s2">systems and which is directly related to</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.560" end="00:18:55.330" style="s2">Dynamis again both when I try to say</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.060" end="00:18:57.680" style="s2">look you have to shift and I you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.330" end="00:18:59.300" style="s2">I&#39;ll put a piece of chalk on a table and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.680" end="00:19:01.220" style="s2">I&#39;ll push it and I&#39;ll say well why did</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.300" end="00:19:02.750" style="s2">it move you know say well because you</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.220" end="00:19:04.910" style="s2">pushed it I said well but why else did</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.750" end="00:19:06.380" style="s2">it move right and then look at me and</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.910" end="00:19:09.050" style="s2">they&#39;ll look at me well you wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.380" end="00:19:10.850" style="s2">move no no no no no not that why did it</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.050" end="00:19:12.800" style="s2">move and there&#39;ll be a silence for a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.850" end="00:19:14.690" style="s2">while and in silence and then when</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.800" end="00:19:17.710" style="s2">somebody will say well because there was</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.690" end="00:19:20.510" style="s2">like open space in front of it ah ah</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:23.000" style="s2">like so but why are you so fixated on</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.510" end="00:19:25.400" style="s2">the event why can&#39;t you see the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.000" end="00:19:27.230" style="s2">constraints that make things possible as</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.400" end="00:19:30.950" style="s2">opposed to the events that are making</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.230" end="00:19:32.900" style="s2">things act right right so we like we</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.950" end="00:19:35.750" style="s2">like even just trying to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.900" end="00:19:37.130" style="s2">something you know this example Asif II</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.750" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">this is just trying to get them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.130" end="00:19:40.940" style="s2">understand dynamical systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:43.280" style="s2">I have dispersed I have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.940" end="00:19:45.620" style="s2">metaphysical move at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:49.550" style="s2">the class of getting them to break away</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.620" end="00:19:51.740" style="s2">from regarding actuality as a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.550" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">for reality and just getting them to</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.740" end="00:19:55.430" style="s2">break that in their mind then it takes</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:19:58.550" style="s2">them some time to do it but once they do</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.430" end="00:20:00.580" style="s2">it I can I can I can see this sort of oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.550" end="00:20:02.289" style="s2">oh and then you see</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.580" end="00:20:03.940" style="s2">all these and then they realize all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.289" end="00:20:06.399" style="s2">possibilities for addressing a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.940" end="00:20:09.039" style="s2">you know sort of really tricky thorny</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.399" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">problems I now have a space in which you</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.039" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">can address them that you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.720" end="00:20:14.080" style="s2">address them before but it I&#39;m only</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:17.649" style="s2">pointing out for this because it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.080" end="00:20:19.240" style="s2">so how pervasive this way of thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.649" end="00:20:21.100" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I like when I read</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.240" end="00:20:22.899" style="s2">religion religion and nothing that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.100" end="00:20:25.870" style="s2">the first time it just looked like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.899" end="00:20:28.179" style="s2">really blew my mind because I thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.870" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s idea about that Ichi just</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.179" end="00:20:33.130" style="s2">inverts but I didn&#39;t get I needed</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:34.990" style="s2">something like nishitani to say but</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.130" end="00:20:36.820" style="s2">what&#39;s different from the like just the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.990" end="00:20:38.679" style="s2">inversion what what&#39;s what&#39;s the trans</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.820" end="00:20:41.139" style="s2">framing for you is one of my terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.679" end="00:20:42.340" style="s2">this looked like initiative gave me a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.139" end="00:20:44.980" style="s2">sort of a really</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.340" end="00:20:50.260" style="s2">so my first deep understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.980" end="00:20:53.289" style="s2">that might look like yeah yeah in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.260" end="00:20:54.940" style="s2">that sense of you know what that that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.289" end="00:20:59.980" style="s2">exercise that you just said so much</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.940" end="00:21:01.630" style="s2">demonstrates I think is is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.980" end="00:21:06.090" style="s2">thing that Heidegger is getting at which</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.630" end="00:21:08.440" style="s2">is about this whole techno in-frame</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.090" end="00:21:12.970" style="s2">movement where it&#39;s it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.440" end="00:21:15.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like it this time it figure eise&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.970" end="00:21:18.970" style="s2">everything right so like the moment the</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.940" end="00:21:21.519" style="s2">moment the ground right or a background</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.970" end="00:21:24.990" style="s2">it it just keeps figure a guy like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.519" end="00:21:27.940" style="s2">only valid if it&#39;s positionable right</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.990" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">locatable and it&#39;s and that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.940" end="00:21:33.039" style="s2">that&#39;s just really I think I keep</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">finding myself impressed with that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.039" end="00:21:38.220" style="s2">that sense of know that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:40.769" style="s2">intelligibility right there is an</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.220" end="00:21:43.899" style="s2">understanding that that I&#39;m inside of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.769" end="00:21:45.669" style="s2">right that organizes everything mmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.899" end="00:21:47.710" style="s2">which that I don&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.669" end="00:21:51.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not even personal it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.710" end="00:21:52.659" style="s2">I&#39;m it&#39;s constituting and how things</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.010" end="00:21:55.419" style="s2">make sense right</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.659" end="00:21:57.220" style="s2">until that motion word that just just</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.419" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2">that there&#39;s that issue where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.220" end="00:22:02.980" style="s2">well why do you always just figure the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.980" end="00:22:05.889" style="s2">events and you just have to be up to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.980" end="00:22:07.570" style="s2">date sit sit with them to be able to see</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.889" end="00:22:09.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s a there&#39;s a ground that</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.570" end="00:22:13.510" style="s2">allows for this that withdrawals that</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.880" end="00:22:14.490" style="s2">you can&#39;t figure right that that is very</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.510" end="00:22:16.619" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.490" end="00:22:21.749" style="s2">well can we can we pick up on that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.619" end="00:22:22.919" style="s2">because that goes towards uh what was it</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.749" end="00:22:24.509" style="s2">my first question like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.919" end="00:22:26.070" style="s2">understanding you&#39;re talking about guy</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.509" end="00:22:27.960" style="s2">this is what this one I want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.070" end="00:22:29.610" style="s2">slow down on and try and zoom in on</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.960" end="00:22:34.409" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.610" end="00:22:37.580" style="s2">out about you know something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.409" end="00:22:40.139" style="s2">trans categorical that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.580" end="00:22:42.749" style="s2">encompasses it&#39;s not it&#39;s not orthogonal</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.139" end="00:22:44.220" style="s2">to but it&#39;s not reducible to any one of</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.749" end="00:22:47.519" style="s2">these categories so I&#39;m reducible to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.220" end="00:22:49.470" style="s2">cognitive or the existential or or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.519" end="00:22:51.990" style="s2">ontological and I suggested to you that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.470" end="00:22:54.690" style="s2">maybe sacredness is like that and and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.990" end="00:22:56.549" style="s2">think you&#39;re try it sounds to me lets me</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.690" end="00:22:58.559" style="s2">speak very clearly carefully it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.549" end="00:23:00.720" style="s2">to me like you&#39;re trying to point to a</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.559" end="00:23:02.669" style="s2">kind of understanding a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.720" end="00:23:05.460" style="s2">comportment to that kind of trans</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.669" end="00:23:08.580" style="s2">categorical sacredness and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.460" end="00:23:09.899" style="s2">we could touch on unpack that together i</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.580" end="00:23:13.740" style="s2">think that would be very helpful because</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.899" end="00:23:16.740" style="s2">i think that goes towards this issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.740" end="00:23:19.470" style="s2">about you know what the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.740" end="00:23:20.820" style="s2">is and how it I agreed if we shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.470" end="00:23:21.419" style="s2">identify the meaning crisis with</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.820" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.419" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">I think nihilism is a perennial aspect</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:30.179" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain sense in which it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:31.619" style="s2">now you know maybe to use your term guys</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.179" end="00:23:34.649" style="s2">worked before grounded or more figured</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.619" end="00:23:36.450" style="s2">for people and I would but I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.649" end="00:23:37.649" style="s2">even want to equate that exactly with</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.450" end="00:23:40.529" style="s2">the meaning crisis I would say something</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.649" end="00:23:41.850" style="s2">like nihilism is an aspect of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.529" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">meaning crisis because when I when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.850" end="00:23:47.820" style="s2">pointing to the meaning crisis I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">trying to point to not just a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.820" end="00:23:55.259" style="s2">what&#39;s the word like an event or rights</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:56.220" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to point to also well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.259" end="00:23:57.570" style="s2">trying to point to all three of these</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.220" end="00:23:59.519" style="s2">categories I&#39;m trying to point to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.570" end="00:24:01.799" style="s2">psychological aspects I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.519" end="00:24:04.200" style="s2">point to also the suffering the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.799" end="00:24:08.309" style="s2">agency the distress alright I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.200" end="00:24:09.720" style="s2">pointing to a particular realization of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.309" end="00:24:11.940" style="s2">that&#39;s the right word about our</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.720" end="00:24:18.289" style="s2">relationship to being I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.940" end="00:24:22.440" style="s2">point out that this this erodes into</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.289" end="00:24:24.389" style="s2">certain fundamental aspects of how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.440" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">try to do how we how we try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.389" end="00:24:30.590" style="s2">fundamentally make sense and adopt</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">agency in the world so it&#39;s I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.590" end="00:24:35.340" style="s2">for me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a larger category</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.480" end="00:24:37.860" style="s2">than just what is encompassed by</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.340" end="00:24:40.799" style="s2">nihilism in both the popular sense and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.860" end="00:24:41.640" style="s2">and also I think the more profound sense</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.799" end="00:24:43.020" style="s2">that we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.640" end="00:24:46.650" style="s2">talking about sort of the the kyoto</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.020" end="00:24:51.059" style="s2">school so so the meaning crisis then is</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.650" end="00:24:53.850" style="s2">something distinctly modern something of</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.059" end="00:24:56.520" style="s2">this epoch i think so although i would</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.850" end="00:24:58.770" style="s2">want to say that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.520" end="00:25:01.020" style="s2">deeply analogous to it in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.770" end="00:25:02.909" style="s2">Hellenistic period that you have you had</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.020" end="00:25:05.520" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.909" end="00:25:09.059" style="s2">in which there was you know pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.520" end="00:25:12.330" style="s2">sense this connection of a loss of touch</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.059" end="00:25:13.789" style="s2">with realness and there was and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.330" end="00:25:15.779" style="s2">where the whole metaphor of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.789" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">philosopher as the physician of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.779" end="00:25:20.039" style="s2">psyche comes into prominence right and</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:21.630" style="s2">it&#39;s actually it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.039" end="00:25:23.059" style="s2">progenitor of most of our cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.630" end="00:25:25.409" style="s2">therapies today comes out of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.059" end="00:25:28.380" style="s2">particular meaning crisis and what what</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.409" end="00:25:31.500" style="s2">was interesting was the culture was able</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.380" end="00:25:33.390" style="s2">to sort of reconfigure philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.500" end="00:25:36.360" style="s2">what it meant and and then that had</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.390" end="00:25:38.460" style="s2">impacts on religion that sort of seemed</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.360" end="00:25:39.929" style="s2">to have alleviated a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.460" end="00:25:42.570" style="s2">suffering and the distress</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.929" end="00:25:44.460" style="s2">whereas we seem to be in a place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.570" end="00:25:46.649" style="s2">worse off if I can put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.460" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">because of our disconnection from our</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.649" end="00:25:52.230" style="s2">wisdom traditions we don&#39;t seem to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:53.789" style="s2">access to the resources we need in order</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.230" end="00:25:55.409" style="s2">to bring about the transformations that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.789" end="00:25:58.110" style="s2">are analogous to what happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.409" end="00:26:00.720" style="s2">Hellenistic period so in one sense yes</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.110" end="00:26:01.679" style="s2">but yeah I&#39;m gonna say that that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.720" end="00:26:05.159" style="s2">I&#39;d answer that question</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.679" end="00:26:07.020" style="s2">yeah did this just maybe a brought a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.159" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">point but this maybe makes it more</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.020" end="00:26:10.620" style="s2">accessible what what about it is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.840" style="s2">Heidegger means when he speaks of deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.620" end="00:26:16.350" style="s2">science Ferguson hide the Oblivion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.840" end="00:26:18.570" style="s2">forgetting of being yes being cut off</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.350" end="00:26:20.909" style="s2">from what you would say these resources</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.570" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">of wisdom yes without being totally</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.909" end="00:26:25.740" style="s2">divided from and so we try to make sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:27.750" style="s2">by accelerating right over seeing</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.740" end="00:26:30.090" style="s2">yourself as workers or giving ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.750" end="00:26:32.159" style="s2">meaning but the trouble kicking God says</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.090" end="00:26:34.950" style="s2">if you just give meaning to ourselves or</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.159" end="00:26:37.409" style="s2">to something we can throw away that</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.950" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">meaning the next day yes something</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.409" end="00:26:41.309" style="s2">deeper it can&#39;t just be posited by us</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:44.159" style="s2">which is the postmodern subjective</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.309" end="00:26:47.009" style="s2">that tries to get that get that done but</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.159" end="00:26:49.019" style="s2">that totally doesn&#39;t work there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.009" end="00:26:52.200" style="s2">paranoia that maybe kicks into with with</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.019" end="00:26:54.419" style="s2">late modern subjectivity now and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.200" end="00:26:58.799" style="s2">yeah and this sense of being and count</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.419" end="00:27:00.299" style="s2">off I think is what perhaps even what</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:02.129" style="s2">depression indicates worse all right</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.299" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">some well I was gonna say I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.129" end="00:27:06.179" style="s2">say I mean here&#39;s the clear instance of</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:07.379" style="s2">where you know the existential mode the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.179" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">wait okay so there&#39;s an ontological</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.379" end="00:27:12.450" style="s2">thing there&#39;s our relationship to being</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:14.580" style="s2">and then we get our existential mode but</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.450" end="00:27:16.700" style="s2">obviously picked up on by like regard</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.580" end="00:27:20.639" style="s2">but then you see it connecting to</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.700" end="00:27:22.950" style="s2">psychological factors because I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.639" end="00:27:24.720" style="s2">the cognitive science on meaning says</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.950" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">that one of the biggest fun so we tend</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.720" end="00:27:28.259" style="s2">to emphasize our culture like to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:30.330" style="s2">that in fact we use this as a synonym</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.259" end="00:27:32.519" style="s2">and it also shows again this collapse</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.330" end="00:27:35.580" style="s2">into actuality that we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.519" end="00:27:37.320" style="s2">about right that muck that top my my</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.580" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">might my life is meaningful if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.320" end="00:27:41.850" style="s2">purpose and it&#39;s this right it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:43.740" style="s2">purpose all right now having a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.850" end="00:27:45.809" style="s2">purpose in fact does psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.740" end="00:27:49.230" style="s2">contribute to meaning life but not as</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.809" end="00:27:50.700" style="s2">much as a sense of mattering which is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.230" end="00:27:53.909" style="s2">sense of being connected to something</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.700" end="00:27:56.700" style="s2">that is larger than yourself that has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.909" end="00:28:00.899" style="s2">value independent of your egocentric</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.700" end="00:28:03.629" style="s2">desires alright and so it so basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.899" end="00:28:05.220" style="s2">what it does to put it into a phrase and</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.629" end="00:28:06.690" style="s2">this then takes it back into kirkegaard</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.220" end="00:28:08.519" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll see why in a sec it</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.690" end="00:28:11.999" style="s2">challenged you to it challenges you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.519" end="00:28:14.129" style="s2">aspire to transformation right because</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.999" end="00:28:15.419" style="s2">the only way of appropriately relating</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.129" end="00:28:17.820" style="s2">the only way of connecting to something</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.419" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">that you accept is larger than yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.820" end="00:28:22.619" style="s2">is through some kind of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:25.649" style="s2">some kind of self transcendence right</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.619" end="00:28:27.960" style="s2">and so that mattering to people is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.649" end="00:28:29.730" style="s2">actually psychologically crucial but it</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.960" end="00:28:31.830" style="s2">takes you into this existential project</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.730" end="00:28:33.450" style="s2">of aspirate of the aspiration of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.830" end="00:28:35.850" style="s2">transcendence and then that puts you</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.450" end="00:28:38.639" style="s2">back into the ontological problem of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.850" end="00:28:43.529" style="s2">what the heck does self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.639" end="00:28:45.029" style="s2">mean in our oncology so that&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.529" end="00:28:46.830" style="s2">mean about how I see all three connected</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.029" end="00:28:48.629" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s a good sort of case study</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.830" end="00:28:51.019" style="s2">of exactly what I&#39;m trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.629" end="00:28:51.019" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.119" end="00:29:00.649" style="s2">it&#39;s yes well I just don&#39;t yeah I just I</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.039" end="00:29:04.999" style="s2">love what you&#39;re what you&#39;re put I love</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.649" end="00:29:07.659" style="s2">what you&#39;re possessed by John I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.999" end="00:29:11.559" style="s2">did I just I didn&#39;t mean to do I get</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.659" end="00:29:11.559" style="s2">overwhelming I just like it</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.629" end="00:29:16.369" style="s2">I I&#39;m actually feeling like I&#39;m just a</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.369" end="00:29:21.830" style="s2">connections sneaking themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.759" end="00:29:24.200" style="s2">that like the way that the cognitive and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.830" end="00:29:26.389" style="s2">the existential and the ontological are</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.200" end="00:29:27.769" style="s2">all they&#39;re not identical I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.769" end="00:29:31.519" style="s2">reduction here but you see how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.389" end="00:29:34.940" style="s2">interdependent and therefore the problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.519" end="00:29:36.259" style="s2">if that&#39;s the right word of what would</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.940" end="00:29:38.809" style="s2">the issue that we&#39;re trying to address</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.259" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">is not one that can simply be addressed</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.809" end="00:29:45.259" style="s2">by therapy or even by philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:48.379" style="s2">academic sense yeah no no no it must be</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.259" end="00:29:50.330" style="s2">back in the policy it must be back in in</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.379" end="00:29:54.169" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re philosophy always was</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.330" end="00:29:57.379" style="s2">strongest yes yes back in the call it</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.169" end="00:29:59.859" style="s2">public sphere whatever but it meets and</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.379" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">it needs to be right when you speak off</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.859" end="00:30:04.970" style="s2">but this sense that I matter but I met</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:08.059" style="s2">her because there&#39;s something else that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.970" end="00:30:11.599" style="s2">matters more than than just I yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.059" end="00:30:15.499" style="s2">true sense of awe a sense of dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.599" end="00:30:19.099" style="s2">divinities yes I like that you know God</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.499" end="00:30:21.619" style="s2">isn&#39;t the reason with the capital R and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.099" end="00:30:26.840" style="s2">we all bow down to our own magnificent</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.619" end="00:30:28.789" style="s2">powers but there&#39;s something what Heidi</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.840" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">could keeps talking about the uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.789" end="00:30:31.489" style="s2">right yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.379" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m Kennie over the world and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.489" end="00:30:35.029" style="s2">is not a moral statement this is to say</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.379" end="00:30:37.309" style="s2">there is something uncanny even just</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.029" end="00:30:38.749" style="s2">about existence the sheer fact isset e</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.309" end="00:30:40.759" style="s2">of existence is uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.749" end="00:30:43.489" style="s2">but that uncanny ness is an imitation</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.759" end="00:30:45.229" style="s2">that on cane is an invitation to think</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.489" end="00:30:48.970" style="s2">after what&#39;s actually going on and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.229" end="00:30:52.729" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s very important to me is is</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.970" end="00:30:53.840" style="s2">memory is shared if you like in English</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.729" end="00:30:56.210" style="s2">I think yes you could say something like</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.840" end="00:30:59.539" style="s2">a shared sense of memory that&#39;s larger</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.210" end="00:31:01.070" style="s2">than just my memory I&#39;m gonna gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.539" end="00:31:02.389" style="s2">leaping around a bit now so apologies</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.070" end="00:31:04.249" style="s2">for that but when you think of how</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.389" end="00:31:04.980" style="s2">transhumanism for example tries to sell</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.249" end="00:31:07.110" style="s2">us in motel</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.980" end="00:31:08.940" style="s2">which would mean that all our memories</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.110" end="00:31:12.090" style="s2">get shared in the cloud that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.940" end="00:31:14.100" style="s2">copy of yourself that&#39;s probably not how</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.090" end="00:31:16.230" style="s2">I would think how memory works I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.100" end="00:31:19.500" style="s2">that memory is much larger its share</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.230" end="00:31:23.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a extend itself that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.500" end="00:31:25.889" style="s2">were thrown into and you share in that a</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.360" end="00:31:28.769" style="s2">sense of memory that we are being cut</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.889" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">off from because we are basically</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.769" end="00:31:34.860" style="s2">encapsulates it isolated pinned down</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:37.919" style="s2">just on us just me and it&#39;s just my</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.860" end="00:31:40.350" style="s2">subjectivity that matters I I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.919" end="00:31:42.630" style="s2">ground of my world transformation is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.350" end="00:31:44.340" style="s2">just about optimizing my cells in order</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.630" end="00:31:47.010" style="s2">to get better in order to to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.340" end="00:31:49.649" style="s2">this and that but it&#39;s never or not</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.010" end="00:31:53.639" style="s2">often at least getting back to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.649" end="00:31:55.950" style="s2">sense of understanding again what what</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.639" end="00:32:00.029" style="s2">are the fundamental questions off for</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.950" end="00:32:02.059" style="s2">example existence and if we do so and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.029" end="00:32:06.330" style="s2">that that would have to accept however</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.059" end="00:32:08.250" style="s2">finitude and death and and also certain</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.330" end="00:32:09.990" style="s2">powerlessness not an entire</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.250" end="00:32:13.980" style="s2">powerlessness but to a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.990" end="00:32:17.669" style="s2">powerlessness in the face of existence</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.980" end="00:32:20.250" style="s2">itself so that&#39;s interesting so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.669" end="00:32:25.350" style="s2">two things I want to bring up about that</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.250" end="00:32:27.169" style="s2">then so a question is a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.350" end="00:32:29.820" style="s2">between Heidegger sense of the uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.169" end="00:32:31.260" style="s2">and Auto sense of the numinous which</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.820" end="00:32:33.570" style="s2">Chris and I talked about quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.260" end="00:32:38.570" style="s2">they&#39;re both post content so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.570" end="00:32:41.880" style="s2">completely irrelevant now and and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.570" end="00:32:44.190" style="s2">the what what that has to do with again</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.880" end="00:32:45.600" style="s2">with this this this thing I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.190" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">about the sacredness because presumably</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.600" end="00:32:50.850" style="s2">the sacred wood would do exactly what I</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:53.070" style="s2">said it would give you the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.850" end="00:32:55.590" style="s2">muttering that puts you into the correct</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.070" end="00:32:58.440" style="s2">existential mode of aspiration right</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.590" end="00:33:00.600" style="s2">that then also gave you a sense of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.440" end="00:33:04.139" style="s2">affordance of self transcendence that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.600" end="00:33:05.940" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just subjective projection that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.139" end="00:33:09.899" style="s2">was in some set had some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.940" end="00:33:11.580" style="s2">connectedness to reality to it and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.899" end="00:33:14.850" style="s2">that&#39;s again helps me to sharpen that a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.580" end="00:33:18.360" style="s2">little bit and so what role does the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.850" end="00:33:19.740" style="s2">like is the uncanny like the numinous or</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.360" end="00:33:22.860" style="s2">are they just different ways of the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.740" end="00:33:25.680" style="s2">thing and then what did and again what</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.860" end="00:33:29.250" style="s2">that has to do with collective memory</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.680" end="00:33:30.900" style="s2">because one thing I see religions doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.250" end="00:33:33.030" style="s2">and this has come out in my discussions</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.900" end="00:33:35.540" style="s2">with Paul van der clay is they represent</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.030" end="00:33:38.220" style="s2">a distributed cognitive memory of</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.540" end="00:33:40.410" style="s2">encounters with the sacred right and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.220" end="00:33:42.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s not it doesn&#39;t belong to any</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.410" end="00:33:44.520" style="s2">one person for precisely that was the</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.150" end="00:33:46.500" style="s2">holy idea of ecclesia the body of Christ</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.520" end="00:33:51.990" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s a car it&#39;s a distributed</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.500" end="00:33:54.300" style="s2">a thing across time and John cars really</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.990" end="00:33:55.890" style="s2">talks about this a lot in his book the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.300" end="00:33:59.400" style="s2">religious case against belief where he</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.890" end="00:34:02.190" style="s2">said we&#39;ve lost that sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.400" end="00:34:04.710" style="s2">what you actually have you have like</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.190" end="00:34:07.410" style="s2">this this I don&#39;t know what to call it</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.710" end="00:34:09.450" style="s2">it&#39;s this sort of structure that keeps</p>

<p begin="00:35:25.080" end="00:35:31.200" style="s2">we speak more and more and in terms that</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.840" end="00:35:31.770" style="s2">are very technical and not no longer</p>

<p begin="00:36:11.210" end="00:36:14.880" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure so with with Heidegger I</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.710" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">think it&#39;s a bit different because for</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.880" end="00:36:21.270" style="s2">him the gods remain unnamed and they</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:23.280" style="s2">remain withdrawn a bit to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.270" end="00:36:25.140" style="s2">degree and I think he&#39;s trying to do at</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.280" end="00:36:27.660" style="s2">least on my reading I&#39;m not sure if</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.140" end="00:36:32.340" style="s2">that&#39;s correct but he&#39;s trying to in the</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.340" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">when he writes this fifties and sixties</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.990" end="00:36:38.880" style="s2">he gives public talks to engineers etc</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:42.330" style="s2">he tells at a time when there was a</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:44.340" style="s2">great believe that technology could save</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.330" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">us liberate us once and for all we could</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.340" end="00:36:50.760" style="s2">have Ito Pia and Adorno at the time and</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:52.830" style="s2">an sloth talked about how utopia would</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.760" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">come about when we finally give up on</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.830" end="00:36:58.290" style="s2">death right so once we become him also</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:37:01.950" style="s2">that&#39;s when we have utopia or when death</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.290" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">becomes an option for those who want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.950" end="00:37:10.670" style="s2">die for whatever reason but in that time</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:13.109" style="s2">I think he reminds the human being of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.670" end="00:37:16.590" style="s2">simple truth of this capacity of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.109" end="00:37:22.020" style="s2">mortal and that capacity is only however</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.590" end="00:37:23.490" style="s2">possible to even think off when there</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.020" end="00:37:25.320" style="s2">are immortals for Heidegger you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.490" end="00:37:27.869" style="s2">never think one without the other right</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.320" end="00:37:31.260" style="s2">there&#39;s this this so in hi I&#39;m Kenny and</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.869" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">tremana I&#39;m means moon Heimlich unholy</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.260" end="00:37:36.330" style="s2">so the world is unholy but it can also</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:39.090" style="s2">be homely and yeah that&#39;s what I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.330" end="00:37:41.640" style="s2">to get to you know okay because one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.090" end="00:37:43.650" style="s2">the things you know that Chris and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.640" end="00:37:45.540" style="s2">thought about is that the sacred seems</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.650" end="00:37:47.730" style="s2">to be doing both of these it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.540" end="00:37:49.140" style="s2">seems to both be a way of homing us</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.730" end="00:37:51.600" style="s2">against horror</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.140" end="00:37:54.180" style="s2">this is geertz&#39;s notion right of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.600" end="00:37:57.120" style="s2">sacred well at the same time also at</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.180" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">times as you say I&#39;m homing us putting</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.120" end="00:38:02.940" style="s2">us outside of that that sense and it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:05.310" style="s2">immediates between Ok Go Ahead</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.940" end="00:38:06.330" style="s2">this is like this is super because one</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.310" end="00:38:12.480" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.330" end="00:38:14.670" style="s2">is horror horror is so important because</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.480" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">the way we think of Horus and we just</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.670" end="00:38:19.080" style="s2">you know everyday terms horror is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:21.180" style="s2">movie yeah yeah horror is something in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.080" end="00:38:22.680" style="s2">film that&#39;s horrible for two hours and</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.180" end="00:38:24.870" style="s2">then I go home and maybe have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.680" end="00:38:27.390" style="s2">dream but no hora hora and the weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.870" end="00:38:29.520" style="s2">thing is what happens again thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.390" end="00:38:32.070" style="s2">you mono economy not thanks him</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.520" end="00:38:34.610" style="s2">how does he define boredom he calls</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.070" end="00:38:41.190" style="s2">boredom the horror bark we the horror of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.610" end="00:38:44.610" style="s2">emptiness which is perhaps a ride in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.190" end="00:38:47.220" style="s2">horse cart is is rather dull right this</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.610" end="00:38:50.520" style="s2">is incredibly bourgeois a definition of</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.220" end="00:38:52.590" style="s2">horror but that sort of a cuy but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.520" end="00:38:55.110" style="s2">almost like because the Newman what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.590" end="00:38:57.510" style="s2">what&#39;s the nur woman on the the unnamed</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.110" end="00:38:59.580" style="s2">that&#39;s what it means when can&#39;t this -</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.510" end="00:39:03.930" style="s2">he&#39;s pushing even the essence of things</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.580" end="00:39:06.930" style="s2">all the way to an an unnamed outside -</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.930" end="00:39:09.870" style="s2">in realm of uncanny maybe to a realm off</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.930" end="00:39:11.900" style="s2">of sheer horror - you know HP Lovecraft</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.870" end="00:39:15.180" style="s2">you could think of him for example here</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.900" end="00:39:17.190" style="s2">but but when you think of this in terms</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.180" end="00:39:19.200" style="s2">of Heidegger again in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.190" end="00:39:21.480" style="s2">history of metaphysics metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.200" end="00:39:23.820" style="s2">forgets consumers metaphysics forget</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.480" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">self withdrawal maybe metaphysics also</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.820" end="00:39:27.870" style="s2">forgets horror maybe this history</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:30.900" style="s2">forgets this sheer horror that also is</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.870" end="00:39:33.780" style="s2">at the heart of existence not only but</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.900" end="00:39:37.890" style="s2">also well that gives need to two</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.780" end="00:39:39.660" style="s2">connecting points is the way to go back</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.890" end="00:39:45.660" style="s2">to circle back to mortality the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.660" end="00:39:47.820" style="s2">Eastern or easy attic religions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.660" end="00:39:52.040" style="s2">thinking you know especially you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.820" end="00:39:56.030" style="s2">Indian and Chinese especially Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.040" end="00:39:59.210" style="s2">but there&#39;s the horror of immortality</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.030" end="00:40:02.300" style="s2">yes right which which</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.210" end="00:40:05.329" style="s2">so you know when I talk to people in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.300" end="00:40:07.670" style="s2">West about this and I say I try to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.329" end="00:40:09.710" style="s2">them to understand this idea about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.670" end="00:40:12.140" style="s2">about how important your mortality is</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.710" end="00:40:14.960" style="s2">well no but you know we all they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.140" end="00:40:16.280" style="s2">they&#39;ll say as if it&#39;s axiomatic but we</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.960" end="00:40:18.710" style="s2">all just want to live forever night well</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.280" end="00:40:20.510" style="s2">I say well actually you don&#39;t and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.710" end="00:40:22.040" style="s2">not true about the cultures right other</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.510" end="00:40:25.400" style="s2">cultures actually experience the</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.040" end="00:40:28.240" style="s2">prospect of immortality as deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.400" end="00:40:30.619" style="s2">horrific and and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.240" end="00:40:33.800" style="s2">reincarnation for example is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.619" end="00:40:36.140" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to break free from in many</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.800" end="00:40:37.849" style="s2">versions of Hinduism and of coke and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.140" end="00:40:39.980" style="s2">same thing with sort of the desire for</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.849" end="00:40:42.109" style="s2">perpetual existence is what binds you</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.980" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">into suffering within Buddhism in</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.109" end="00:40:46.910" style="s2">profound ways and so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:47.930" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.910" end="00:40:51.020" style="s2">connection I&#39;m trying to bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.930" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">to is I think the absence of horror in</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.020" end="00:40:56.780" style="s2">our metaphysics is actually a telling</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:41:00.980" style="s2">thing I think it again points to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.780" end="00:41:04.640" style="s2">fact that we are ultimately seeking a</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.980" end="00:41:09.140" style="s2">kind of security for our intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.640" end="00:41:11.599" style="s2">rather than always trying to nourish our</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.599" end="00:41:19.210" style="s2">those are fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.750" end="00:41:22.280" style="s2">projects for us and that&#39;s the the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.210" end="00:41:28.579" style="s2">security I think I and this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.280" end="00:41:31.880" style="s2">think what the responds to is either</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.579" end="00:41:35.180" style="s2">grossly the withdrawal of being through</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.880" end="00:41:37.490" style="s2">the withdrawal of sense right and and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.180" end="00:41:41.390" style="s2">one of the things I liked in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.490" end="00:41:45.490" style="s2">interview with your teacher he where he</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.390" end="00:41:48.829" style="s2">was talking about the our response right</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.490" end="00:41:51.020" style="s2">what is to it to the withdrawal of sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.829" end="00:41:54.710" style="s2">is ISM is it is to take this hyper</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.020" end="00:41:57.920" style="s2">morality position right oh great I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.710" end="00:42:01.549" style="s2">sorry it where we go we we experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.920" end="00:42:07.369" style="s2">the loss of sense but we don&#39;t we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.549" end="00:42:12.190" style="s2">recognize we we we we compensate for it</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.369" end="00:42:14.500" style="s2">by just being really upset about things</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.190" end="00:42:17.020" style="s2">right and being offended about things</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.500" end="00:42:19.510" style="s2">and what you&#39;re saying is you can notice</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.020" end="00:42:22.329" style="s2">that like rationality doesn&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.510" end="00:42:26.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even consider rationality no no</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.329" end="00:42:29.589" style="s2">in that that that responds to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.079" end="00:42:33.400" style="s2">withdrawal of of the sense of beingness</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.589" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">of the of the fullness of things we</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.400" end="00:42:37.869" style="s2">we&#39;ve excluded from our notion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:40.300" style="s2">rationality edie any sense of this whole</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.869" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">side of the spectrum if I could put it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.300" end="00:42:44.130" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:49.060" style="s2">rationality has has been truncated to</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.130" end="00:42:52.060" style="s2">confirmation coherence the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.060" end="00:42:54.400" style="s2">insight and transformation and a</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.060" end="00:42:55.750" style="s2">capacity for wonder in Plato&#39;s sense not</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.400" end="00:42:57.670" style="s2">Aristotle sense because I think for</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.750" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">Aristotle it&#39;s for my curiosity for</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.670" end="00:43:01.990" style="s2">Plato it&#39;s clearly ah that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:03.970" style="s2">things are actually crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.990" end="00:43:05.980" style="s2">forgetting for example overcoming all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.970" end="00:43:07.930" style="s2">this self-deception that our ego</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.980" end="00:43:09.400" style="s2">centrism and our narcissism makes us</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.930" end="00:43:12.609" style="s2">pray to and they should therefore be</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.400" end="00:43:15.400" style="s2">central central to our ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.609" end="00:43:17.619" style="s2">rationality not peripheral things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.400" end="00:43:19.750" style="s2">are somehow romantically pursued when</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.619" end="00:43:22.900" style="s2">our rationality is done what it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.750" end="00:43:25.030" style="s2">do for the day I think that is a very</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.900" end="00:43:27.940" style="s2">crucial point what you just did god to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.030" end="00:43:29.800" style="s2">try and that way in which we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.940" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">again this is again we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.800" end="00:43:32.859" style="s2">something ontological and then we shift</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:35.619" style="s2">into the existential and then it</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.859" end="00:43:36.609" style="s2">reverberates back into the cognitive now</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.619" end="00:43:39.310" style="s2">because now we&#39;re bringing up the whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.609" end="00:43:42.040" style="s2">notion of what what does rationality</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.310" end="00:43:43.930" style="s2">because if this is about you know sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.040" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">making rationality should be in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.930" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">discussion but obviously in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">reformulated way so that it comports</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:55.869" style="s2">with what we&#39;re talking about well and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:44:00.130" style="s2">think one of the things that I&#39;m if I</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.869" end="00:44:04.359" style="s2">feel into it like if I I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.130" end="00:44:05.650" style="s2">the things I like about um about real</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.359" end="00:44:10.089" style="s2">what I&#39;ve gotten out of reading</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.650" end="00:44:12.940" style="s2">Heidegger more than his ideas or his</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.089" end="00:44:15.280" style="s2">views and it&#39;s been to read them is to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.940" end="00:44:19.540" style="s2">walk on the path of looking to that</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.280" end="00:44:22.450" style="s2">which reveals it&#39;s uncanny nasai wanted</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.540" end="00:44:24.640" style="s2">to ask you about that yeah it&#39;s a almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.450" end="00:44:26.080" style="s2">like it&#39;s been a practice for me well</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.640" end="00:44:28.690" style="s2">wholly but I</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.080" end="00:44:30.370" style="s2">found that to be the case and I think I</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.690" end="00:44:32.440" style="s2">did work I had to go would actually like</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.370" end="00:44:36.520" style="s2">me saying this so there&#39;s maybe a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.440" end="00:44:38.200" style="s2">a a performative pun here I found that</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.520" end="00:44:40.570" style="s2">to be the case with all of the really</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.200" end="00:44:42.040" style="s2">great philosophers like I find you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.570" end="00:44:45.850" style="s2">read Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.040" end="00:44:47.590" style="s2">yeah you you base you you you you I</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.850" end="00:44:50.170" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you immerse yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.590" end="00:44:51.490" style="s2">Spinoza until like you you got you</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.170" end="00:44:52.840" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use this word because I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.490" end="00:44:54.340" style="s2">it&#39;s appropriate you have to read you</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.840" end="00:44:55.870" style="s2">have to reads for knows you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.340" end="00:44:58.060" style="s2">recite to knows it to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.870" end="00:45:00.760" style="s2">religiously you have to you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.060" end="00:45:02.800" style="s2">through like if you don&#39;t get scans get</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.760" end="00:45:06.130" style="s2">to atiba when you&#39;re reading you if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.800" end="00:45:07.900" style="s2">doesn&#39;t occur to you then I use all and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.130" end="00:45:08.500" style="s2">all you&#39;ve got is the arguments of</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.900" end="00:45:10.360" style="s2">Spinoza</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.500" end="00:45:12.280" style="s2">I think you&#39;ve missed the ethics I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.360" end="00:45:15.010" style="s2">you didn&#39;t miss the ethics yeah same</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.280" end="00:45:17.590" style="s2">thing with Plato right for like Plato is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.010" end="00:45:20.290" style="s2">sacred to me because like I can keep</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.590" end="00:45:24.010" style="s2">following Plato I can I can go to Plato</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.290" end="00:45:25.930" style="s2">I get insight I get transfer I get the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.010" end="00:45:28.420" style="s2">challenge to transformation I go out in</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.930" end="00:45:30.370" style="s2">the world the world discloses itself to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.420" end="00:45:32.620" style="s2">me in a way that it couldn&#39;t before that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.370" end="00:45:34.480" style="s2">transforms me I go back to Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.620" end="00:45:37.120" style="s2">then I see something again in Plato that</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.480" end="00:45:40.300" style="s2">I didn&#39;t see and I can and so Plato</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.120" end="00:45:42.760" style="s2">engenders and agog a Spinoza engenders</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.300" end="00:45:46.120" style="s2">can see Intuit eva i think the great</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.760" end="00:45:48.940" style="s2">philosophers engender again this a state</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.120" end="00:45:50.770" style="s2">that&#39;s between and beyond the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.940" end="00:45:53.860" style="s2">the existential and the ontological they</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.770" end="00:45:56.050" style="s2">put you into this place i&#39;m struggling</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.860" end="00:45:57.760" style="s2">for words here that isn&#39;t captured by</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.050" end="00:45:59.890" style="s2">those categories and that&#39;s the thing of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.760" end="00:46:03.100" style="s2">any great philosopher is to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.890" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">place with them right and that&#39;s in mmm</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.100" end="00:46:08.620" style="s2">I think I&#39;m right I think I to do would</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:14.530" style="s2">like that sorry to interrupt you but the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.620" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">great philosophers yeah it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.530" end="00:46:21.120" style="s2">what you&#39;re describing is what you could</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.120" style="s2">call the apparition of thinking right</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.180" end="00:46:28.420" style="s2">yes there&#39;s nothing and this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.080" end="00:46:29.170" style="s2">what I thought philosophy would be yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.420" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.170" end="00:46:32.470" style="s2">dee Mia and it was a bit like that with</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:34.540" style="s2">evil</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.470" end="00:46:36.730" style="s2">did you now don&#39;t need to leap but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.540" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">because very small University and I came</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.730" end="00:46:40.150" style="s2">here and it was a bit different but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:42.310" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.150" end="00:46:44.830" style="s2">yeah I think that&#39;s ultimately how</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.310" end="00:46:46.450" style="s2">philosophy should be taught but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.830" end="00:46:48.130" style="s2">care is it this isn&#39;t but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.450" end="00:46:51.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not ultimately that important</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.130" end="00:46:53.290" style="s2">it&#39;s not that important what by the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.160" end="00:46:56.620" style="s2">you might disagree with Plato and some</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.290" end="00:46:58.990" style="s2">things of others but what is it then why</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.620" end="00:47:00.820" style="s2">is it these texts and the way we do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.990" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">what is it that they do with us and why</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.820" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">do we why is it that we can come back to</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:08.710" style="s2">them again and again and again it must</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:11.770" style="s2">actually I&#39;ve read the cave at aghori I</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.710" end="00:47:13.570" style="s2">don&#39;t know how many time exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.770" end="00:47:14.980" style="s2">still I&#39;m reading it I could read every</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.570" end="00:47:18.460" style="s2">week and I would still all right I</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.980" end="00:47:22.420" style="s2">forgot oh really this is every single</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.460" end="00:47:23.560" style="s2">time yeah yes yeah God back to you</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.420" end="00:47:25.660" style="s2">because I cut you off I&#39;m sorry about</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.560" end="00:47:26.950" style="s2">that I just was wondering if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.660" end="00:47:29.170" style="s2">I think I really want to like I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.950" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">this is exciting because it&#39;s drawing I</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.170" end="00:47:32.590" style="s2">think it may be bringing something</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:37.960" style="s2">together if we look at what is it that</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.590" end="00:47:40.090" style="s2">happens in that relationship of reading</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.960" end="00:47:42.940" style="s2">of philosopher right like what are we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.090" end="00:47:46.240" style="s2">exercising and I&#39;m wondering if it</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.940" end="00:47:48.760" style="s2">touches it on the ontological like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.240" end="00:47:51.460" style="s2">cognitive and the existential these</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.760" end="00:47:54.820" style="s2">throwing so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.460" end="00:47:57.730" style="s2">saying and and then and then for me and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.820" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">of course you you probably first saw</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.730" end="00:48:02.710" style="s2">that I was going to do this guy this</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.180" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">logic yeah and and and and and the</p>

<p begin="00:50:44.020" end="00:50:52.540" style="s2">harkening carries with it the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.180" end="00:50:55.660" style="s2">also a receptivity and and and a making</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.790" end="00:51:05.710" style="s2">harkening de because hearken ii like</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.010" end="00:51:07.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit and your hearken is a call to</p>

<p begin="00:51:11.830" end="00:51:16.270" style="s2">think this is starts to Britt this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.660" end="00:51:19.630" style="s2">starts to be break free of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.270" end="00:51:22.510" style="s2">metaphysics right mmm because it&#39;s it to</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.630" end="00:51:24.820" style="s2">here is is to be unclear about what</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.510" end="00:51:28.060" style="s2">you&#39;re hearing but yet to be a tune to</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.820" end="00:51:31.840" style="s2">what you can&#39;t quite make out yet right</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.060" end="00:51:33.220" style="s2">that would whisper ring to you and to to</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.840" end="00:51:34.900" style="s2">be or because this is one of things I</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.220" end="00:51:37.000" style="s2">noticed encircling and leading circling</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.900" end="00:51:38.770" style="s2">of just I noticed this last weekend is</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.000" end="00:51:41.890" style="s2">just sitting with people and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.770" end="00:51:44.230" style="s2">harkening so what is the what are they</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.890" end="00:51:48.310" style="s2">what what&#39;s really present what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.230" end="00:51:50.710" style="s2">present and just tuning into that is I</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.310" end="00:51:54.040" style="s2">can I kept feeling this sense of in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.710" end="00:51:56.590" style="s2">growing sense of tuning in to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.040" end="00:51:59.530" style="s2">movement of showing or something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.590" end="00:52:02.860" style="s2">the that&#39;s in is there&#39;s an orientation</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.530" end="00:52:06.100" style="s2">that just keeps drawing it it has an</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.860" end="00:52:07.720" style="s2">auto poetic quality to it yes yes object</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.100" end="00:52:11.530" style="s2">is not looking for an object or an</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.720" end="00:52:14.620" style="s2">answer it&#39;s something else just at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.530" end="00:52:17.770" style="s2">edge of intelligibility or it reminds me</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.620" end="00:52:19.780" style="s2">I I was circling last night it remind I</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.770" end="00:52:21.100" style="s2">so I said I want to follow the circle</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.780" end="00:52:23.080" style="s2">where it goes but I was invoking</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.100" end="00:52:25.000" style="s2">Socrates is a point of follow the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.080" end="00:52:27.490" style="s2">argument wherever it goes that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.000" end="00:52:29.410" style="s2">that&#39;s the that kind of sense yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.490" end="00:52:30.490" style="s2">wanna I want to hear what you Hannes us</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.410" end="00:52:34.510" style="s2">to say but I want to ask you one</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.490" end="00:52:36.940" style="s2">question guy first so and this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.510" end="00:52:39.550" style="s2">the point we were just on I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.940" end="00:52:42.070" style="s2">to leave you yet because I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.550" end="00:52:45.240" style="s2">brought this up like sort of post</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.070" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">circling I would say saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.240" end="00:52:51.610" style="s2">we&#39;re hearkening to each other and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:54.550" style="s2">even harkening you know to the third</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.610" end="00:52:56.800" style="s2">factor that&#39;s opening between us but but</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.550" end="00:53:01.270" style="s2">it seems to me there&#39;s another like I</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.800" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">said you know I have an allegiance to to</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.270" end="00:53:05.230" style="s2">you the people are circling with an</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:09.490" style="s2">allegiance to or the process but I also</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.230" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">want to be able to I think this is part</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.490" end="00:53:15.130" style="s2">of being an authentically participating</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:17.530" style="s2">it I want to be able to engage my</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.130" end="00:53:20.710" style="s2">allegiance to the topics that might</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.530" end="00:53:24.369" style="s2">emerge yes so for example</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.710" end="00:53:26.500" style="s2">one one person sort of brought up sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.369" end="00:53:29.079" style="s2">of brought the circling practice itself</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.500" end="00:53:30.760" style="s2">into question yeah right and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.079" end="00:53:32.230" style="s2">happened is people just did the circling</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.760" end="00:53:34.660" style="s2">and they sort of tune into each other</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.230" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">and I was kind of like you know no I</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.660" end="00:53:40.180" style="s2">didn&#39;t that no no no no that&#39;s a no</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.359" end="00:53:42.849" style="s2">that&#39;s a lost opportunity you know we we</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.180" end="00:53:45.220" style="s2">we should keep the circle going but</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.849" end="00:53:48.369" style="s2">there you know that person wants to</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.220" end="00:53:50.440" style="s2">wonder about circling rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.369" end="00:53:52.450" style="s2">wonder within circling and those aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.440" end="00:53:54.670" style="s2">the same thing and they should be put</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.450" end="00:53:56.890" style="s2">into a dialogue with each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.670" end="00:53:58.869" style="s2">know what is it what does that mean like</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.890" end="00:54:00.369" style="s2">to subtract and like and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.869" end="00:54:04.059" style="s2">then what happened is we didn&#39;t started</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.369" end="00:54:06.010" style="s2">this discourse around circling which you</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.059" end="00:54:07.630" style="s2">know that&#39;s what I mean about against</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.010" end="00:54:09.460" style="s2">trying to get these things to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.630" end="00:54:10.569" style="s2">each other we should both let Johannes</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.460" end="00:54:15.130" style="s2">say something though he&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.569" end="00:54:16.059" style="s2">patient and kind with us I think um just</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.130" end="00:54:18.250" style="s2">briefly on</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.059" end="00:54:22.359" style="s2">harkening I had not thought of this I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.250" end="00:54:25.650" style="s2">always just you know use the word to</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.359" end="00:54:31.630" style="s2">listen to I will from now on say harken</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.650" end="00:54:35.559" style="s2">it&#39;s also much closer to Hulk and Hulk</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.630" end="00:54:38.289" style="s2">right which is listen but harken in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.559" end="00:54:41.109" style="s2">proper that you have to now really hear</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.289" end="00:54:42.549" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying yes and what we now</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.109" end="00:54:44.079" style="s2">think of as the third where we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.549" end="00:54:45.640" style="s2">classified as the first fragment of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.079" end="00:54:48.779" style="s2">Heraclitus livid actually was his first</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.640" end="00:54:52.089" style="s2">fragment we don&#39;t know he speaks of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.779" end="00:54:55.420" style="s2">cooing so he speaks of the logos and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.089" end="00:54:57.730" style="s2">that we yes yes we are in a hearing</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.420" end="00:54:59.589" style="s2">stance to the bill got yeah yeah but</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.589" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">harkening yeah so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.410" end="00:55:11.049" style="s2">oldest wisdoms that we have or right</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:13.480" style="s2">testimonials of logos is that logos can</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.049" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">be hearkened there&#39;s something as always</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.480" end="00:55:19.150" style="s2">a hearing that&#39;s always something</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:22.029" style="s2">addressing us calling us yeah but what</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.150" end="00:55:24.940" style="s2">we must do is respond we must respond</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.029" end="00:55:26.740" style="s2">and that&#39;s ultimately beautifully in</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.940" end="00:55:30.309" style="s2">English to say this because you can say</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.740" end="00:55:32.680" style="s2">that&#39;s responsibility yes there is this</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.309" end="00:55:35.260" style="s2">deep sense of responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.680" end="00:55:36.940" style="s2">mustn&#39;t be cut off from and it has to do</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.400" end="00:55:45.819" style="s2">that&#39;s something that I that I see in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.450" end="00:55:48.280" style="s2">encircling happening because it works</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.819" end="00:55:51.369" style="s2">with what has been comes back towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.280" end="00:55:52.869" style="s2">you the old time right this is all the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.369" end="00:55:55.900" style="s2">time and I think this is how this really</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.869" end="00:56:00.630" style="s2">works itself and what what we&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.900" end="00:56:03.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve made linear history and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.630" end="00:56:06.190" style="s2">assume that we just move on into an</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.640" end="00:56:09.609" style="s2">empty feel that we can that will</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.190" end="00:56:11.800" style="s2">rearrange and make make it just around</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.609" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">where we please and we&#39;ve completely</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.800" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">forgotten that that which has been is</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:21.309" style="s2">still coming back and maybe not just you</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:31.540" style="s2">know to haunt us but also to give us</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.309" end="00:56:35.710" style="s2">again a sense of direction it&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.540" end="00:56:38.530" style="s2">hands it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.710" end="00:56:40.540" style="s2">says if ever Minden to get over instead</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.530" end="00:56:43.240" style="s2">of overcome instead of over we were</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.540" end="00:56:46.569" style="s2">common so so tame technics</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.240" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">and framing must be finding that means</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.569" end="00:56:52.089" style="s2">you don&#39;t go over it you go right in and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:53.530" style="s2">then you turn it from within because</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.089" end="00:56:55.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not about getting rid of it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.530" end="00:56:57.640" style="s2">about understanding where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.599" end="00:57:00.819" style="s2">hiding who keep saying it does have an</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.640" end="00:57:04.210" style="s2">origin we must find that origin because</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.819" end="00:57:06.819" style="s2">if not them we&#39;re cut off and that means</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.210" end="00:57:12.430" style="s2">we live in Amity in a meaningless world</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.819" end="00:57:16.450" style="s2">it&#39;s quite vacuum huh that&#39;s that just</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.430" end="00:57:20.470" style="s2">that notion of origin right what I the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.450" end="00:57:22.780" style="s2">picture I get from how I hear that is</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.470" end="00:57:26.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like different and source right</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.780" end="00:57:30.130" style="s2">source has kind of like a from to right</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.410" end="00:57:33.430" style="s2">sense to it origin has more of this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.130" end="00:57:36.609" style="s2">somehow present right now right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.430" end="00:57:39.160" style="s2">like somehow present underneath the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.609" end="00:57:41.579" style="s2">origin of something I can add the sense</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.160" end="00:57:45.010" style="s2">of where I can reveal the set the origin</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.579" end="00:57:46.310" style="s2">yeah of this sentence or the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.010" end="00:57:49.160" style="s2">this moment there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.310" end="00:57:51.080" style="s2">there is this kind of quality to it we</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.160" end="00:57:53.030" style="s2">carry that in the adjective original</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.080" end="00:57:54.470" style="s2">yeah we mean it&#39;s a current it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.030" end="00:57:57.080" style="s2">property that something can currently</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.470" end="00:58:00.500" style="s2">have that points back to his origin</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.080" end="00:58:02.780" style="s2">right so there&#39;s a there is that sense</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.500" end="00:58:05.270" style="s2">in the adjective to say that something&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.780" end="00:58:08.060" style="s2">original is actually to talk about how</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.270" end="00:58:10.150" style="s2">it is now even though you&#39;re presumably</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.060" end="00:58:12.260" style="s2">referring to something in its past yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.150" end="00:58:14.720" style="s2">I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.260" end="00:58:16.820" style="s2">original does carry that same origin</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:19.760" style="s2">does carry that sense with it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.820" end="00:58:22.430" style="s2">yeah origin is a is like this right in</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.760" end="00:58:26.060" style="s2">terms of the hand</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.430" end="00:58:29.330" style="s2">it&#39;s the wellspring of meaning yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.060" end="00:58:30.770" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not the source right we said</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.330" end="00:58:33.350" style="s2">that could give rise to being a resource</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.770" end="00:58:35.000" style="s2">etc which then could be sound like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.350" end="00:58:36.860" style="s2">exploiting it but no origin and this is</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.000" end="00:58:39.170" style="s2">what hiding keeps coming back to when he</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.860" end="00:58:40.460" style="s2">says the origin is not something two and</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.170" end="00:58:42.050" style="s2">a half thousand years ago I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.460" end="00:58:44.720" style="s2">go back to the Golden Age of the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.050" end="00:58:46.900" style="s2">know there is something of origin</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.720" end="00:58:50.420" style="s2">waiting in these texts in these</p>

<p begin="00:58:56.780" end="00:59:00.560" style="s2">them right and and the other way of</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.610" end="00:59:02.180" style="s2">dealing with philosophy so we&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.560" end="00:59:04.220" style="s2">this distinction John you made a</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.220" end="00:59:12.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of origin there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.840" end="00:59:14.570" style="s2">something there there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.800" end="00:59:17.180" style="s2">there&#39;s something there when I read</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.570" end="00:59:19.640" style="s2">these texts I come to these texts not</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.180" end="00:59:22.100" style="s2">not to be right or to find the place who</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.640" end="00:59:24.800" style="s2">was wrong but to be transformed by this</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.100" end="00:59:28.130" style="s2">because there must be a reason why Plato</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.800" end="00:59:30.200" style="s2">is Plato right and what I see in</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.130" end="00:59:33.260" style="s2">academic philosophy now is something</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.200" end="00:59:35.660" style="s2">else which is in my mind a bit cut off</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.260" end="00:59:37.670" style="s2">from origin because what we now see is</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.660" end="00:59:40.130" style="s2">Spinoza a realist so is he more of an</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.670" end="00:59:41.960" style="s2">idealist if he is an idealist is he a</p>
