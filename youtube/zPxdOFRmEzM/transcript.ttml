<p begin="00:01:35.759" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">was a piece that came to me in part cuz</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.700" end="00:01:42.619" style="s2">I was talking to an old friend of mine</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">Michael Chan who lives in Hong Kong and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.619" end="00:01:47.579" style="s2">he was telling me about how they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:50.340" style="s2">handling our had handled the SARS</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:51.689" style="s2">epidemic in the past and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.340" end="00:01:53.850" style="s2">things that struck me is that okay you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.689" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">know at first to quarantine absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.850" end="00:01:58.170" style="s2">you know you you wait for this thing to</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:01:59.549" style="s2">stop spreading so that your risk is</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.170" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">maybe going down a little bit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.549" end="00:02:04.530" style="s2">staying out of the out of the out of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">wind but eventually you have to get back</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.530" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">into real life and in order to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">you have to figure out who you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">spend time with you have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:17.970" style="s2">you know who your kid&#39;s gonna go on play</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:20.300" style="s2">dates with you have to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.970" end="00:02:22.410" style="s2">kind of risk you&#39;re willing to take and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.300" end="00:02:24.240" style="s2">when you do that you&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.410" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">use a set of heuristics about you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.240" end="00:02:30.030" style="s2">your sense of risk but then also the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:31.710" style="s2">sense you have of the people you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.030" end="00:02:35.010" style="s2">thinking about spending time with what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.710" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">their sense of risk how cautious have</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.010" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">they been how careful are they how well</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:43.320" style="s2">do they watch their kids or their kids</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:46.380" style="s2">as risky as as they you know as you fear</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.320" end="00:02:48.510" style="s2">that kind of thing so it started me</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.380" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">thinking that we&#39;re gonna have the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.510" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">problem here the world has changed at</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:57.020" style="s2">least for now and you know we&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">ourselves questions that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.020" end="00:03:02.130" style="s2">helped at the very least Jim I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:05.010" style="s2">really offensive to ask you know a month</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.130" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">ago the idea that you wouldn&#39;t spend</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.010" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">time with somebody because you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:08.940" style="s2">afraid they&#39;d have picked up some</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:11.460" style="s2">horrible disease and it was gonna kill</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.940" end="00:03:15.780" style="s2">you that just wasn&#39;t on our radar I know</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.460" end="00:03:19.590" style="s2">it is and so I was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.780" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">okay what what kinds of social norms</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.590" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">arise around risk management for disease</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:31.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s a little bit more than you</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:34.260" style="s2">know what&#39;s the epidemiologically best</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.320" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">practice way of handling your social</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.260" end="00:03:39.090" style="s2">life because you also when you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:41.459" style="s2">these decisions about who to spend time</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.090" end="00:03:44.310" style="s2">with you also have to make your excuses</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.459" end="00:03:46.530" style="s2">right so if you judge someone to be high</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.310" end="00:03:48.690" style="s2">risk and you don&#39;t want to spend time</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.530" end="00:03:51.390" style="s2">with them but you&#39;re otherwise that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.690" end="00:03:52.170" style="s2">socially connected to them what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.390" end="00:03:54.750" style="s2">excuse</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.170" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">do you give right how do you explain</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.750" end="00:03:59.670" style="s2">yourself to others when you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.380" style="s2">the kinds of decisions that in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.670" end="00:04:03.540" style="s2">sense we&#39;ve never been able to we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.380" end="00:04:06.570" style="s2">never had to make before at least in our</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.540" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">living memory yep that&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.570" end="00:04:10.440" style="s2">question you know and the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:12.480" style="s2">that you know it kind of plays into this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.440" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">one of the biggest takeaways I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.480" end="00:04:16.830" style="s2">personally had from this experience is</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:18.900" style="s2">the astounding cognitive diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.830" end="00:04:20.489" style="s2">people who what I would have thought at</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.900" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">a high level at least were fairly</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.489" end="00:04:23.400" style="s2">similar</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">you know people about my age you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.400" end="00:04:28.650" style="s2">about similar levels of education etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:31.590" style="s2">some of them were still going out to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.650" end="00:04:34.170" style="s2">dinner a week ago right you know others</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.590" end="00:04:37.650" style="s2">of us locked down you know three and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.170" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">half weeks ago some people you know are</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.650" end="00:04:41.700" style="s2">still not taking it all that seriously</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:43.080" style="s2">some of the some of the rest of us or</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.700" end="00:04:45.600" style="s2">you know every time we go out we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.080" end="00:04:48.960" style="s2">masks and gloves and raincoats on and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.600" end="00:04:51.210" style="s2">the the spectrum is quite wide right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.960" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a big AHA for me we were all</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.210" end="00:04:55.170" style="s2">presented with the same evidence</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve argued on some of these</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.170" end="00:05:01.530" style="s2">extra shows before that there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:03.210" style="s2">a distinction between people who know</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.530" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">how to think exponentially and those</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.210" end="00:05:06.360" style="s2">that don&#39;t but there&#39;s other things too</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:10.110" style="s2">there&#39;s you know the Big Five</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.360" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">personality models there&#39;s probably you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.110" end="00:05:13.530" style="s2">know people who are more risk takers I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.170" style="s2">known to be a high risk taker but</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.530" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">nonetheless I&#39;ve reacted very quickly I</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.170" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">believe strongly to this and the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:24.060" style="s2">one I&#39;ve noticed interestingly has to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:26.600" style="s2">with our InfoSphere that those who I</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.060" end="00:05:30.630" style="s2">would say are on the political right</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.600" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">were were late to get it even if they</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.630" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">were smart enough and educated enough to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:37.170" style="s2">have the cognitive tools to get it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:39.180" style="s2">because for a while the you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.170" end="00:05:40.890" style="s2">transmitter in chief on that side was</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.180" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">not taking it seriously so that was kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.890" end="00:05:45.540" style="s2">of interesting how people became their</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:49.500" style="s2">views of a factual situation became</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.540" end="00:05:51.180" style="s2">entrained by the mutterings of a shall</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.500" end="00:05:54.360" style="s2">we say less than sharpest knife in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.180" end="00:05:56.670" style="s2">drawer it&#39;s interesting Jim I mean those</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.360" end="00:05:58.830" style="s2">that you&#39;re bringing up some really</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.670" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">great questions here I mean just on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.830" end="00:06:05.160" style="s2">on the overall point of you know who who</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:07.320" style="s2">was seeing this coming who was reacting</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.160" end="00:06:08.970" style="s2">in ways that you know looking back a</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.320" end="00:06:12.030" style="s2">year from now we&#39;ll say were the right</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.970" end="00:06:14.610" style="s2">ways to do it you know part of this was</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.030" end="00:06:19.170" style="s2">I think down to the capacity of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.610" end="00:06:21.180" style="s2">imagination people who were willing not</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.170" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">just to imagine but I think also to act</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.180" end="00:06:27.960" style="s2">on their imaginations were the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:30.600" style="s2">were I think more cautious ahead of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.960" end="00:06:31.970" style="s2">they really will look back and will say</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.600" end="00:06:34.050" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.970" end="00:06:35.880" style="s2">one of things is funny first Jim is that</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:46.620" style="s2">we&#39;re all the conspiracy theorists on</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.270" end="00:06:49.650" style="s2">the right wing so if you don&#39;t used to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.620" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">go all the way past what we think of as</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.940" end="00:08:09.870" style="s2">thing that&#39;s pretty much how our world</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:12.900" style="s2">usually works but you know given the</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.870" end="00:08:15.030" style="s2">extent to which we&#39;re not in agreement</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.900" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">and maybe we ought not to be an</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.030" end="00:08:18.630" style="s2">agreement right now because I think you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:20.610" style="s2">know the most certain thing is the high</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.630" end="00:08:21.930" style="s2">level of uncertainty but given we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.610" end="00:08:23.220" style="s2">in agreement how do we how do we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.930" end="00:08:26.580" style="s2">navigate this sort of very out of</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.220" end="00:08:28.800" style="s2">equilibrium social environment it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.580" end="00:08:29.910" style="s2">something that that we&#39;re very familiar</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.910" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">familiar with personally and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.380" end="00:08:35.400" style="s2">also it&#39;s not something that the social</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:37.770" style="s2">sciences are very familiar with indeed</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.400" end="00:08:40.289" style="s2">in fact you know folks I&#39;m talking with</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.770" end="00:08:42.360" style="s2">we are now using the model that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.289" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">been no shock like this to the United</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.360" end="00:08:47.370" style="s2">States since World War two it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.700" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting right because in terms</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.370" end="00:08:52.110" style="s2">of existential threat right we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.700" end="00:08:53.880" style="s2">okay right you know we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.110" end="00:08:54.730" style="s2">be speaking kovat and you know three</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.730" end="00:09:01.090" style="s2">but in another sense absolutely it is a</p>

<p begin="00:09:01.090" end="00:09:05.230" style="s2">be more of an epistemic hit right then I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.610" end="00:09:08.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know a logical one</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.230" end="00:09:11.080" style="s2">most of us are not at risk from this</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.200" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">disease I mean we we worry about it but</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.080" end="00:09:15.010" style="s2">what we&#39;re really facing I think is is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:17.920" style="s2">sort of dual problem what is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.010" end="00:09:18.970" style="s2">uncertainty about the biology but the</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:20.740" style="s2">other thing that I think we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.970" end="00:09:22.470" style="s2">talked as much about but you&#39;re on this</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.470" end="00:09:27.610" style="s2">we&#39;re also really uncertain about the</p>

<p begin="00:09:48.010" end="00:09:53.260" style="s2">you know to pick up some groceries</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:55.410" style="s2">we&#39;ll see a huge spectrum of beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.260" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">about how we ought to respond and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.410" end="00:10:00.130" style="s2">we&#39;re we have an epistemic uncertainty</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.250" end="00:10:07.210" style="s2">with the virus itself absolutely and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.650" end="00:10:09.070" style="s2">that&#39;s as I said my single biggest</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.210" end="00:10:12.820" style="s2">unexpected learning from this is how</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.070" end="00:10:14.920" style="s2">vast that cognitive model difference is</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.920" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">similar that&#39;s like when staggering to</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">just stone-cold clear if you can do it</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.180" end="00:10:27.910" style="s2">you should absolutely isolate yourself</p>

<p begin="00:10:29.230" end="00:10:33.970" style="s2">course I will say part of it is you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.720" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">where you stand is is what you see as</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.470" style="s2">I suppose that&#39;s the part that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.760" end="00:10:55.420" style="s2">disturbing the sort of implicit</p>

<p begin="00:14:47.779" end="00:14:52.009" style="s2">know here the same and so we were</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.820" end="00:17:41.780" style="s2">crisis began it was not something that</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.040" end="00:17:49.040" style="s2">but yeah the people who aren&#39;t used to</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:49.520" style="s2">thinking quantitatively don&#39;t even</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:04.550" style="s2">yeah and if it doubles nine times what</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.780" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">do we have right these don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.550" end="00:18:08.630" style="s2">way so you&#39;re right it&#39;s probably</p>

<p begin="00:18:13.640" end="00:18:16.700" style="s2">like this and then particularly if</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.380" end="00:18:26.360" style="s2">deal this is just the flu plus then but</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.740" end="00:18:28.640" style="s2">you know they don&#39;t look out looking for</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.360" end="00:18:30.230" style="s2">signals elsewhere absolutely no I think</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.980" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">of which were extraordinarily functional</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:41.480" style="s2">we came out the other side with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:44.360" style="s2">say an expanded public education system</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.480" end="00:20:47.510" style="s2">you know we built the modern state</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.360" end="00:20:48.890" style="s2">university as part of that so no one</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.510" end="00:20:50.690" style="s2">would say World War two was a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.890" end="00:20:53.750" style="s2">you know would prefer it not to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.690" end="00:20:55.970" style="s2">happened but what we did with that with</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.750" end="00:20:58.700" style="s2">some imagination was was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.970" end="00:21:01.040" style="s2">remarkable so I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m all in favor</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.040" end="00:21:06.740" style="s2">I&#39;m also in favor of maybe asking it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.250" end="00:21:08.870" style="s2">know in a positive sense to say well you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.740" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">know what do we want coming out the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.870" end="00:21:13.940" style="s2">other side yeah absolutely agree that</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.800" style="s2">there are huge numbers of positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.940" end="00:21:17.660" style="s2">possibilities are also some negatives</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.800" end="00:21:19.220" style="s2">but hey let other people dwell on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.660" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">negative let&#39;s think about the positive</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.220" end="00:21:25.640" style="s2">one so do you have some positive ideas</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:29.120" style="s2">let me think for a second here Jim you</p>

<p begin="00:25:43.299" end="00:25:49.220" style="s2">not just technically about what the fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.840" end="00:25:51.799" style="s2">that you know you and I are shedding</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.220" end="00:25:53.270" style="s2">terabytes of data a day I love it that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:29.899" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">also hugely subject to abuse and all</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.070" end="00:26:37.549" style="s2">kinds of way so to make us think about</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.549" end="00:26:41.720" style="s2">is frankly more realistic than though</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.379" end="00:28:02.100" style="s2">zoom&#39; than they did in person the kids</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.299" end="00:28:04.529" style="s2">are way more willing to ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.100" end="00:28:06.299" style="s2">they seem much more engaged and of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.529" end="00:28:07.799" style="s2">course I make them keep the video on so</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.299" end="00:28:10.350" style="s2">I can tell if they&#39;re paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.799" end="00:28:12.779" style="s2">or not I&#39;m not sure I want to go back to</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.119" end="00:28:39.960" style="s2">so let me let me let me follow up on</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.360" end="00:28:53.580" style="s2">obviously canceled and I was like wait I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.860" end="00:28:56.659" style="s2">now have like four days to do something</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.580" end="00:28:58.549" style="s2">else and you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.659" end="00:29:02.749" style="s2">I was gonna give four hours of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.549" end="00:29:04.519" style="s2">max maybe so you know that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.749" end="00:29:06.379" style="s2">pretty inefficient way to use time and</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.519" end="00:29:08.149" style="s2">secondly use Karma</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.379" end="00:29:10.639" style="s2">but let&#39;s flip it around and say okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.149" end="00:29:14.059" style="s2">fine we we stop all of our useless</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.639" end="00:29:16.669" style="s2">travel so what happens instead right</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.059" end="00:29:20.029" style="s2">what what do we do with you know what</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.669" end="00:29:23.059" style="s2">does the you know frequent-flyer gag do</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.029" end="00:29:25.220" style="s2">with all that spare time what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.059" end="00:29:27.769" style="s2">if we&#39;re not you know flying to give</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.220" end="00:29:29.749" style="s2">talks every month or flying for business</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.769" end="00:29:31.820" style="s2">meetings every month what what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.749" end="00:29:33.470" style="s2">with all that time that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.820" end="00:29:35.299" style="s2">question hopefully we use it to improve</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.470" end="00:29:36.710" style="s2">the world or improve our business or</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.299" end="00:29:39.440" style="s2">improve our research or improve our</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.710" end="00:29:41.599" style="s2">marriages but on the other hand we might</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.440" end="00:29:44.809" style="s2">spend it smoking dope and playing video</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.599" end="00:29:47.359" style="s2">games it&#39;s up to us it&#39;s yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.809" end="00:29:50.029" style="s2">there&#39;s I know that I think the zoom I</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.359" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know you know the zoom area is I</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.029" end="00:29:54.950" style="s2">mean from the point of view of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:58.759" style="s2">educator you can run a seminar on a</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.950" end="00:30:02.659" style="s2">computer and honestly you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.759" end="00:30:04.549" style="s2">miss much you know I used to take</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.659" end="00:30:06.440" style="s2">classes at Saint John&#39;s back in Santa Fe</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.549" end="00:30:08.090" style="s2">which I love it&#39;s you know that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.440" end="00:30:11.419" style="s2">sit in a seminar for three hours and</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.090" end="00:30:13.549" style="s2">focus intently but you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.419" end="00:30:14.809" style="s2">like we&#39;re not touching each other we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.549" end="00:30:17.419" style="s2">just sitting in chairs around a table</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.809" end="00:30:19.429" style="s2">there&#39;s again with a you know slightly</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.419" end="00:30:22.789" style="s2">better interface I&#39;m not sure we need it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.429" end="00:30:25.159" style="s2">to be there in person but then what does</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.789" end="00:30:26.330" style="s2">that do Jamie we&#39;re we&#39;re gonna do all</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.159" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">the real estate that&#39;s owned by the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.330" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">universities that make it to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:33.499" style="s2">homeless shelters really fancy really</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:40.429" style="s2">fancy expensive ones that have banging</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.499" end="00:30:42.289" style="s2">pipes right I think these are examples</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.429" end="00:30:44.359" style="s2">of potential histories that things could</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.289" end="00:30:45.679" style="s2">change in a fairly major way because we</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.359" end="00:30:49.460" style="s2">think about these fancy universities</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.679" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">that we a lot of us went to you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.460" end="00:30:52.729" style="s2">they&#39;re now one like what the hell they</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:55.070" style="s2">cost two hundred and fifty three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.729" end="00:30:57.320" style="s2">thousand dollars a year for a four-year</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.320" end="00:31:03.109" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll this will also provide a</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.690" end="00:31:05.269" style="s2">way to rethink all of that so okay one</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.109" end="00:31:06.739" style="s2">thing I predict is Harvard&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.269" end="00:31:08.509" style="s2">tuition will not drop</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.739" end="00:31:10.060" style="s2">okay that&#39;s Harvard Harvard won&#39;t but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.509" end="00:31:11.680" style="s2">you know it&#39;s always been we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.060" end="00:31:13.540" style="s2">curve can you get away with hosing</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.680" end="00:31:15.970" style="s2">people so that you can build up a twenty</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.540" end="00:31:17.590" style="s2">billion dollar endowment right and it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.970" end="00:31:19.300" style="s2">falls off pretty quickly but you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.590" end="00:31:21.340" style="s2">today it&#39;s like a hundred places they</p>
