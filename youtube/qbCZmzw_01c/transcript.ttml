<p begin="00:00:58.109" end="00:01:03.899" style="s2">really of the last three centuries that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">I think is really important for us to</p>

<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">really powerfully which is that as a set</p>

<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:15.950" style="s2">we can see by looking at this graph is</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.290" end="00:03:18.049" style="s2">that we have already overshot several of</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.950" end="00:03:21.019" style="s2">these planetary boundaries and we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.049" end="00:03:24.410" style="s2">currently at risk of a planetary scale</p>

<p begin="00:04:04.100" end="00:04:09.290" style="s2">planetary civilization so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:11.660" style="s2">that in a whole system level we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.290" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">destabilized many aspects of the planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.660" end="00:04:17.269" style="s2">and it&#39;s human cultural systems or the</p>

<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:32.940" style="s2">effect on the earth overall I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.010" end="00:04:33.930" style="s2">offer a very provocative idea which I</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">state this way</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.930" end="00:04:40.200" style="s2">what if behavioral flexibility is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:43.460" style="s2">root cause of the Earth&#39;s ecological</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.200" end="00:04:45.750" style="s2">crisis and normally we hear things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.460" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">climate change is caused by the burning</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.750" end="00:04:50.490" style="s2">of fossil fuels but that doesn&#39;t go deep</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:52.680" style="s2">enough to the root causes so let&#39;s dig</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.490" end="00:04:53.670" style="s2">into this for a moment and I&#39;ll share</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:57.540" style="s2">with you what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.670" end="00:04:59.910" style="s2">what is behavioral flexibility well if</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.540" end="00:05:01.950" style="s2">you were to ask a psychologist to look</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.910" end="00:05:05.370" style="s2">at these three different images shown</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.950" end="00:05:09.210" style="s2">here and ask them how flexible is each</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.370" end="00:05:11.670" style="s2">of these objects or organisms for</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.210" end="00:05:13.920" style="s2">changing its behavior you look at a rock</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.670" end="00:05:17.850" style="s2">which is in the bottom left and you say</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.920" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">well a rock can have some behavior if it</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.850" end="00:05:21.870" style="s2">comes loose it will follow the path of</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:24.120" style="s2">gravity and it will fall until it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.870" end="00:05:26.940" style="s2">settles to a new position at a lower</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.120" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">elevation but it is incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.940" end="00:05:32.669" style="s2">changing its behavior by its own actions</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:35.790" style="s2">so it has basically zero behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.669" end="00:05:37.260" style="s2">flexibility in turtle to itself whereas</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.790" end="00:05:40.260" style="s2">if you go to the right and say this</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.260" end="00:05:42.930" style="s2">plant the plant has some behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.260" end="00:05:45.240" style="s2">flexibility because if you have a light</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.930" end="00:05:48.810" style="s2">source like if it&#39;s facing toward the</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.240" end="00:05:50.250" style="s2">Sun on the left then the vines as</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.810" end="00:05:52.380" style="s2">they&#39;re growing will reach in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.250" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">direction of the Sun but if you turn the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.380" end="00:05:57.660" style="s2">plant around the growth will move in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:05:59.400" style="s2">opposite direction and it has a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.660" end="00:06:01.890" style="s2">limited flexibility to change its</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.400" end="00:06:04.590" style="s2">behavior in response to changing</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.890" end="00:06:06.600" style="s2">environmental conditions but aside from</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.590" end="00:06:09.960" style="s2">this very limited behavioral flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.600" end="00:06:12.120" style="s2">it&#39;s still pretty limited overall and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.960" end="00:06:14.700" style="s2">what it can do whereas if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.120" end="00:06:18.320" style="s2">this Mouse as laboratory mapped on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.700" end="00:06:20.550" style="s2">right these animals are famous in</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.320" end="00:06:22.870" style="s2">psychology for all of the social</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.550" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">experiments that can be conducted</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.870" end="00:06:28.690" style="s2">to see how they change their behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:32.139" style="s2">because the complex brain of a mammal</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.690" end="00:06:34.060" style="s2">like a rodent or a lab rat is able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.139" end="00:06:36.639" style="s2">learn new things from its experiences</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:39.190" style="s2">and then change its behaviors as it</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.639" end="00:06:41.020" style="s2">learns about new environments so this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.190" end="00:06:44.050" style="s2">idea of behavioral flexibility can be</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.020" end="00:06:46.930" style="s2">thought of as a range of internal</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.050" end="00:06:49.510" style="s2">capacities for an organism to change its</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.930" end="00:06:52.090" style="s2">behaviors within changing environments</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.510" end="00:06:54.729" style="s2">or to change the environment and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.090" end="00:06:58.030" style="s2">adapt to the new environment by changing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.729" end="00:07:00.280" style="s2">its behavior now if we look at humans</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.030" end="00:07:03.130" style="s2">what we can see is that throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.280" end="00:07:05.620" style="s2">evolution of our ancestral line of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.130" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">hominids that behavioral flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.620" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">increased with growing social and</p>

<p begin="00:10:58.490" end="00:11:03.589" style="s2">we can see that the human capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.279" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">alter the entire planet was achieved</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.589" end="00:11:11.990" style="s2">sometime in the last 100 years if not</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:14.660" style="s2">before so if we accept the behavioral</p>

<p begin="00:11:21.470" end="00:11:29.000" style="s2">way to avert disaster what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.089" end="00:11:32.210" style="s2">this is that we can use our knowledge of</p>

<p begin="00:12:13.160" end="00:12:17.810" style="s2">became field sites for a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.170" end="00:12:21.110" style="s2">evolution research so think about what a</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.810" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">field site is an anthropology a field</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.110" end="00:12:27.170" style="s2">site is a place that a researcher goes</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.640" end="00:12:39.110" style="s2">see what&#39;s there but the important thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.920" end="00:12:42.920" style="s2">is that the field site remains a place</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.110" end="00:12:44.779" style="s2">of longitudinal or ongoing study to set</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.920" end="00:12:47.600" style="s2">up baseline measurements and track</p>

<p begin="00:13:06.780" end="00:13:12.960" style="s2">about applied cultural evolution this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.630" end="00:13:15.390" style="s2">what I mean that we&#39;d take the rigor of</p>

<p begin="00:13:15.390" end="00:13:22.170" style="s2">bring it to the practices of social</p>

<p begin="00:13:27.930" end="00:13:33.300" style="s2">in the world today so let me give a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:36.180" style="s2">couple examples to show that this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.300" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">really a new idea even though what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.890" end="00:13:45.270" style="s2">can understand it through this lens and</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.570" end="00:13:48.420" style="s2">a great example to start with is lista</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.270" end="00:13:50.400" style="s2">is the field of public health so over</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.420" end="00:13:53.010" style="s2">the last hundred hundred and fifty years</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.430" end="00:14:04.670" style="s2">transparent and accountable and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.590" end="00:14:06.890" style="s2">more so fields like prevention science</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.640" end="00:14:26.310" style="s2">of areas that have a huge body of</p>

<p begin="00:14:30.270" end="00:14:35.460" style="s2">effectively similarly if we look at</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.480" end="00:14:51.180" style="s2">research is the study of social learning</p>

<p begin="00:15:11.300" end="00:15:17.780" style="s2">individual community and larger societal</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.600" end="00:15:20.390" style="s2">scales so education in this broad way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.780" end="00:15:22.720" style="s2">understanding it is an area where a huge</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.390" end="00:15:25.780" style="s2">amount has been learned about how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.720" end="00:15:29.750" style="s2">apply cultural evolution at</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.780" end="00:15:31.610" style="s2">institutional scales another area that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.750" end="00:15:33.350" style="s2">maybe a little bit more questionable in</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.610" end="00:15:36.280" style="s2">its ethics which brings up the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.350" end="00:15:38.660" style="s2">importance of developing clear and</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.280" end="00:15:41.150" style="s2">robust ethical frameworks for</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.660" end="00:15:43.640" style="s2">participatory design is the area of</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.150" end="00:15:46.010" style="s2">marketing so in the early days marketing</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.640" end="00:15:48.470" style="s2">was mostly about the manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.010" end="00:15:51.380" style="s2">people&#39;s innate psychological capacities</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.470" end="00:15:53.960" style="s2">in order to sell products or to build</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.380" end="00:15:56.000" style="s2">brand identities but over time it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.960" end="00:15:57.800" style="s2">very evident that marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.000" end="00:16:01.130" style="s2">advertising have been extremely</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.800" end="00:16:03.950" style="s2">effective at changing the pathway of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.130" end="00:16:06.740" style="s2">cultural evolution for entire societies</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.950" end="00:16:09.170" style="s2">and quite honestly the entire global</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.740" end="00:16:11.300" style="s2">economy so if we think of marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.170" end="00:16:13.310" style="s2">advertising as areas of applied cultural</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.300" end="00:16:15.530" style="s2">evolution we can see that there are a</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.310" end="00:16:18.920" style="s2">lot of tools and frameworks that we can</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.530" end="00:16:22.400" style="s2">draw upon that are effective at large</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.920" end="00:16:25.100" style="s2">scales so now specifically applied to</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.400" end="00:16:27.380" style="s2">bio economics we can apply things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.100" end="00:16:29.390" style="s2">the capital Institute&#39;s framework for</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.380" end="00:16:31.250" style="s2">regenerative economics which is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.390" end="00:16:33.830" style="s2">synthesis of knowledge about living</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.250" end="00:16:37.880" style="s2">systems as it&#39;s applied to how humans</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.830" end="00:16:40.700" style="s2">might design or economic systems we now</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.880" end="00:16:43.820" style="s2">know a great deal about the biological</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.700" end="00:16:45.650" style="s2">organisms and ecological functions of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.820" end="00:16:48.620" style="s2">networks of relationships between</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.650" end="00:16:51.230" style="s2">species and various scales from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.620" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">study of living systems when you add the</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.230" end="00:16:57.020" style="s2">tools of complexity research and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">tools of evolution then we begin to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.020" end="00:17:03.410" style="s2">the capacity to design economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:05.570" style="s2">that have the living systems capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.410" end="00:17:07.850" style="s2">regenerate themselves from moment to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.570" end="00:17:10.430" style="s2">moment and this is something that shows</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.850" end="00:17:14.120" style="s2">great promise for the future as an area</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.430" end="00:17:17.569" style="s2">of applied cultural evolution in my own</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.120" end="00:17:20.269" style="s2">work I have a very specific and the</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.569" end="00:17:22.579" style="s2">ambitious goal which is to help people</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.269" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">understand that if we join forces</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.579" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">between all of the learning centers</p>

<p begin="00:17:32.090" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">about how to guide social change that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.929" end="00:17:41.120" style="s2">can direct it toward shared planetary</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">scale goals for example in this map you</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.120" end="00:17:47.330" style="s2">can see all of the degraded soils on</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.580" end="00:17:51.529" style="s2">earth and what it shows us is a target</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.330" end="00:17:53.690" style="s2">that if we were to regenerate and end</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.529" end="00:17:55.909" style="s2">the degradation restore the health of</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.909" end="00:18:00.379" style="s2">scale we can bring ourselves back within</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.340" end="00:18:02.149" style="s2">the planetary boundaries of the</p>

<p begin="00:18:09.320" end="00:18:13.580" style="s2">part of the work that I&#39;m doing is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.299" end="00:18:16.669" style="s2">try to coordinate this through the idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.580" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">of creating bio regional scale economic</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.669" end="00:18:22.129" style="s2">systems that organize themselves with</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:24.590" style="s2">local learning centers that map out and</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.049" end="00:18:34.549" style="s2">colors this is the work that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.539" end="00:18:37.250" style="s2">now at the Center for Applied Koechlin</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.549" end="00:18:38.899" style="s2">evolution and we&#39;re doing it in what we</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.250" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">call the design Institute for</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.899" end="00:18:43.700" style="s2">regenerating Earth which is just</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:47.059" style="s2">beginning and has a lot of work still to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.700" end="00:18:50.059" style="s2">be done but the idea is to leave a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.059" end="00:18:52.669" style="s2">collaborative tapestry of learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.059" end="00:18:55.070" style="s2">centers across the planet let&#39;s share</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.669" end="00:18:57.289" style="s2">this vision of regenerating the entire</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.070" end="00:18:59.029" style="s2">Earth so if this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.289" end="00:19:01.129" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in and you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.029" end="00:19:04.460" style="s2">get involved well that&#39;s something I</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.129" end="00:19:06.830" style="s2">would be very happy to talk about I like</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.460" end="00:19:09.919" style="s2">to end on a personal note and say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.830" end="00:19:13.070" style="s2">we owe it to future generations to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.919" end="00:19:15.110" style="s2">the very best we can to safeguard our</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.360" end="00:19:24.950" style="s2">so here&#39;s a picture of me holding my</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.560" end="00:19:31.280" style="s2">orange of this picture but I just wanted</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.020" end="00:19:33.710" style="s2">to say that this is something that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.280" end="00:19:36.560" style="s2">take very personally but I hold in my</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.710" end="00:19:39.590" style="s2">heart as a sacred purpose for my own</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.560" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">work and building by economic systems</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.590" end="00:19:44.450" style="s2">what can we generate the earth so if</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:46.610" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in talking with me</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.450" end="00:19:48.860" style="s2">about any of this or getting involved in</p>
