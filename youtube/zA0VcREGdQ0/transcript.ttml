<p begin="00:00:05.390" end="00:00:10.200" style="s2">hi everybody we are putting this film</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:12.540" style="s2">out to announce the rebel ISM festival</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.200" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">which is happening on the 30th and 31st</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.540" end="00:00:17.490" style="s2">of May and David and I are obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">in the same place so we&#39;re recording</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.490" end="00:00:21.630" style="s2">this remotely so the festival was</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:23.400" style="s2">originally going to be in person in</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:25.980" style="s2">London and we&#39;ve now brought it online</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.400" end="00:00:28.470" style="s2">we&#39;ve also made it free so it&#39;s turned</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.980" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">into something I think even bigger and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.470" end="00:00:32.820" style="s2">more ambitious than the in-person</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">festival and this film is really to</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.820" end="00:00:37.050" style="s2">introduce some of the speakers and also</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">to to introduce the the ethos and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.050" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">the whole point of the festival and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">what makes it maybe a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.950" style="s2">different to to a regular online event</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:46.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve got all the people that we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.950" end="00:00:47.520" style="s2">previously for the festival including</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.020" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">Daniel SH macton burger</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.520" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">Jamba Vicky Nora Bateson who we&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">added another couple of speakers</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">including Douglas rushkoff</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:01:01.379" style="s2">and Jamie wheel we designed the festival</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">to be really participatory so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.379" end="00:01:04.970" style="s2">just about the intellectual side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">also about the the practical side of</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.970" end="00:01:09.810" style="s2">learning new skills levelling up</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.439" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">improving our discernment improving our</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.810" end="00:01:15.750" style="s2">focus and our awareness so with that in</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:16.920" style="s2">mind we have 20 odd workshops with lots</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.750" end="00:01:19.590" style="s2">and lots of different practices</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.920" end="00:01:22.170" style="s2">so there&#39;s mindfulness there&#39;s breath</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.590" end="00:01:25.170" style="s2">work there&#39;s discussion groups</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.170" end="00:01:26.009" style="s2">there&#39;s circling we&#39;ve designed it so</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.170" end="00:01:28.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.009" end="00:01:30.280" style="s2">choose-your-own-adventure format</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.630" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">I&#39;m right now in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.280" end="00:01:34.390" style="s2">pandemic and the systemic crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:36.520" style="s2">we&#39;ve also talked about what we found is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.390" end="00:01:41.440" style="s2">these skills become hugely important for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.520" end="00:01:42.850" style="s2">us to navigate and if you prefer not to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.440" end="00:01:44.500" style="s2">participate but you&#39;d like to watch</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.850" end="00:01:46.869" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be streaming sections of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.500" end="00:01:52.270" style="s2">the festival live to this channel to our</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.869" end="00:01:54.070" style="s2">YouTube channel so there&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.270" end="00:01:55.630" style="s2">different tracks so three different</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.070" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">themes were exploring throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.630" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">festival and they are sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:03.550" style="s2">meaning and imagined futures</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:05.560" style="s2">sense-making is something we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.550" end="00:02:07.300" style="s2">about a lot how do we make sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.560" end="00:02:09.220" style="s2">world in a world where it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.300" end="00:02:11.050" style="s2">difficult now to trust information and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.220" end="00:02:12.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of it this is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.050" end="00:02:14.860" style="s2">absolutely essential skill because if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.910" end="00:02:16.180" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to make sense we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.860" end="00:02:17.739" style="s2">know where we&#39;re going and the person</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.180" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">who&#39;s probably spoken most about</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.739" end="00:02:21.340" style="s2">sense-making on the channel and most</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:22.720" style="s2">eloquently is Daniel Shmack Tim Berger</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.340" end="00:02:24.370" style="s2">who&#39;s going to be at the festival we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.720" end="00:02:26.590" style="s2">making more and more consequential</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.370" end="00:02:29.230" style="s2">choices with worse and worse sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.590" end="00:02:31.989" style="s2">making to inform those choices which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.230" end="00:02:34.320" style="s2">kind of running increasingly fast</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.989" end="00:02:36.790" style="s2">through the woods increasingly blind</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.320" end="00:02:39.370" style="s2">from what I have seen of rebel wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.790" end="00:02:41.049" style="s2">this is probably the strange attractor</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.370" end="00:02:42.940" style="s2">of what is bringing everybody to watch</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.049" end="00:02:44.440" style="s2">it is people who are trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.940" end="00:02:47.769" style="s2">sense of the world better themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.440" end="00:02:49.750" style="s2">are trying to find sources of content of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.769" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">other other people that have been trying</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.750" end="00:02:53.230" style="s2">to make sense of it well another key</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:55.660" style="s2">topic we&#39;ve talked about in the channel</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.230" end="00:02:57.760" style="s2">from the beginning is meaning and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.660" end="00:02:59.440" style="s2">more than anyone else John drove a key</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.760" end="00:03:01.030" style="s2">has delved into what he calls the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.440" end="00:03:02.769" style="s2">meaning crisis and he has a whole series</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.030" end="00:03:05.049" style="s2">called awakening from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.769" end="00:03:06.730" style="s2">so John is going to be speaking of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.049" end="00:03:09.160" style="s2">festival as well and just play a quick</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.730" end="00:03:10.890" style="s2">clip at the core of our cognition or our</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.160" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">ability to make meaning it&#39;s central to</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.890" end="00:03:15.459" style="s2">communication problem solving the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:18.700" style="s2">problem that&#39;s happened for us is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.459" end="00:03:22.540" style="s2">the worldview within which our wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.700" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">traditions arose has been significantly</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.540" end="00:03:26.650" style="s2">undermined for a host of very</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">interconnected and complex historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:29.650" style="s2">reasons that have to do with things like</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.000" end="00:03:31.600" style="s2">the process of reformation the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.650" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">of the scientific worldview so for a</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.600" end="00:03:36.609" style="s2">whole host of historical reasons we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.740" style="s2">a worldview in which we as meaning</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.609" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">makers don&#39;t belong and if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.740" end="00:03:41.560" style="s2">watching the channel over the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:43.840" style="s2">couple of months you might have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.560" end="00:03:45.640" style="s2">we put out some pieces looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.840" end="00:03:48.490" style="s2">current crisis we&#39;re in from a systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.640" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">level and pointing out that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.490" end="00:03:52.750" style="s2">system theorists for the first people to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.170" end="00:03:55.000" style="s2">point out that our systems are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.750" end="00:03:56.380" style="s2">incredibly fragile and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.000" end="00:03:59.050" style="s2">Nora Bateson who has a really</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.380" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">interesting take on what how systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.050" end="00:04:02.620" style="s2">work and why it&#39;s important that we take</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:04.540" style="s2">that that wider view the curse of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.620" end="00:04:06.430" style="s2">Cassandra is to be able to see the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.540" end="00:04:12.880" style="s2">future but to have no one believe you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.430" end="00:04:16.590" style="s2">and I think e if you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.880" end="00:04:19.209" style="s2">multiple systems simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.590" end="00:04:20.650" style="s2">complexity thinkers have been actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.209" end="00:04:24.010" style="s2">and systems thinkers have been saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.650" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">for decades I mean not just right before</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.010" end="00:04:32.650" style="s2">this but for decades that there is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">incredible destructive fragility and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.650" end="00:04:37.210" style="s2">just one of our systems like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:39.700" style="s2">just the education system it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.210" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">the economy it&#39;s not just the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.700" end="00:04:46.120" style="s2">system it&#39;s not just the political</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:50.200" style="s2">system it&#39;s it&#39;s not just that the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.120" end="00:04:53.260" style="s2">way technology is in our lives it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.200" end="00:04:56.560" style="s2">of those systems simultaneously and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.260" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">importantly their fragility is in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.560" end="00:05:02.680" style="s2">relationship between them so the third</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:03.940" style="s2">track is called imagined futures and one</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.680" end="00:05:05.200" style="s2">of the high points of the festival</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.940" end="00:05:07.150" style="s2">something we&#39;re both really looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.200" end="00:05:10.270" style="s2">forward to is going to be a first-ever</p>
