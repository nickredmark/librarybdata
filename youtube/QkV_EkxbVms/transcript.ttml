<p begin="00:01:26.150" end="00:01:30.260" style="s2">philosophy on that and has written books</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.520" end="00:01:33.860" style="s2">on the topic which we might get into a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.260" end="00:01:39.140" style="s2">bit and our topic today is understanding</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.860" end="00:01:40.940" style="s2">what intelligence is what IQ is and EQ</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.140" end="00:01:42.470" style="s2">and other kind of metrics related to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.940" end="00:01:46.220" style="s2">intelligence where they&#39;re good where</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.470" end="00:01:47.510" style="s2">they&#39;re not adequate what we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.220" end="00:01:49.370" style="s2">talking about when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.510" end="00:01:51.350" style="s2">intelligence what&#39;s actually meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.370" end="00:01:53.780" style="s2">here what are better ways of defining it</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.350" end="00:01:56.420" style="s2">and assessing it and then how much of it</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.780" end="00:01:57.830" style="s2">is fixed how much is changeable and what</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.420" end="00:02:01.340" style="s2">are the what do we know about how to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.830" end="00:02:03.409" style="s2">actually advance and develop what is</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.340" end="00:02:05.990" style="s2">actually worth developing here so this</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.409" end="00:02:08.209" style="s2">is a topic that I don&#39;t know anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.990" end="00:02:10.369" style="s2">knows more about that the depth of the</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.369" end="00:02:15.170" style="s2">things was a founder of a really</p>

<p begin="00:02:19.670" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">development across lots of lines looking</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.680" end="00:02:26.420" style="s2">at someone&#39;s development in different</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:28.220" style="s2">aspects of cognition their development</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.420" end="00:02:29.810" style="s2">and ethics and their epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.220" end="00:02:31.340" style="s2">their moral reasoning and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.810" end="00:02:32.780" style="s2">assess those things how does the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.340" end="00:02:34.310" style="s2">assessment affect the nature of what</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:36.739" style="s2">we&#39;re assessing all like that so Zach</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.310" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">thank you for being here today with us</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.739" end="00:02:45.430" style="s2">I&#39;m so excited Daniel there&#39;s like no</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:48.530" style="s2">conversation I&#39;d rather be so</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.430" end="00:02:52.550" style="s2">intelligence let&#39;s just dive right in I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.530" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">think there are probably no scores that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.550" end="00:02:58.040" style="s2">people have identified with as being</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:03:04.819" style="s2">important metrics of their capacity than</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:07.670" style="s2">IQ maybe so I&#39;m curious for you to just</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.819" end="00:03:10.100" style="s2">start with the education of us how did</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.670" end="00:03:12.650" style="s2">the IQ development how did that score</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.100" end="00:03:16.190" style="s2">come about what does it actually measure</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.650" end="00:03:17.810" style="s2">how does that relate to the total</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.190" end="00:03:21.230" style="s2">picture of what intelligence is what are</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.810" end="00:03:22.910" style="s2">multiple lines of intelligence and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.230" end="00:03:24.290" style="s2">should we think about intelligence I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.910" end="00:03:27.160" style="s2">think everyone has a kind of intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.290" end="00:03:29.540" style="s2">sense of something that relates to</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.160" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">processing speed and memory and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.540" end="00:03:35.780" style="s2">computational power that is kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:39.230" style="s2">distinction to artistic inclination or</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.780" end="00:03:41.530" style="s2">interpersonal inclination so start us</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.230" end="00:03:43.250" style="s2">off dive in how should we think about</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.530" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">intelligence what are the problems that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.250" end="00:03:47.239" style="s2">we think about it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.410" end="00:03:50.090" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting you start with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.239" end="00:03:51.650" style="s2">notion of score is that&#39;s really one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.090" end="00:03:54.440" style="s2">the hearts of the issues here is that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.650" end="00:03:57.079" style="s2">have connected intelligence which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.440" end="00:03:58.880" style="s2">something that goes on in the mind with</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.079" end="00:04:00.890" style="s2">a particular instrument right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.880" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">been used to detect intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.890" end="00:04:06.410" style="s2">so-called err supposedly detect</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:07.400" style="s2">intelligence for a very long time and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.410" end="00:04:09.100" style="s2">I think one of the things we need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.400" end="00:04:11.600" style="s2">think about the IQ test and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.100" end="00:04:13.130" style="s2">disentangling that a little bit from our</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.600" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">conceptions of intelligence because</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.130" end="00:04:18.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve ratified and simplified and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:20.690" style="s2">think drastically oversimplified and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.100" end="00:04:22.400" style="s2">there&#39;s many great histories of IQ</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.690" end="00:04:24.650" style="s2">testing I really like Stephen Jay Gould</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.400" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">great work called the MIS measure of man</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.650" end="00:04:28.879" style="s2">and you see from reading this book that</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.020" end="00:04:31.129" style="s2">the IQ test was</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.879" end="00:04:33.649" style="s2">not an instrument of science but an</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.129" end="00:04:36.979" style="s2">instrument of bureaucracy and had to do</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.649" end="00:04:39.559" style="s2">with the quantitative excuse me the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.979" end="00:04:41.479" style="s2">socio political history of quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.559" end="00:04:44.539" style="s2">objectivity I said this has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.479" end="00:04:48.050" style="s2">the use of numbers in the manipulation</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.539" end="00:04:50.179" style="s2">of people and this is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.050" end="00:04:51.889" style="s2">aspect of modernity and it was hugely</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.179" end="00:04:55.059" style="s2">liberating and things like public health</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.889" end="00:04:58.009" style="s2">and sense is taking in other areas where</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.059" end="00:05:01.369" style="s2">mathematics liberated us into this new</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.009" end="00:05:04.039" style="s2">realm of social engineering but of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.369" end="00:05:05.719" style="s2">course every step forward as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.039" end="00:05:11.689" style="s2">dialectic to these kinds of developments</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.719" end="00:05:14.389" style="s2">and so what you find with the IQ test is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.689" end="00:05:19.729" style="s2">that in France turn a century you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.389" end="00:05:22.159" style="s2">late 18-hundreds Binet was tasked by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.729" end="00:05:24.860" style="s2">French government to create a test that</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.159" end="00:05:27.679" style="s2">could be used to basically keep certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.860" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">types of kids out of schools and given a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.679" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">special attention so Binet was someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:34.759" style="s2">who specialized in a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:36.649" style="s2">psychological fields but especially the</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.759" end="00:05:39.169" style="s2">rehabilitation of the learning disabled</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.649" end="00:05:42.259" style="s2">so the IQ test was really just a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.169" end="00:05:45.110" style="s2">gross sorting mechanism created in</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.259" end="00:05:47.659" style="s2">France to find those kids who needed</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.110" end="00:05:49.399" style="s2">special attention and Binet was very</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.659" end="00:05:52.849" style="s2">explicit and Stephen Jay Gould gives us</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.399" end="00:05:56.569" style="s2">beautiful account of Benes dismay and</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.849" end="00:05:58.159" style="s2">concern at the reification of IQ he</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.569" end="00:06:02.479" style="s2">thought this was just an instrument just</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.159" end="00:06:05.479" style="s2">to use to sort kids in a useful way in</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.479" end="00:06:07.099" style="s2">the public interest it&#39;s not in any way</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.479" end="00:06:08.719" style="s2">a theory by the nature of the mind or</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.099" end="00:06:10.939" style="s2">about the nature of intelligence that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.719" end="00:06:14.269" style="s2">whole idea that the IQ test measures</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.939" end="00:06:16.099" style="s2">this intelligent kind of general</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.269" end="00:06:17.539" style="s2">intelligence which is then genetically</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.099" end="00:06:20.509" style="s2">transmitted not all idea came from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.539" end="00:06:22.300" style="s2">Americans who imported the IQ test at</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.509" end="00:06:24.409" style="s2">the beginning of the First World War and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.300" end="00:06:28.039" style="s2">at the same time traded the</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.409" end="00:06:30.459" style="s2">multiple-choice test and move we got</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.039" end="00:06:33.349" style="s2">kind of large-scale industrial-strength</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.459" end="00:06:36.769" style="s2">standardized testing and that&#39;s a gift</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.349" end="00:06:39.979" style="s2">of the kind of world war one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.769" end="00:06:41.970" style="s2">scramble the preamble to World War one</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.979" end="00:06:44.850" style="s2">scramble in America</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.970" end="00:06:46.320" style="s2">so what was first just an instrument</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.980" end="00:07:31.020" style="s2">not as theorized as it needs to be right</p>

<p begin="00:08:07.169" end="00:08:11.180" style="s2">one number and put it on the linear</p>

<p begin="00:08:17.720" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">oversimplification and so likewise you</p>

<p begin="00:08:22.880" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">right but it&#39;s a demi reality it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.410" end="00:08:30.150" style="s2">small round so the IQ test became this</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">and a truncated our thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.150" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">nature of intelligence and it became</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:37.289" style="s2">hypertrophy and a lot of people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:39.300" style="s2">realize that the IQ test was then</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.289" end="00:08:41.159" style="s2">created up and complicated a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.300" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">taken by the Educational Testing Service</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.159" end="00:08:48.180" style="s2">and made into the the SAT and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:50.070" style="s2">this long kind of continuous history of</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.180" end="00:08:52.770" style="s2">the use of these forms of quote</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.070" end="00:08:55.380" style="s2">intelligence testing not really for</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.380" end="00:08:59.580" style="s2">for the organization of educational</p>

<p begin="00:08:59.580" end="00:09:03.900" style="s2">like the army which was where the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.550" end="00:09:06.630" style="s2">large-scale standardized test was ever</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.900" end="00:09:09.480" style="s2">created it was for the army alpha 1 and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.630" end="00:09:11.700" style="s2">alpha 2 which were to sort the incoming</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.480" end="00:09:14.760" style="s2">millions into the American army for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.700" end="00:09:16.110" style="s2">world war 1 so that&#39;s kind of the brief</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.760" end="00:09:18.150" style="s2">history of where this instrument came</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.110" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">from and so I&#39;m not a big fan of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.150" end="00:09:20.730" style="s2">instrument itself now there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:22.410" style="s2">improvements to it we have these new</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.730" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">fangled lungs that raven matrices and</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.410" end="00:09:26.610" style="s2">some problems have been solved with</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:28.860" style="s2">objectivity and reliability which were</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.610" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">the first big concerns so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.860" end="00:09:33.030" style="s2">kind of skip that side piece but I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.280" style="s2">to talk about is the way that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.030" end="00:09:37.110" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of addicted to a simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.280" end="00:09:39.500" style="s2">way of thinking about intelligence right</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:43.020" style="s2">and actually many people have an allergy</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.500" end="00:09:46.680" style="s2">to thinking about it in a more complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.020" end="00:09:49.020" style="s2">way and you know Howard Gardner and Curt</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.680" end="00:09:50.730" style="s2">Fisher who I studied with at Harvard all</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.020" end="00:09:52.560" style="s2">they wanted to do was talk about it in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.730" end="00:09:54.510" style="s2">more complex way and they had very</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.560" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2">little interest in anything like general</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.510" end="00:09:59.160" style="s2">intelligence and thought it was actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:10:00.930" style="s2">a concept that was dangerous right</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.160" end="00:10:03.210" style="s2">Howard Gardner once said to me know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.930" end="00:10:06.210" style="s2">intelligence is the most political of</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.210" end="00:10:08.810" style="s2">all the psychological concepts right</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.210" end="00:10:13.500" style="s2">because it becomes the meritocracies</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.810" end="00:10:15.390" style="s2">kind of yardstick and so yeah so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.500" end="00:10:16.500" style="s2">a little bit of a preamble to like okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.390" end="00:10:19.440" style="s2">let&#39;s deliberate thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.500" end="00:10:22.080" style="s2">intelligence from the idea and start</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.440" end="00:10:23.550" style="s2">intelligence in a more complex way when</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.080" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">you say that the concept has been very</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.550" end="00:10:27.090" style="s2">reified obviously it has right even</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:31.080" style="s2">though it started out without a really</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.090" end="00:10:33.330" style="s2">clear philosophical foundation but let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.080" end="00:10:35.610" style="s2">take groups like Mensa right let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.330" end="00:10:38.190" style="s2">the way it&#39;s been used in military or</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.610" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">any other kind of institution not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.190" end="00:10:44.340" style="s2">for rooting out who is not qualified but</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">also who is qualified for higher level</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.340" end="00:10:48.810" style="s2">capacities you would think that if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t map in some way to reality the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.810" end="00:10:54.590" style="s2">concept wouldn&#39;t have withstood this</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:57.450" style="s2">much time so what is it measuring and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.590" end="00:10:59.400" style="s2">how does that correlate to reality and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.450" end="00:11:01.100" style="s2">then also what is it not measuring I</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.400" end="00:11:04.050" style="s2">would love to go in there a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.100" end="00:11:06.270" style="s2">yeah absolutely and like I said it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.050" end="00:11:08.040" style="s2">measuring something just like just like</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.270" end="00:11:08.860" style="s2">GDP is measuring something so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.040" end="00:11:11.500" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.860" end="00:11:13.480" style="s2">out of touch with reality it&#39;s at its</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.500" end="00:11:15.480" style="s2">revealing unreality in a way that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.480" end="00:11:18.520" style="s2">revealing as much as we could so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.480" end="00:11:21.490" style="s2">drastically oversimplifying it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.520" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">like taking a complex ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.490" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">giving it a single number when in fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:27.430" style="s2">there are many things happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:31.120" style="s2">ecosystem which could be given different</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.430" end="00:11:32.920" style="s2">numbers and so in some institutional</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.120" end="00:11:36.130" style="s2">context that&#39;s very valuable and first</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.920" end="00:11:37.720" style="s2">when you&#39;re for example starting a huge</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.130" end="00:11:39.550" style="s2">army from scratch with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.720" end="00:11:41.860" style="s2">American farm boys anyone to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.550" end="00:11:43.600" style="s2">like who could potentially be in general</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.860" end="00:11:45.970" style="s2">like it&#39;s very useful than a gross way</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.600" end="00:11:47.260" style="s2">to sort that and so this is important</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.970" end="00:11:49.960" style="s2">but when you start thinking about what</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.260" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">what then what does it measure yeah to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.960" end="00:11:55.810" style="s2">being in general well right and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:57.310" style="s2">what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m not sure this is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.810" end="00:11:58.540" style="s2">question then we have to go deeper and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.310" end="00:12:00.760" style="s2">think well then what&#39;s the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.540" end="00:12:03.190" style="s2">mind because what does it measure means</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.760" end="00:12:05.650" style="s2">well what&#39;s there to measure you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.190" end="00:12:07.830" style="s2">and so that&#39;s where we need to tell a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.650" end="00:12:10.690" style="s2">story about cognitive development and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.830" end="00:12:12.460" style="s2">about the nature of the mind and how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.690" end="00:12:14.650" style="s2">grows and what the nature of learning is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.460" end="00:12:18.010" style="s2">and what the nature of what we call</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.650" end="00:12:19.840" style="s2">intelligence actually is busting the dam</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.010" end="00:12:23.140" style="s2">in reality to get to the actual reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.840" end="00:12:25.660" style="s2">of intelligence so my favorite phrase of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.140" end="00:12:28.750" style="s2">Piaget is the idea that intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.660" end="00:12:30.370" style="s2">the grasp of consciousness right which</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.750" end="00:12:34.750" style="s2">is to say its intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.370" end="00:12:37.420" style="s2">consciousness operating world right and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.750" end="00:12:39.580" style="s2">so when we look at what intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.420" end="00:12:42.790" style="s2">what it has to do is it&#39;s these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.580" end="00:12:45.520" style="s2">skillful manipulation or operation first</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.790" end="00:12:47.380" style="s2">on the physical been on representations</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.520" end="00:12:49.990" style="s2">and on abstraction then on principles</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.380" end="00:12:53.350" style="s2">and actions right which is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.990" end="00:12:55.060" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to move physical objects</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.350" end="00:12:57.130" style="s2">around in a skillful way which humans</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.060" end="00:12:59.560" style="s2">have done since who knows how long</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.130" end="00:13:01.180" style="s2">millions of years all right but now</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.560" end="00:13:04.780" style="s2">we&#39;re moving around principles and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.180" end="00:13:06.490" style="s2">axioms of science in the skillful way so</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.780" end="00:13:10.090" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at a spectrum of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.490" end="00:13:13.000" style="s2">complexity that grows over time and you</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.090" end="00:13:14.680" style="s2">know the Piaget that was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.000" end="00:13:16.390" style="s2">chastised in your introduction in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.680" end="00:13:17.740" style="s2">psychology course that is not the actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.390" end="00:13:19.360" style="s2">Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.740" end="00:13:20.920" style="s2">and kurt fischer i think is probably one</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.360" end="00:13:22.540" style="s2">of the most important psychologists of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.920" end="00:13:24.660" style="s2">the 20th century in part because he kept</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.540" end="00:13:27.550" style="s2">the puget and vision of this</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.660" end="00:13:32.560" style="s2">hierarchical cognitive architecture that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.550" end="00:13:35.890" style="s2">emerges over time so what we look at IQ</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.560" end="00:13:38.260" style="s2">is in many ways a generalized if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.890" end="00:13:41.680" style="s2">want to go their capacity for building</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.260" end="00:13:43.450" style="s2">skills of this hierarchy right now what</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.680" end="00:13:45.160" style="s2">we&#39;re missing with a typical way of kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.450" end="00:13:46.660" style="s2">of capturing some of those skills and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.160" end="00:13:48.940" style="s2">saying those are valuable those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.660" end="00:13:50.860" style="s2">intelligence is that there&#39;s a very wide</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.940" end="00:13:53.770" style="s2">array of skills like huge number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.860" end="00:13:55.480" style="s2">skills that you can build and only some</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.770" end="00:13:57.220" style="s2">of those Mac with what we measure on IQ</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.480" end="00:13:59.260" style="s2">so there are many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.220" end="00:14:01.540" style="s2">radically skilled at building really</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.260" end="00:14:04.630" style="s2">quickly skills up this hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.540" end="00:14:06.070" style="s2">skill they&#39;re just not this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.630" end="00:14:08.530" style="s2">stuff that we measure and value on IQ</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.070" end="00:14:10.780" style="s2">tests so that&#39;s kind of in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.530" end="00:14:13.350" style="s2">ways to slice this pie is to say that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.780" end="00:14:15.310" style="s2">multiple lines of intelligence model</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.350" end="00:14:16.900" style="s2">crucifies say multiple lines of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.310" end="00:14:19.030" style="s2">intelligence and so if there&#39;s anything</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.900" end="00:14:21.940" style="s2">like a generalized intelligence it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.030" end="00:14:25.390" style="s2">to do with your basic capacity to build</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.940" end="00:14:26.950" style="s2">in any intelligence right and so some</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.390" end="00:14:28.750" style="s2">people are gifted at building in</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.950" end="00:14:30.550" style="s2">mathematical intelligences which is to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.750" end="00:14:32.460" style="s2">say they can move up and down this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.550" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">hierarchy of complexity think an</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.460" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2">abstraction they can do that in math</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:39.820" style="s2">really well that&#39;s measured on IQ tests</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.870" end="00:14:41.950" style="s2">right other people can move up and down</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.820" end="00:14:46.090" style="s2">this abstraction and complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.950" end="00:14:48.220" style="s2">let&#39;s say music or dance right and there</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.090" end="00:14:50.050" style="s2">are hierarchies of abstraction and dance</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.220" end="00:14:51.460" style="s2">if you&#39;ve seen a skilled dancer that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.050" end="00:14:53.680" style="s2">have is someone who&#39;s supervening on a</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.460" end="00:14:55.630" style="s2">lot of possible moves and building this</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.680" end="00:14:58.120" style="s2">trajectory towards an aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.630" end="00:15:00.610" style="s2">experience that&#39;s a very abstract thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.120" end="00:15:02.200" style="s2">to do very complex skill development</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.610" end="00:15:06.310" style="s2">you&#39;re not gonna get that an IQ test</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.200" end="00:15:08.530" style="s2">also not valued in the army you know in</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.310" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">the places where IQ tests find the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.530" end="00:15:12.280" style="s2">people who do the work right and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:14.710" style="s2">predictive validity I think is sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.280" end="00:15:16.780" style="s2">too so I think one of the myths we need</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.710" end="00:15:18.760" style="s2">to bust is that these people who do</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.780" end="00:15:20.290" style="s2">great on IQ tests actually do great in</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.760" end="00:15:22.330" style="s2">the world like this is we need to look</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.290" end="00:15:25.230" style="s2">into that just like the SAT and the GRE</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.330" end="00:15:27.820" style="s2">have very minimal predictive validity</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.230" end="00:15:29.530" style="s2">there are studies that show the GRE to</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.820" end="00:15:30.410" style="s2">be negatively predictive of graduate</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.530" end="00:15:32.660" style="s2">school success</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.410" end="00:15:34.010" style="s2">which is to say you do good on the GRE</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.660" end="00:15:37.010" style="s2">you actually do bad at writing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.010" end="00:15:38.780" style="s2">dissertation it&#39;s interesting right like</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.010" end="00:15:40.550" style="s2">I did terrible on these kinds of tests</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.780" end="00:15:41.900" style="s2">i&#39;m dyslexic this is little personal i</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.550" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">did pretty good at writing a</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.900" end="00:15:47.000" style="s2">dissertation and so i think there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:50.150" style="s2">complicated kind of cluster of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.000" end="00:15:51.400" style="s2">that make us look at particular types of</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.150" end="00:15:54.140" style="s2">skill development in particular</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.400" end="00:15:56.780" style="s2">capacities from particular lines that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.140" end="00:15:59.350" style="s2">what we value that&#39;s intelligence need</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.780" end="00:16:03.260" style="s2">to think more broadly and in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.350" end="00:16:05.300" style="s2">context or in globally you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.260" end="00:16:07.460" style="s2">it was Hunter s Thompson who said when</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.300" end="00:16:09.860" style="s2">the going gets weird the weird turn pro</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.460" end="00:16:11.690" style="s2">right and this is the situation we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.860" end="00:16:14.780" style="s2">and so we need to start looking at these</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.690" end="00:16:17.750" style="s2">much different forms of intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.780" end="00:16:20.270" style="s2">still thinking about growing right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.750" end="00:16:22.250" style="s2">so it becomes less about one form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.270" end="00:16:24.740" style="s2">intelligence and more about many and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.250" end="00:16:28.100" style="s2">functional fit and the unique profile of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.740" end="00:16:29.750" style="s2">the individual it&#39;s a worthwhile concept</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.100" end="00:16:31.910" style="s2">amongst the multiple lines of</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.750" end="00:16:35.560" style="s2">intelligence two separate ones that seem</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.910" end="00:16:38.750" style="s2">more generally abstract form or embodied</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.560" end="00:16:40.400" style="s2">so and this is just fitting a very rough</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.750" end="00:16:41.870" style="s2">intuition I think many people have say</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.400" end="00:16:44.030" style="s2">you take the mathematical line of</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.870" end="00:16:45.860" style="s2">development and you take linguistic and</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.030" end="00:16:47.570" style="s2">then maybe you take some orientation</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.860" end="00:16:49.580" style="s2">towards the physical sciences right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.570" end="00:16:51.620" style="s2">you cluster those things and you say</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.580" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">computers could get fairly good at that</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.620" end="00:16:56.120" style="s2">without symbol rounding problem issues</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:58.610" style="s2">right without sensorial grounding but</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.120" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">dance and maybe certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.610" end="00:17:04.780" style="s2">interpersonal and naturalistic and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:07.520" style="s2">even numinous or spiritual intelligences</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.780" end="00:17:08.930" style="s2">kind of cluster differently maybe we say</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.520" end="00:17:10.370" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t we shouldn&#39;t cluster them</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.930" end="00:17:10.839" style="s2">at all they&#39;re a totally different</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.370" end="00:17:13.699" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.839" end="00:17:15.410" style="s2">but is there a clustering like that that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.699" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">makes any sense and then it is there</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:18.410" style="s2">something that we can think of as</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:21.010" style="s2">general implicates within the more</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.410" end="00:17:23.390" style="s2">cognitive domains that is accessible</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.010" end="00:17:24.860" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s a great question and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.390" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">was one of the questions that drove the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.860" end="00:17:29.180" style="s2">new OPI dance because the new Canadians</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:30.770" style="s2">got to the point where they say okay we</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.180" end="00:17:34.550" style="s2">know there are still these levels but</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.770" end="00:17:35.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not like one big jump up yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.550" end="00:17:39.110" style="s2">many little jumps in many different</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.990" end="00:17:40.820" style="s2">areas like a growing tree many branches</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.110" end="00:17:41.929" style="s2">like the Darwinian metaphor but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.820" end="00:17:43.580" style="s2">skill development</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.929" end="00:17:45.440" style="s2">but they said you know that like this</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.580" end="00:17:47.090" style="s2">other intuitively there&#39;s clusters you</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.440" end="00:17:48.169" style="s2">know if you&#39;re good at physics and math</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.090" end="00:17:50.059" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re gonna be good at</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.169" end="00:17:51.830" style="s2">dance you know but if you&#39;re good in</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.059" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">physics at math you probably will be</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.830" end="00:17:56.929" style="s2">good at biology so there&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:58.999" style="s2">near and far transfer problem and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.929" end="00:18:01.129" style="s2">lent to the issue of possible basic</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.999" end="00:18:03.080" style="s2">structures underlying kind of deeper</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.129" end="00:18:05.090" style="s2">branches in this trees of development</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.080" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">and so Robbie case who&#39;s doing another</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.090" end="00:18:09.740" style="s2">great newbie yet in the University of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:10.970" style="s2">Toronto close Fisher colleague they did</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.740" end="00:18:12.710" style="s2">some of the first dynamic systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.970" end="00:18:13.999" style="s2">modeling of these things and they found</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.710" end="00:18:17.029" style="s2">some of these deep structures it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.999" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">interesting mathematical psychology but</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.029" end="00:18:19.940" style="s2">what they showed Robbie case in</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:21.230" style="s2">particular was that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.940" end="00:18:23.419" style="s2">like a deep structure to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.230" end="00:18:25.330" style="s2">mathematical domain and it was the</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.419" end="00:18:27.950" style="s2">number line and he had this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.330" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">simple study where he showed if you</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.950" end="00:18:32.299" style="s2">introduce inner-city kids to the number</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.409" style="s2">line before any other mathematics which</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.299" end="00:18:34.789" style="s2">by the way they don&#39;t get because they</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.409" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have like calendars hanging on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.789" end="00:18:37.700" style="s2">wall and their parents like I&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:39.320" style="s2">them about Lanier&#39;s things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.700" end="00:18:41.450" style="s2">not playing chutes and ladders like in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.320" end="00:18:43.999" style="s2">calm environment stuff but you show them</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.450" end="00:18:45.860" style="s2">this number line they&#39;re doing as well</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.999" end="00:18:47.659" style="s2">and first grade as any of these kids</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.860" end="00:18:49.279" style="s2">from the suburbs because they got the</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.850" end="00:19:02.059" style="s2">right so I probably case thought there</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:03.470" style="s2">was probably one for a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.470" end="00:19:07.639" style="s2">and there was probably long for</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.639" end="00:19:12.529" style="s2">one for interpersonal which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.679" end="00:19:14.149" style="s2">your relation to yourself so if I were</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.470" style="s2">think typically what we think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.769" end="00:19:26.899" style="s2">intelligence is really</p>

<p begin="00:19:36.440" end="00:19:42.049" style="s2">a whole cluster of domains of socio</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.299" end="00:19:44.749" style="s2">ethical which has to do abstraction for</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.049" end="00:19:46.850" style="s2">a minute so please rubik&#39;s cube is</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.749" end="00:19:49.249" style="s2">moving around spatio-temporal temporal</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.850" end="00:19:53.119" style="s2">physical things but then as you move up</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.249" end="00:19:55.850" style="s2">into actual axioms but axioms about say</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.119" end="00:19:57.800" style="s2">physics right so you&#39;re you&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.850" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">to a degree of abstraction that requires</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.110" end="00:20:05.180" style="s2">but that requires mapping to sense for a</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.400" end="00:20:12.860" style="s2">precisely that Maps all the way up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.680" end="00:20:15.380" style="s2">abstract that kind exactly so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.860" end="00:20:17.540" style="s2">three brand that tree comes up three</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.380" end="00:20:20.630" style="s2">branches go out each of those branches</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.540" end="00:20:23.750" style="s2">go all the way up to the axioms and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.630" end="00:20:26.840" style="s2">this the the spatio-temporal logical</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.750" end="00:20:28.670" style="s2">mathematical one starts with the kids</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.840" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">learning gravity and the ball bouncing</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.670" end="00:20:32.120" style="s2">and all of the things you do in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:33.380" style="s2">spatio-temporal were the PJ investigated</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.120" end="00:20:34.940" style="s2">he mostly investigated that line</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.380" end="00:20:37.340" style="s2">investigated the emergence of things</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.940" end="00:20:39.320" style="s2">like the idea of causality right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.340" end="00:20:40.670" style="s2">a time before kids understand causality</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.320" end="00:20:42.680" style="s2">rate then they come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.670" end="00:20:45.080" style="s2">cosmology cause and effect then you get</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.680" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">hypothetical deductive reasoning which</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.080" end="00:20:50.360" style="s2">is still a higher more abstract in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">domain but whole of the things happen in</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.360" end="00:20:55.310" style="s2">that other branch of the socio you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:20:57.770" style="s2">moral and ethical and similarly with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.310" end="00:20:59.960" style="s2">intra but they&#39;re all related as well</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.770" end="00:21:02.900" style="s2">and the brain says inter tangle at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.960" end="00:21:04.790" style="s2">higher levels so this is the view again</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.900" end="00:21:07.070" style="s2">the IQ test what we think of is over</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.790" end="00:21:11.920" style="s2">there sorry we look at the objective</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.070" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">branch right mathematics sciences etc</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.920" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">how well does IQ map to actual</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:21.980" style="s2">proclivity there so say you have someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.470" style="s2">that solve a Rubik&#39;s cubes very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.980" end="00:21:27.880" style="s2">will they actually be more likely to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.470" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">have novel developments in physics as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.880" end="00:21:32.750" style="s2">scientist or might they just be great at</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:34.850" style="s2">puzzles that are already defined but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.750" end="00:21:38.090" style="s2">creative intelligence within that domain</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.850" end="00:21:39.920" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard some stories of like Niels</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.090" end="00:21:41.480" style="s2">Bohr being a very slow thinker but</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.920" end="00:21:43.460" style="s2">having a slow process that led to</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.480" end="00:21:45.950" style="s2">profound originality so let&#39;s talk about</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.460" end="00:21:49.850" style="s2">even within the realm of reasoning about</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.950" end="00:21:53.090" style="s2">objective reality different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.850" end="00:21:54.920" style="s2">intelligence patterns yeah no and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.090" end="00:21:56.930" style="s2">this is one of the big questions in</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.920" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">intelligence research even those who</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.930" end="00:22:01.040" style="s2">transcended the IQ concept like Stern</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:02.750" style="s2">Bergen and and Gardner there was</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.040" end="00:22:04.550" style="s2">discretion of okay iq does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.750" end="00:22:06.620" style="s2">predict something in some areas but</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.550" end="00:22:09.620" style="s2">what&#39;s interesting Howard wrote a book</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.620" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">called creative minds and basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.620" end="00:22:13.790" style="s2">this book is about this question and it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.080" end="00:22:15.530" style="s2">turns out that many scientists like</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.790" end="00:22:18.140" style="s2">Einstein for example you know Einstein&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.530" end="00:22:20.690" style="s2">reading Spinoza and playing violin like</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.140" end="00:22:23.690" style="s2">in a little philosophical reading group</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.690" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">as a patent clerk before relativity you</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.690" end="00:22:28.670" style="s2">know I mean and then you look at other</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:30.470" style="s2">scientists who have far transfer away</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.670" end="00:22:32.630" style="s2">from the scientific domain typically to</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.470" end="00:22:34.610" style="s2">some other area which then gives</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.630" end="00:22:37.010" style="s2">inspiration back to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.610" end="00:22:38.420" style="s2">domain and this is you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.010" end="00:22:42.140" style="s2">things we&#39;re seeing collecting it too is</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.420" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">that you the broader your base right the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.140" end="00:22:47.390" style="s2">healthier any of those branch has become</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:50.120" style="s2">and more easy the transfer is so you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.390" end="00:22:51.140" style="s2">in a sense can predict in the simple way</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.120" end="00:22:53.330" style="s2">this guy&#39;s gonna be able to do those</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.140" end="00:22:55.850" style="s2">equations right he&#39;s got this simple</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.330" end="00:22:57.770" style="s2">kind of kind of horsepower in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.850" end="00:22:59.510" style="s2">cognitive kind of domain to do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.770" end="00:23:01.490" style="s2">equations but is it going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.510" end="00:23:03.830" style="s2">innovative guy who comes up with totally</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.490" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">new equations right or realize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.830" end="00:23:07.730" style="s2">those equations aren&#39;t the equations we</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">should be doing so that&#39;s different than</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.730" end="00:23:13.820" style="s2">intelligence right so creative problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:15.170" style="s2">finding it&#39;s different than even</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.820" end="00:23:17.420" style="s2">creative problem solving let alone</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.170" end="00:23:19.070" style="s2">problem solving it&#39;s not creative that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.420" end="00:23:20.870" style="s2">routine which requires a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.070" end="00:23:23.450" style="s2">intelligence right which is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.870" end="00:23:27.020" style="s2">class of problems that are very</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.450" end="00:23:28.250" style="s2">difficult but routine and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.020" end="00:23:30.020" style="s2">problems people don&#39;t even know yet and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.250" end="00:23:32.900" style="s2">so they again there&#39;s a space of</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.020" end="00:23:35.660" style="s2">unexplored of higher human potentials</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.900" end="00:23:37.880" style="s2">and forms of creativity but I think our</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.660" end="00:23:39.320" style="s2">schooling hasn&#39;t allowed us to see what</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.880" end="00:23:40.820" style="s2">happens when you take some of the super</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.320" end="00:23:44.330" style="s2">high mathematical IQ and teach them to</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.820" end="00:23:45.980" style="s2">meditate you just defined a number of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.330" end="00:23:47.480" style="s2">important concepts before we lose them</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.980" end="00:23:49.010" style="s2">oh there&#39;s some cross training that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.480" end="00:23:51.950" style="s2">mentioned which is important but</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.010" end="00:23:53.630" style="s2">specifically you defined problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.950" end="00:23:56.360" style="s2">and problem finding as fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.630" end="00:23:59.210" style="s2">different kinds of happens and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.360" end="00:24:01.670" style="s2">seems to me like problem solving within</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.210" end="00:24:03.970" style="s2">an already existing problem domain kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.670" end="00:24:07.580" style="s2">of maps to hill climbing right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.970" end="00:24:09.080" style="s2">problem finding maps to valley crossing</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.580" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">from a kind of evolutionary biology</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.080" end="00:24:13.730" style="s2">perspective which Eric Weinstein says</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:14.960" style="s2">the first one is what we call excellent</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.730" end="00:24:17.030" style="s2">the second is remarkable remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.960" end="00:24:18.830" style="s2">figures out new shit excellent does a</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.030" end="00:24:21.040" style="s2">good job at predefined stuff so Rubik&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.830" end="00:24:23.180" style="s2">Cube is obviously problem solving right</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.040" end="00:24:25.100" style="s2">figuring out new things that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.180" end="00:24:27.380" style="s2">were in the unknown unknown requires a</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.100" end="00:24:31.280" style="s2">different kind of exploration how do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.380" end="00:24:33.830" style="s2">assess each of those differentially and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.280" end="00:24:35.480" style="s2">again the assessment question is this</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.830" end="00:24:37.580" style="s2">tough I mean that&#39;s the million-dollar</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.480" end="00:24:39.410" style="s2">question in a way literally because of</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.580" end="00:24:41.720" style="s2">the political economy of the testing</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.410" end="00:24:45.950" style="s2">industry but if you can find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.720" end="00:24:48.740" style="s2">measure that creativity if you can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.950" end="00:24:50.540" style="s2">know and the valley crossing hill</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.740" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">climbing metaphor is apt I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.540" end="00:24:54.160" style="s2">the kind of thing we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:57.110" style="s2">here we&#39;re talking about those forms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.160" end="00:25:02.090" style="s2">creativity that break into new realms</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.110" end="00:25:03.650" style="s2">and you know I think I want to say about</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.090" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">assessing the honest answer is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.650" end="00:25:07.190" style="s2">know how to assess it I think what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:09.050" style="s2">know how to assess is well we know how</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.190" end="00:25:13.040" style="s2">to assess which is people you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.050" end="00:25:15.260" style="s2">working with how to know and as IQ</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.040" end="00:25:17.300" style="s2">mapped more to Hill cross to hill</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.260" end="00:25:20.360" style="s2">climbing than belly crossing definitely</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.300" end="00:25:22.280" style="s2">definitely now I think the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.360" end="00:25:23.840" style="s2">that&#39;s not true sometimes is because as</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:26.390" style="s2">I said if you take someone who&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.840" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">that and throw in an extra spice of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.390" end="00:25:30.560" style="s2">something that they may not even be in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:32.270" style="s2">their environment because precisely</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.560" end="00:25:34.100" style="s2">they&#39;re the high IQ guy who gets kept</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.270" end="00:25:36.110" style="s2">away from those things right there that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.100" end="00:25:39.020" style="s2">he&#39;s the kayak you got who goes to just</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.110" end="00:25:43.240" style="s2">do math and blahblah sends them to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.020" end="00:25:47.210" style="s2">zendo you don&#39;t even get him doing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.240" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">yeah exactly and so so yeah so I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.210" end="00:25:53.690" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the lessons here is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:56.990" style="s2">the IQ tests can make can make it seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.690" end="00:26:00.110" style="s2">like that&#39;s it when in fact that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.990" end="00:26:02.570" style="s2">kind of basic ingredients that let as it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.110" end="00:26:06.020" style="s2">were in one of the areas and you need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.570" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">bring more to it and that&#39;s just I think</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.020" end="00:26:10.670" style="s2">part of the part of the picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.830" style="s2">you know skill development the way a</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.670" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">Fisher thought about it had a very</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.830" end="00:26:17.780" style="s2">intuitive way of thinking about growth</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:20.690" style="s2">and not just static unchangeable</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.780" end="00:26:23.330" style="s2">capacity but growth and emergence of new</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.690" end="00:26:24.860" style="s2">capacity and that&#39;s the way the mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.330" end="00:26:27.260" style="s2">works I think that&#39;s the other fallacy</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.860" end="00:26:29.150" style="s2">of the IQ and the way intelligence is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.260" end="00:26:30.380" style="s2">often conceived is that it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.150" end="00:26:32.450" style="s2">you&#39;re smarter you&#39;re not smart</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.380" end="00:26:33.500" style="s2">all right well in fact everything we</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.450" end="00:26:35.870" style="s2">know about the mind is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.500" end="00:26:36.830" style="s2">changing literally all the time first of</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.870" end="00:26:38.060" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.830" end="00:26:39.500" style="s2">so you can be smart in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.060" end="00:26:40.130" style="s2">not smart than the late evening or vice</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.500" end="00:26:42.350" style="s2">versa</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.130" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">but it&#39;s also changing over the course</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.350" end="00:26:46.040" style="s2">of the lifespan drastically and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.970" end="00:26:47.960" style="s2">already sketched a hierarchy from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.040" end="00:26:49.370" style="s2">sensorimotor to the representational to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.960" end="00:26:52.250" style="s2">the abstract to the principal to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.370" end="00:26:53.750" style="s2">axiomatic and that&#39;s a spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.250" end="00:26:55.760" style="s2">hierarchical complexity that takes</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.750" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">literally decades to unfold and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.760" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">right socio-cultural conditions a few</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.950" style="s2">questions in Devon so when we think</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.490" end="00:27:05.990" style="s2">about hyper specialization within a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.950" end="00:27:07.820" style="s2">specific line and maybe even a specific</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.990" end="00:27:10.070" style="s2">subset of the line versus some cross</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.820" end="00:27:12.560" style="s2">training that leads to different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.070" end="00:27:15.350" style="s2">generalize capacities so let&#39;s take like</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.560" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">let&#39;s take a Bucky fuller polymath type</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.350" end="00:27:22.310" style="s2">or like a paul air dish almost savant</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:24.170" style="s2">extreme specialist type right so you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.310" end="00:27:25.640" style="s2">somebody like air dish and math who</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.170" end="00:27:27.830" style="s2">develops graph theory in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.640" end="00:27:29.120" style="s2">nobody else was even close but he</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.830" end="00:27:30.350" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tie a shoe to really do</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.120" end="00:27:32.450" style="s2">anything else functionally he had</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.350" end="00:27:33.710" style="s2">obviously allocated like something had</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.450" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">happened but all the horsepowers</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.710" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">allocating weight but in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:40.610" style="s2">created real novel value right then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:42.260" style="s2">see other people where they have novel</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.610" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">value development across many fields</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.260" end="00:27:46.190" style="s2">that are obviously inner informing each</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.760" end="00:27:48.010" style="s2">other because of lateral thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.190" end="00:27:50.120" style="s2">because of abstraction that is then</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.010" end="00:27:51.920" style="s2">finding generalized principles across</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.120" end="00:27:53.570" style="s2">domains what&#39;s the difference and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.920" end="00:27:55.880" style="s2">happening with those people and how much</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.570" end="00:27:59.060" style="s2">of that is intrinsic versus developed</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.880" end="00:28:01.190" style="s2">versus reinforced I think so hard to</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.060" end="00:28:03.140" style="s2">tell and I mean the one lesson about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.190" end="00:28:06.620" style="s2">mind is I think you need a uniqueness</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.140" end="00:28:09.230" style="s2">you Nissa T which is to say that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.620" end="00:28:11.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t know you know it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.230" end="00:28:13.700" style="s2">mind is a complex dynamical system and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.300" end="00:28:15.680" style="s2">so the butterfly can flap at one point</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.700" end="00:28:18.560" style="s2">in childhood then you get a storm in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.680" end="00:28:20.540" style="s2">Chicago late in adulthood and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.560" end="00:28:23.900" style="s2">know you can&#39;t connect those dots and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.540" end="00:28:25.640" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting you know I think Kurt</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.900" end="00:28:27.770" style="s2">Fisher again I keep bringing him up he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.640" end="00:28:30.800" style="s2">my beloved you know advisor he always</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.770" end="00:28:32.810" style="s2">tells a story these two theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.800" end="00:28:35.900" style="s2">physicists they knew both hit by cars</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.810" end="00:28:38.630" style="s2">crossing a street right which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.900" end="00:28:41.330" style="s2">again you know Einstein the torso he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.630" end="00:28:43.970" style="s2">you know he wouldn&#39;t cash his paycheck</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.330" end="00:28:46.550" style="s2">he&#39;d use it as like a slip in his book</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.970" end="00:28:48.260" style="s2">it&#39;s a bookmark and then his secretary</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.550" end="00:28:49.720" style="s2">if I didn&#39;t can put in this yeah he</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.260" end="00:28:52.509" style="s2">would didn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.720" end="00:28:53.460" style="s2">there&#39;s a soul hypothesis you know when</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.509" end="00:28:55.570" style="s2">you move up this hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.460" end="00:28:58.899" style="s2">representations abstractions principles</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.570" end="00:29:00.220" style="s2">actions you know why would we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.899" end="00:29:01.690" style="s2">that and that&#39;s the bana like what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.220" end="00:29:03.909" style="s2">million years ago like why is that a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.690" end="00:29:06.759" style="s2">capacity of the brain it&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.909" end="00:29:09.490" style="s2">thing and so one thought is that as you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.759" end="00:29:12.549" style="s2">move up that you&#39;re kind of recycling</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.490" end="00:29:14.860" style="s2">some of your neuronal material which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.549" end="00:29:19.179" style="s2">to say that every move in growth is also</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.860" end="00:29:22.629" style="s2">a loss like were and every time you grow</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.179" end="00:29:24.909" style="s2">up right you also lose little so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.629" end="00:29:27.669" style="s2">one of the reasons child childhood is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.909" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">kind of bittersweet in and you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.669" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">these memories that are so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">because you know there was something as</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:35.799" style="s2">a child that you no longer have that in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:38.710" style="s2">some ways was as valuable but it had to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.799" end="00:29:39.909" style="s2">be lost as you grew and that way of</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.710" end="00:29:41.200" style="s2">thing about the mind is way more</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.909" end="00:29:42.309" style="s2">attractive to me and then thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.200" end="00:29:45.600" style="s2">well you were smart kid and I are</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.309" end="00:29:48.129" style="s2">smarter don&#39;t lie yeah just that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.600" end="00:29:51.159" style="s2">but you&#39;re also this very complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.129" end="00:29:53.139" style="s2">growing organism the minds like an</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.159" end="00:29:55.000" style="s2">organism that literally metabolizes its</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.139" end="00:29:56.620" style="s2">environment and depending on what it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.000" end="00:29:59.350" style="s2">metabolizes it grows in certain ways or</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.620" end="00:30:00.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t so what you&#39;re saying I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.350" end="00:30:02.259" style="s2">obviously makes sense that no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.909" end="00:30:03.879" style="s2">much muscular development we have the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.259" end="00:30:06.370" style="s2">moment we stop developing those muscles</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.879" end="00:30:07.929" style="s2">they start to shrink if they require</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.370" end="00:30:09.220" style="s2">continuous input that that could be the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.929" end="00:30:11.620" style="s2">same with cognitive or psycho-emotional</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.220" end="00:30:13.480" style="s2">or other tasks but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.620" end="00:30:15.429" style="s2">zero-sum element what you&#39;re saying in</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.480" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">terms of total memory bandwidth and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.429" end="00:30:19.809" style="s2">complexity of processing where if we</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:21.129" style="s2">develop in some areas it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.809" end="00:30:23.080" style="s2">there has to be neuro plastic</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.129" end="00:30:24.639" style="s2">restructuring for optimization for those</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.080" end="00:30:26.379" style="s2">kinds of things at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.639" end="00:30:27.730" style="s2">optimization for other things which of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.379" end="00:30:28.899" style="s2">course makes perfect sense and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.730" end="00:30:30.279" style="s2">is the way we usually think of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.899" end="00:30:32.110" style="s2">there&#39;s a thought that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.279" end="00:30:34.149" style="s2">interesting to me which is a nonzero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.110" end="00:30:36.460" style="s2">right deposited somewhere one can</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.149" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">develop new capacities well enforcing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.460" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">existing capacities and just have more</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">net capacity more computational capacity</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.690" style="s2">across the spectrum speak to me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">absolutely and this was often called</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.690" end="00:30:51.429" style="s2">explicitly thematized far transfer right</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:54.100" style="s2">and so what this is just a fancy way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.429" end="00:30:55.570" style="s2">saying like no you let&#39;s say you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.100" end="00:30:57.190" style="s2">really smart guy mathematics and you</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.570" end="00:30:59.320" style="s2">start to learn the piano you start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.190" end="00:31:01.179" style="s2">learn the piano and you&#39;ve never played</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.179" end="00:31:03.170" style="s2">here it&#39;d have to be like a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:07.010" style="s2">for many weeks</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.170" end="00:31:08.840" style="s2">many months maybe years now that could</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.010" end="00:31:10.700" style="s2">be very frustrating and you can separate</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.840" end="00:31:12.050" style="s2">it from everything else you know I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.700" end="00:31:14.540" style="s2">try to build it as an independent skill</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.050" end="00:31:16.280" style="s2">or you can find a way to interweave this</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.540" end="00:31:18.530" style="s2">new skill development with your existing</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.280" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">high level skill and Fischer would often</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.530" end="00:31:24.260" style="s2">talk about bringing a structure you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:26.390" style="s2">transferring it over and down and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.260" end="00:31:28.100" style="s2">you kind of get this helix model where</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.390" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing in everything that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.100" end="00:31:31.250" style="s2">you&#39;re growing instead of growing things</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.270" style="s2">out in the separate places and you see</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.250" end="00:31:34.310" style="s2">this all the time so it&#39;s like you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.270" end="00:31:36.560" style="s2">have a meditation practice as you leave</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.310" end="00:31:38.690" style="s2">somewhere when you go to work right or</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.560" end="00:31:41.540" style="s2">you&#39;re you go to the gym and then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.690" end="00:31:42.950" style="s2">come out and eat shit and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.540" end="00:31:44.660" style="s2">there&#39;s this issue of the segmentation</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.950" end="00:31:46.910" style="s2">and again there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.660" end="00:31:48.980" style="s2">socio-cultural reasons for that so the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.910" end="00:31:50.660" style="s2">explicitly thematized fire transfer or</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.980" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">even near transferring is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.660" end="00:31:54.470" style="s2">saying it&#39;s about bringing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:57.130" style="s2">coherence to the skill development so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.470" end="00:31:59.870" style="s2">you don&#39;t have this fractured weird</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.130" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">profile of skills but rather skills that</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.870" end="00:32:03.920" style="s2">are coherently related to one another</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:05.690" style="s2">you know it&#39;s gonna be hard to pull off</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.920" end="00:32:08.440" style="s2">you know because we often have the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.690" end="00:32:11.420" style="s2">hypertrophy skills in certain areas rain</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.440" end="00:32:12.740" style="s2">seems to me to be what is the mattock of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.420" end="00:32:17.060" style="s2">all of the polymaths</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.740" end="00:32:19.220" style="s2">that we study is that they didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.060" end="00:32:20.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually categorize your segments</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.220" end="00:32:21.560" style="s2">the different areas in which they had</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.390" end="00:32:23.780" style="s2">expertise is fundamentally different</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.560" end="00:32:25.130" style="s2">they thought about Universal reality as</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.780" end="00:32:27.860" style="s2">a much more integrated thing and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.130" end="00:32:28.970" style="s2">they were studying in ecology became a</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.860" end="00:32:31.820" style="s2">model for how they thought about</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.970" end="00:32:33.410" style="s2">economics or psychology or biology right</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.820" end="00:32:35.630" style="s2">so they would then go to an abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.410" end="00:32:37.430" style="s2">level called complex systems right or</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.630" end="00:32:39.230" style="s2">complex causation whatever and then they</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.430" end="00:32:40.850" style="s2">would think about the lateral</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.230" end="00:32:43.190" style="s2">application of principles one domain to</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.850" end="00:32:46.280" style="s2">other domains so there there was of</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.190" end="00:32:47.720" style="s2">course no just net memory because</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.280" end="00:32:52.340" style="s2">everything actually made sense and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.720" end="00:32:53.690" style="s2">crossing in a referenced yeah it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.340" end="00:32:56.360" style="s2">learning modality I think it&#39;s schooling</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.690" end="00:32:57.890" style="s2">is a big deal here we wouldn&#39;t have IQ</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.360" end="00:32:59.720" style="s2">tests if we didn&#39;t have the factory</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.890" end="00:33:01.250" style="s2">schools and we wouldn&#39;t think about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.720" end="00:33:04.070" style="s2">nature of the disciplines the way we do</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.250" end="00:33:06.200" style="s2">if we didn&#39;t have you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.070" end="00:33:08.990" style="s2">post-war military industrial university</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.200" end="00:33:10.700" style="s2">comics I mean it&#39;s very regimented if</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.990" end="00:33:13.490" style="s2">you think about the training for example</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.700" end="00:33:15.030" style="s2">of the highly specialized engineers and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.490" end="00:33:20.190" style="s2">doctors and these people</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.030" end="00:33:21.570" style="s2">and so I&#39;m very much a fan of you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.190" end="00:33:23.580" style="s2">blurring some of these distinctions</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.570" end="00:33:27.059" style="s2">doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t even lessening expertise</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.580" end="00:33:29.220" style="s2">but it means you know bringing more to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.059" end="00:33:31.440" style="s2">that and humanizing it always been the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.220" end="00:33:33.299" style="s2">call of the philosopher of Education is</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.440" end="00:33:35.340" style="s2">to bring the humanities into the science</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.299" end="00:33:37.770" style="s2">departments if only so they do better</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.340" end="00:33:39.510" style="s2">science you know not so they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.770" end="00:33:41.370" style="s2">science but so they do they can make the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.510" end="00:33:45.539" style="s2">creative like the Gaia hypothesis brings</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.370" end="00:33:49.530" style="s2">in you know ancient Greek myth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.539" end="00:33:51.720" style="s2">that&#39;s profound when you see like The</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.530" end="00:33:53.730" style="s2">DaVinci machine doing surgery better</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.720" end="00:33:56.429" style="s2">than any surgeon right and that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.730" end="00:33:58.950" style="s2">entering a domain in which almost every</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.429" end="00:34:02.429" style="s2">human skill that would require expertise</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.950" end="00:34:04.440" style="s2">is becoming automatable better than we</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.429" end="00:34:07.500" style="s2">do it but the process to build</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.440" end="00:34:09.450" style="s2">automation technologies requires not</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.500" end="00:34:11.730" style="s2">just hill climbing but valley crossing</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.450" end="00:34:13.590" style="s2">kinds of intelligence to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.730" end="00:34:16.230" style="s2">those domains are and how to do them how</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.590" end="00:34:19.200" style="s2">do you see the need for hyper</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.230" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">specialization changing with advanced</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.200" end="00:34:22.700" style="s2">technology exponential tech and</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:26.040" style="s2">automation</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.700" end="00:34:27.600" style="s2">yeah I mean I think the people at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.040" end="00:34:28.860" style="s2">edges of those fields don&#39;t even really</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.600" end="00:34:31.230" style="s2">think about what the disciplinary</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.860" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">boundaries are or ought to be I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.230" end="00:34:36.780" style="s2">we&#39;re in uncharted territory in most of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:38.340" style="s2">these fields you know and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.780" end="00:34:40.380" style="s2">important to realize you know it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.340" end="00:34:41.820" style="s2">of the broader global transformation as</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.380" end="00:34:45.120" style="s2">a global transformation the way</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.820" end="00:34:46.679" style="s2">knowledge is produced and it means</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.120" end="00:34:48.210" style="s2">supervening on the traditional research</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.679" end="00:34:52.350" style="s2">academy and blurring those boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.210" end="00:34:54.570" style="s2">they have to be systems biology I mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.350" end="00:34:56.820" style="s2">they just you name any field and it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.570" end="00:34:58.920" style="s2">feelings any relevant fields to fields</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.820" end="00:35:01.200" style="s2">you know mind brain and education this</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.920" end="00:35:02.850" style="s2">was Kurt Fisher founded the mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.200" end="00:35:04.380" style="s2">and education Society and I worked on</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.850" end="00:35:07.740" style="s2">that journal this is a radically</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.380" end="00:35:10.680" style="s2">transdisciplinary field so I think yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.740" end="00:35:14.250" style="s2">we&#39;re it&#39;s it&#39;s an interesting period to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.680" end="00:35:16.860" style="s2">be someone who has an expertise so I</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.250" end="00:35:18.300" style="s2">have training develop but I&#39;m working in</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.860" end="00:35:20.940" style="s2">all kinds of fields because the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.300" end="00:35:22.440" style="s2">traditional and a model of what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.940" end="00:35:24.330" style="s2">developmental psychologist does has</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.440" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">changed so radically and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:28.260" style="s2">the story for a lot of people so I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:30.060" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking and people feel it</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.260" end="00:35:32.790" style="s2">whether they&#39;re supplementing their</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.060" end="00:35:35.040" style="s2">graduate education with other gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.790" end="00:35:38.460" style="s2">quote non-traditional forms of exposure</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.040" end="00:35:43.050" style="s2">you know which are kind of leavening</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.460" end="00:35:44.460" style="s2">that and bringing yeah I guess I think I</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.050" end="00:35:47.940" style="s2">think going gets weird the weird turn</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.460" end="00:35:52.170" style="s2">pearl and that&#39;s exactly which it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.940" end="00:35:55.050" style="s2">the weird turning pro as opposed to what</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.170" end="00:35:56.850" style="s2">was all previously right so now our best</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.050" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">chess players can be beaten by AI our</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.850" end="00:36:00.630" style="s2">best go players can be and we that</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:02.550" style="s2">exponential curve hasn&#39;t even barely</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.630" end="00:36:05.700" style="s2">started to take off right so when it</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.550" end="00:36:07.770" style="s2">comes to health planning we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.700" end="00:36:09.510" style="s2">build tools that would help climb us in</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.770" end="00:36:11.550" style="s2">there on every hill right in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.510" end="00:36:14.010" style="s2">excellence what it used to mean of</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.550" end="00:36:19.650" style="s2">machines that can outfit a violin or</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.010" end="00:36:22.650" style="s2">whatever those in does weight and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.650" end="00:36:25.080" style="s2">is less clear as far as AGI goes if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.650" end="00:36:28.260" style="s2">would get valley crossing in the same</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.080" end="00:36:30.360" style="s2">way at least right now right so then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.260" end="00:36:33.090" style="s2">hypothesis that education should be more</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.360" end="00:36:34.860" style="s2">oriented towards problem finding than</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.090" end="00:36:35.420" style="s2">problem solving and then figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.860" end="00:36:38.660" style="s2">how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.420" end="00:36:41.660" style="s2">nice technology for problem-solving you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.660" end="00:36:43.460" style="s2">say that&#39;s a big part of Education yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.660" end="00:36:45.470" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s a discipline of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.460" end="00:36:47.710" style="s2">process it&#39;s one of the premises of my</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.470" end="00:36:50.089" style="s2">book that&#39;s coming out soon is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.710" end="00:36:52.040" style="s2">artificial intelligence and things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.089" end="00:36:54.829" style="s2">basic income guarantees and radical</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.040" end="00:36:56.599" style="s2">changes in the kind of macroeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.829" end="00:36:58.220" style="s2">structure or globally they&#39;re gonna make</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.599" end="00:37:00.920" style="s2">education as we&#39;ve known a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.220" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">irrelevant and we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.920" end="00:37:06.049" style="s2">radically think you know rethink a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.400" end="00:37:08.420" style="s2">of things and so the thought of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.049" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">problem finding is actually a thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.420" end="00:37:12.740" style="s2">about values that&#39;s what&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:16.190" style="s2">interesting about that and so again the</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.740" end="00:37:18.950" style="s2">basic issue in the faucet of Education</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.190" end="00:37:21.619" style="s2">is what is a good life what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.950" end="00:37:24.470" style="s2">to be a good person or to have a good</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.619" end="00:37:30.980" style="s2">society and so problem finding is it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.470" end="00:37:32.660" style="s2">along that trajectory of value and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.980" end="00:37:35.500" style="s2">and that&#39;s again we&#39;re back to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.660" end="00:37:38.839" style="s2">humanities and we&#39;re back to you yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.500" end="00:37:41.750" style="s2">resist the temptation to get into ethics</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.839" end="00:37:45.200" style="s2">and existentialism and can you get into</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.750" end="00:37:47.390" style="s2">forecasts about exponential tech and</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.200" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">what that means for education and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.390" end="00:37:50.960" style="s2">the future of education should be flag</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:52.930" style="s2">those are all podcasts I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.960" end="00:37:56.390" style="s2">do together</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.930" end="00:37:58.670" style="s2">coming back to people who are listening</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.390" end="00:38:01.309" style="s2">to this that you know there might be</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.670" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">some people who have children are</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.309" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">planning on having children are really</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:06.290" style="s2">interested in their development</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:08.839" style="s2">obviously we kind of need to address</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.290" end="00:38:10.369" style="s2">that as its own thing but for people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.839" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">like a lot of people are coming to neuro</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.369" end="00:38:12.500" style="s2">hacker right now because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.980" style="s2">interested in optimizing their own</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.500" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">capacity and their capacity roughly</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.980" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">matches to their cognitive intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:22.280" style="s2">capacity it also has to do with will and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:24.530" style="s2">drive and creativity and a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.280" end="00:38:26.930" style="s2">things but so for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.530" end="00:38:30.170" style="s2">thinking about their own capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.930" end="00:38:32.359" style="s2">how they can think about it how they can</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.170" end="00:38:35.030" style="s2">support it how they can enhance it you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.359" end="00:38:37.730" style="s2">obviously said that the way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.030" end="00:38:40.609" style="s2">about intelligence that is roughly valid</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.730" end="00:38:42.380" style="s2">in IQ is thinking about the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.609" end="00:38:45.170" style="s2">develop skills more than a particular</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.380" end="00:38:47.569" style="s2">skill except of course the pool shitty</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.170" end="00:38:48.440" style="s2">narrative was that&#39;s genetically fixed</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.569" end="00:38:50.200" style="s2">and then just kind of goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.440" end="00:38:55.069" style="s2">with age as your brain declines as</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.200" end="00:38:57.260" style="s2">opposed to every time you get a skill</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.069" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">that becomes now the knowledge there</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.260" end="00:39:00.050" style="s2">actually becomes a model for learning</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:03.380" style="s2">more stuff so you can actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.050" end="00:39:04.730" style="s2">exponential rate of growth where all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.380" end="00:39:06.200" style="s2">skills and all the knowledge you develop</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.730" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">become a basis for increased capacity</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.200" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">for developing new things if you do</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:14.950" style="s2">lateral thinking and abstraction and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:17.240" style="s2">generalization well right so a question</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.950" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">that I have because you mentioned a</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.240" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">number of things you said if you expose</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:22.849" style="s2">the kids from poor backgrounds to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.069" style="s2">number line that they just might not</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.849" end="00:39:28.310" style="s2">have been exposed to they start to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.069" end="00:39:30.490" style="s2">better if we&#39;re thinking about adults</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.310" end="00:39:33.140" style="s2">who already have they already did their</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.490" end="00:39:37.190" style="s2">SATs their IQ test they have some sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.140" end="00:39:38.690" style="s2">of kind of fixed capacity there and but</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.190" end="00:39:43.190" style="s2">they like to see if it&#39;s not fixed if it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.690" end="00:39:46.460" style="s2">is developable one how much what do we</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.190" end="00:39:50.630" style="s2">think about innate versus developable in</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.460" end="00:39:53.630" style="s2">terms of raw capacity and where there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.630" end="00:39:56.599" style="s2">relevance or not to that story and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.630" end="00:39:59.780" style="s2">what do we think about best processes</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.599" end="00:40:02.540" style="s2">for developing what we would roughly</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.780" end="00:40:03.619" style="s2">call the kind of any of the lens of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.540" end="00:40:05.210" style="s2">intelligence and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.619" end="00:40:09.500" style="s2">particularly the ones that relate to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.210" end="00:40:11.060" style="s2">it or objective categories totally yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.500" end="00:40:12.260" style="s2">the first question that&#39;s again is one</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.060" end="00:40:14.780" style="s2">of this question that comes up with the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.260" end="00:40:17.690" style="s2">IQ testing right which is basically no</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.780" end="00:40:19.880" style="s2">is it you know is it a mater can you</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.690" end="00:40:20.329" style="s2">change this thing and I think the answer</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.880" end="00:40:23.410" style="s2">is yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.329" end="00:40:27.260" style="s2">all right there&#39;s clearly some genetic</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.410" end="00:40:30.319" style="s2">it&#39;s undeniable that if you take a broad</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.260" end="00:40:32.089" style="s2">swath of the population and given my IQ</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.319" end="00:40:35.839" style="s2">test it&#39;s gonna accurately kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.089" end="00:40:37.520" style="s2">represent something and now many of</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.839" end="00:40:40.579" style="s2">those people will not change a lot in</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.520" end="00:40:43.550" style="s2">terms of if they&#39;re any good metatheory</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.579" end="00:40:45.079" style="s2">about what that is I saw one study on</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.550" end="00:40:47.540" style="s2">genetics that looked at people with</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.079" end="00:40:50.359" style="s2">above 170 IQ whole genome assessments</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.540" end="00:40:52.940" style="s2">and I think what it said was no</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.359" end="00:40:54.260" style="s2">individual snips made they had high</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.940" end="00:40:56.180" style="s2">correlation but there were patterns</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.260" end="00:40:59.810" style="s2">combinatorial patterns across the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.180" end="00:41:01.579" style="s2">genome probably to do something like you</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.810" end="00:41:02.240" style="s2">know increased grey matter density or</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.579" end="00:41:04.940" style="s2">something you</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.240" end="00:41:07.310" style="s2">are there any kind of I don&#39;t know and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.940" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">think I you know philosophically like</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.310" end="00:41:13.250" style="s2">the concept of heritability itself is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:16.520" style="s2">complicated right so technically my</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.250" end="00:41:18.260" style="s2">hands are I didn&#39;t inherit my hands his</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.520" end="00:41:20.960" style="s2">heritability has to do with correlations</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.260" end="00:41:24.530" style="s2">and and it&#39;s on the percent correlation</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.960" end="00:41:26.030" style="s2">so so yeah so I&#39;m not sure that we know</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.530" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">enough about genetics you have to really</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.030" end="00:41:29.660" style="s2">speculate and so it&#39;s hard to know if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:34.099" style="s2">inherited my dad&#39;s breaking or if I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.660" end="00:41:36.980" style="s2">inherited my dad&#39;s environment and but</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.099" end="00:41:38.930" style="s2">it&#39;s clear that you know there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.980" end="00:41:41.240" style="s2">differences and there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.930" end="00:41:43.369" style="s2">are harder to change and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.240" end="00:41:44.359" style="s2">more malleable I think one other reason</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.369" end="00:41:47.930" style="s2">we don&#39;t know the answer of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.359" end="00:41:50.030" style="s2">question is because basic levels like</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.930" end="00:41:52.820" style="s2">like Maslow level one kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.030" end="00:41:54.230" style="s2">physical kind of nutrition and safe</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.820" end="00:41:57.050" style="s2">environments and these things are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.230" end="00:41:58.820" style="s2">really available for many people on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.050" end="00:42:00.619" style="s2">planet and so when you get these</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.820" end="00:42:02.900" style="s2">sweeping studies about IQ differences</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.619" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">across let&#39;s say race or nationality or</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.900" end="00:42:07.849" style="s2">these things it&#39;s like can&#39;t really make</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:10.490" style="s2">inferences about anything it made or</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.849" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">genetic here because we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.490" end="00:42:16.190" style="s2">you know he&#39;s malnourished and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.690" style="s2">and so the nourishment of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.190" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t just nutrition it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.690" end="00:42:22.849" style="s2">information and semiotic right</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:25.700" style="s2">environment and a lack of drama and fear</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.849" end="00:42:27.260" style="s2">and right don&#39;tlet and so that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.700" end="00:42:29.630" style="s2">reason I&#39;m always so hesitant to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.260" end="00:42:32.000" style="s2">what to Nate because it&#39;s until we start</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.630" end="00:42:34.099" style="s2">to get really optimal basic conditions</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.000" end="00:42:37.130" style="s2">for people it&#39;s really hard it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.099" end="00:42:39.440" style="s2">hard to say what was in their genes and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.130" end="00:42:42.770" style="s2">what was became epigenetic from you from</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.440" end="00:42:45.470" style="s2">the womb so I think we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.770" end="00:42:47.390" style="s2">kind of nature of I am nurture as</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.470" end="00:42:49.790" style="s2">opposed to nature versus nurture and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.390" end="00:42:50.990" style="s2">when it comes to changing intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.790" end="00:42:53.330" style="s2">of their own intelligence there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.990" end="00:42:57.950" style="s2">there&#39;s so much you know exercising</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.330" end="00:43:00.230" style="s2">nutrition number one focus you know a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.950" end="00:43:02.359" style="s2">lot of what an IQ test gets that is just</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.230" end="00:43:04.869" style="s2">your ability to sit still and focus like</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.359" end="00:43:08.089" style="s2">when they are with the first kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.869" end="00:43:09.830" style="s2">1917 army alphas I mean what they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.089" end="00:43:12.050" style="s2">really getting the I was can this farm</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.830" end="00:43:14.480" style="s2">boys sit at a desk and take this test</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.050" end="00:43:15.340" style="s2">for 20 minutes that was really the main</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.480" end="00:43:17.440" style="s2">tip I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.340" end="00:43:19.840" style="s2">what they really captured so the things</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.440" end="00:43:22.450" style="s2">that allow you to focus and give</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.840" end="00:43:24.550" style="s2">attention are very important so</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.450" end="00:43:25.930" style="s2">meditation is classic but even just the</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.550" end="00:43:27.760" style="s2">concerted effort to control your own</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.930" end="00:43:29.710" style="s2">informational environment focus on one</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:32.830" style="s2">thing at a time which our culture it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.710" end="00:43:35.320" style="s2">hard to do so and I put that under</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.830" end="00:43:37.690" style="s2">nutrition because that&#39;s like as I said</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.320" end="00:43:39.820" style="s2">your your your mind is metabolic with</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.690" end="00:43:43.260" style="s2">the environment and so I&#39;m very careful</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.820" end="00:43:48.130" style="s2">with what I eat even if it&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.260" end="00:43:49.570" style="s2">so what are the psychic toxins that you</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.130" end="00:43:52.300" style="s2">want not to be eating as far as</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.570" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">intelligences that&#39;s interesting I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.300" end="00:43:57.670" style="s2">of them as kind of invasive species and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:43:59.530" style="s2">the ecology of the mind you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.670" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">advertisement is a great one one of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.530" end="00:44:03.280" style="s2">reasons that we are driven to</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:06.340" style="s2">distractions because of the culture the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.280" end="00:44:09.160" style="s2">advertisement that we have you know and</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.340" end="00:44:12.220" style="s2">then in general things that shorten the</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.160" end="00:44:13.210" style="s2">attention span by design right not</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.220" end="00:44:14.470" style="s2">things that&#39;s sure in the attention span</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.210" end="00:44:16.930" style="s2">because they&#39;re naturally short like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.470" end="00:44:18.250" style="s2">bird flies by okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.930" end="00:44:21.160" style="s2">but there are things that shorten our</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.250" end="00:44:22.690" style="s2">attention span by design and so we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.160" end="00:44:24.430" style="s2">to avoid those things because they teach</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.690" end="00:44:26.080" style="s2">us that that&#39;s how information work so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.430" end="00:44:27.520" style="s2">that&#39;s how learning is and if someone</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.080" end="00:44:29.440" style="s2">goes to a web site where they take an</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.520" end="00:44:32.410" style="s2">article and break it up into 20 next</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.440" end="00:44:36.820" style="s2">buttons to maximize that good suggests</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.410" end="00:44:38.260" style="s2">avoiding those websites or the yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.820" end="00:44:39.970" style="s2">not so much what is it maybe it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.260" end="00:44:42.580" style="s2">article maybe it&#39;s or not but literally</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.970" end="00:44:48.460" style="s2">the action of doing that is different</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.580" end="00:44:51.310" style="s2">from sitting with a book and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.460" end="00:44:54.820" style="s2">saying you know not it&#39;ll engage fully</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.310" end="00:44:57.190" style="s2">with the culture but be mindful that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.820" end="00:44:59.350" style="s2">can have junk food for your mind yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.190" end="00:45:01.000" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna junk food for your body and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.350" end="00:45:03.520" style="s2">the cult and that&#39;s the stuff that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.000" end="00:45:05.380" style="s2">culture wants us to eat right and so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.520" end="00:45:07.690" style="s2">have to find the secret hidden good</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.380" end="00:45:12.090" style="s2">stuff in the back where it&#39;s a long</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.690" end="00:45:14.440" style="s2">article with no it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.090" end="00:45:16.510" style="s2">independent of what you&#39;re studying just</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.440" end="00:45:18.790" style="s2">focusing for a period of time focused in</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.510" end="00:45:21.430" style="s2">the muscle of focus whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.790" end="00:45:22.990" style="s2">changing neural structures and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.430" end="00:45:25.990" style="s2">connectomics of it or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.990" end="00:45:29.140" style="s2">right there is some kind of development</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.990" end="00:45:31.150" style="s2">of the capacity for focus probably</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.140" end="00:45:32.830" style="s2">intensity of focus and duration of focus</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.150" end="00:45:33.850" style="s2">right so that&#39;s important but then you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.830" end="00:45:36.850" style="s2">could be focused on very different</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.850" end="00:45:39.070" style="s2">topics and you might say that some</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.850" end="00:45:43.060" style="s2">topics obviously whether the information</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.070" end="00:45:45.460" style="s2">is accurate or not and if it&#39;s factual</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.060" end="00:45:47.290" style="s2">information 10th matters but are there</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.460" end="00:45:50.080" style="s2">certain topics that you think have more</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.290" end="00:45:52.060" style="s2">relevance or ways of studying them or</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.080" end="00:45:53.050" style="s2">ways of thinking about them well this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.060" end="00:45:54.580" style="s2">where it gets interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.050" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">very next thing I was about to say is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.580" end="00:45:59.290" style="s2">that you also need to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:01.660" style="s2">learning there is to say one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.290" end="00:46:03.700" style="s2">important things you can focus on is the</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.660" end="00:46:05.800" style="s2">nature of development itself and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.700" end="00:46:06.660" style="s2">nature of your own learning so learn</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.800" end="00:46:09.580" style="s2">about the nature of learning</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.660" end="00:46:12.760" style="s2">scientifically but also learn about your</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.580" end="00:46:14.890" style="s2">own unique learning needs and patterns</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.760" end="00:46:16.540" style="s2">right so not everyone can sit with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.890" end="00:46:18.940" style="s2">book for 45 minutes but they can do 15</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.540" end="00:46:20.620" style="s2">minutes get up staring space walk around</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.940" end="00:46:23.260" style="s2">15 minutes get up staring space walk</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.620" end="00:46:27.160" style="s2">around right so you learn how you work</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.260" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">and a lot of research can help with that</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.160" end="00:46:30.790" style="s2">things like the neuro hacker resources</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:32.590" style="s2">all of these things should be grist for</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.790" end="00:46:34.330" style="s2">that mill but one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.590" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">see with people who go postconventional</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.330" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">and can it become self actualized and</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:40.150" style="s2">move up to these higher levels that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.870" style="s2">they&#39;re very reflective about their own</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.150" end="00:46:45.970" style="s2">learning they know how they learn when</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.870" end="00:46:48.010" style="s2">they learn best I know what excites them</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.970" end="00:46:50.770" style="s2">to know how to follow investigative</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.010" end="00:46:52.690" style="s2">patterns independently and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.770" end="00:46:54.190" style="s2">reflective and so they create these</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.690" end="00:46:56.740" style="s2">virtuous cycles of learning for</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.190" end="00:46:58.600" style="s2">themselves naturally throughout life as</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.740" end="00:47:01.600" style="s2">opposed to being kind of extrinsically</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.600" end="00:47:04.630" style="s2">motivated and driven which is what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.600" end="00:47:08.770" style="s2">schools yeah so this is a quantified</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.630" end="00:47:11.640" style="s2">self process around it one way to do it</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.770" end="00:47:15.160" style="s2">to quantify it totally and that can help</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.640" end="00:47:17.410" style="s2">you know you can also mistake the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.160" end="00:47:19.990" style="s2">numbers for reality with the quantified</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.410" end="00:47:21.010" style="s2">self - so again it&#39;s not numbers are</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.990" end="00:47:23.050" style="s2">great if they&#39;re measuring something</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.010" end="00:47:24.370" style="s2">that&#39;s there and that&#39;s what am i</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.050" end="00:47:25.990" style="s2">concerned with the quantified self is</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.370" end="00:47:29.020" style="s2">like do you know the measurement errors</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.990" end="00:47:31.180" style="s2">on your tools like how often does it</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.020" end="00:47:33.580" style="s2">miss measure your heartbeat how often</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.180" end="00:47:34.990" style="s2">did not capture what it says to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.580" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">capturing I mean the blood sugar</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.990" end="00:47:38.560" style="s2">monitors for example or a segment</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:42.060" style="s2">another psychometric Co metrological</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.560" end="00:47:44.610" style="s2">minutes and it&#39;s dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.060" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">similarly with quantified self devices</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.610" end="00:47:48.570" style="s2">right now and because we want to curate</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:50.730" style="s2">the tools that can help his act so far</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.570" end="00:47:51.930" style="s2">the sensitivity and specificity is not</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.730" end="00:47:53.610" style="s2">good enough for us to feel that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.930" end="00:47:55.170" style="s2">biofeedback optimization is actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.610" end="00:47:58.730" style="s2">optimizing rather than something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.170" end="00:48:00.870" style="s2">a consumer devices of course there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.730" end="00:48:01.980" style="s2">medical grade devices that are very good</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.870" end="00:48:04.200" style="s2">but we&#39;re not seeing good enough</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.980" end="00:48:06.330" style="s2">correlation on many of them yet it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.200" end="00:48:08.100" style="s2">interesting and that&#39;s what measurement</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.330" end="00:48:10.290" style="s2">does and you know I think a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.100" end="00:48:12.210" style="s2">measurement in general and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.290" end="00:48:14.040" style="s2">things that does is it we can trick</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.210" end="00:48:16.830" style="s2">ourselves and it&#39;s a person not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.040" end="00:48:18.180" style="s2">what&#39;s going on sure it&#39;s because you</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.830" end="00:48:19.350" style="s2">actually think you know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.180" end="00:48:21.600" style="s2">and you don&#39;t and that&#39;s why Demi</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.350" end="00:48:22.980" style="s2">realities can be weird and so I love the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.600" end="00:48:25.800" style="s2">quantified self insofar as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.980" end="00:48:28.170" style="s2">reflective and it creates that virtuous</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.800" end="00:48:29.910" style="s2">cycle but if you&#39;re creating a cycle on</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.170" end="00:48:31.590" style="s2">feedback that&#39;s not accurate then you</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.910" end="00:48:34.290" style="s2">can get off course but someone could</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.590" end="00:48:38.190" style="s2">have a qualified self feedback that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.290" end="00:48:39.780" style="s2">also wrong where&#39;s but that is actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.190" end="00:48:41.790" style="s2">a kind of addictive feel-good rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.780" end="00:48:44.040" style="s2">than a virtuous cycle and they optimize</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.790" end="00:48:46.170" style="s2">so this is why you need layers of</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.040" end="00:48:47.550" style="s2">self-reflection yeah well and the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.170" end="00:48:50.130" style="s2">cycle that drive learning drives</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.550" end="00:48:52.500" style="s2">addiction right it&#39;s the kind of system</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.130" end="00:48:55.110" style="s2">dawson&#39;s refrain and love how learning</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.500" end="00:48:58.680" style="s2">works you need to actually kind of co-op</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.110" end="00:49:01.140" style="s2">that kind of yeah opioid cycle into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.680" end="00:49:03.060" style="s2">dopey yeah dopamine opiates I go into</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.140" end="00:49:04.530" style="s2">these learning the virtuous cycles as</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.060" end="00:49:06.990" style="s2">opposed to and other things like for</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.530" end="00:49:09.060" style="s2">example video game a research and design</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.990" end="00:49:11.700" style="s2">they figured out how to capture really</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.060" end="00:49:13.290" style="s2">well and it&#39;s about that zone of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.700" end="00:49:16.020" style="s2">proximal development or the quotient</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.290" end="00:49:18.510" style="s2">Goldilocks zone which is that zone</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.020" end="00:49:20.280" style="s2">that&#39;s not too hard but not too easy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.510" end="00:49:21.630" style="s2">so if you know about your own learning</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.280" end="00:49:25.020" style="s2">you can put yourself in that situation</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.630" end="00:49:26.520" style="s2">all the time where you are not in over</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.020" end="00:49:29.130" style="s2">your head and challenge to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.520" end="00:49:31.140" style="s2">giving up but not it&#39;s easy to explored</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.130" end="00:49:32.760" style="s2">and so you&#39;re not learning that&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.140" end="00:49:34.200" style="s2">that again just an example of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.760" end="00:49:36.180" style="s2">being reflected by John learning and</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.770" end="00:49:50.790" style="s2">that have some early indicators that</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.600" end="00:49:54.150" style="s2">they elevate IQ using that shitty old</p>

<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:06.270" style="s2">neurofeedback there was statistically</p>

<p begin="00:50:06.270" end="00:50:11.220" style="s2">supposedly doesn&#39;t change there is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.240" end="00:50:13.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a technology that website called</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.220" end="00:50:15.330" style="s2">zing up and it&#39;s basically sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.260" end="00:50:16.920" style="s2">coordination activities that supposedly</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.330" end="00:50:18.750" style="s2">drive neurogenesis and where I should</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.920" end="00:50:20.610" style="s2">increase hippocampal volume because</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.590" end="00:50:29.550" style="s2">should develop elevation of IQ amongst</p>

<p begin="00:50:29.550" end="00:50:32.550" style="s2">right there&#39;s a plausibility that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.930" end="00:50:34.080" style="s2">neurofeedback if you&#39;re actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.550" end="00:50:36.120" style="s2">signal from the brain feeding back to</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.080" end="00:50:37.860" style="s2">the brains the brain gets a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.120" end="00:50:40.680" style="s2">sensory bandwidths that it didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.860" end="00:50:42.600" style="s2">to refine its own process so you get</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:57.300" style="s2">right just process information input it</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.100" end="00:50:59.580" style="s2">makes sense that if you&#39;re increasing</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.300" end="00:51:01.350" style="s2">neurogenesis and you&#39;re getting actual</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.580" end="00:51:03.750" style="s2">gray matter density increases you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.350" end="00:51:05.670" style="s2">increase the you know the computational</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.750" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">Bandits of the system what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.670" end="00:51:11.010" style="s2">of these kinds of things and are there</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:15.060" style="s2">things that you that you know of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.010" end="00:51:16.980" style="s2">you think are meaningful intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.060" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">developing capacities that are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.980" end="00:51:24.630" style="s2">physiologically oriented that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:29.910" style="s2">so I love biofeedback I think you know I</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.630" end="00:51:31.680" style="s2">think many forms of let&#39;s say mental</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.910" end="00:51:34.580" style="s2">distress extreme states of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.680" end="00:51:36.450" style="s2">you know the things that people seek</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.580" end="00:51:38.490" style="s2">psychopharmacology for typically from a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.450" end="00:51:40.740" style="s2">psychiatrist these are these are issues</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.490" end="00:51:42.270" style="s2">with the brain often physiological</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.740" end="00:51:43.890" style="s2">issues now that means we need to treat</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.270" end="00:51:45.120" style="s2">them somehow by working on the brain I</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.890" end="00:51:47.400" style="s2">don&#39;t think that means we need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.120" end="00:51:49.770" style="s2">intervene necessarily some drastic</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.400" end="00:51:51.780" style="s2">chemical way I think there are ways to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.770" end="00:51:54.090" style="s2">do it that are like you&#39;re saying brain</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.780" end="00:51:56.130" style="s2">and train them that are not let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.090" end="00:51:58.650" style="s2">cognitive behavioral therapy but much</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.130" end="00:52:01.980" style="s2">more like letting the brain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.650" end="00:52:03.230" style="s2">perceive itself as it were and work in</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.980" end="00:52:05.450" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.230" end="00:52:06.920" style="s2">I think the way you describe how</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.450" end="00:52:08.600" style="s2">probable it works is probably correct</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.920" end="00:52:10.970" style="s2">now we have to remember of course that</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.600" end="00:52:13.010" style="s2">they&#39;re moving IQ tests we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.970" end="00:52:14.600" style="s2">necessarily living IQ and so I think we</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.010" end="00:52:16.790" style="s2">need to have the quality on on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.600" end="00:52:18.530" style="s2">inside of that quanta which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.790" end="00:52:20.630" style="s2">what does it feel like after going</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.530" end="00:52:23.480" style="s2">through those types of biofeedback</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.630" end="00:52:26.420" style="s2">techniques do you feel more capacitated</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.480" end="00:52:29.450" style="s2">more lucid and insightful for example</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.420" end="00:52:31.550" style="s2">and that&#39;s I think that the proof is in</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.450" end="00:52:33.530" style="s2">that pudding and also with things like</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.550" end="00:52:35.180" style="s2">predictive validity but I think these</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.530" end="00:52:37.570" style="s2">are the most promising for me of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.180" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">forms of biofeedback you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.570" end="00:52:43.670" style="s2">the brain and the body shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:45.350" style="s2">separated at all and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.670" end="00:52:48.850" style="s2">limits to contemporary neuroscience is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.350" end="00:52:54.190" style="s2">that separation so you know the forms of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.850" end="00:52:58.369" style="s2">somatic practice that get people to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.190" end="00:53:00.650" style="s2">inhabit their bodies more I think have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.369" end="00:53:05.510" style="s2">lot of potential things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.650" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">the spatial dynamics and yoga and Tai</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.510" end="00:53:11.119" style="s2">Chi you know which bring the brain back</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">into the body and not out of it into</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.119" end="00:53:16.640" style="s2">some to just feedback and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:17.990" style="s2">know so I think one of the issues we</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.640" end="00:53:21.200" style="s2">have and one of the reasons were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.990" end="00:53:23.030" style="s2">kind of an epidemic of I think cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.200" end="00:53:26.390" style="s2">underperformance let&#39;s put it that way a</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.030" end="00:53:27.890" style="s2">really nice way is the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.390" end="00:53:30.470" style="s2">know people&#39;s bodies themselves are</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.890" end="00:53:33.770" style="s2">hurting before it ever becomes kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.470" end="00:53:37.670" style="s2">neurological thing so that&#39;s will be</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.770" end="00:53:39.170" style="s2">some general advices health mechanistic</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.670" end="00:53:40.460" style="s2">for a minute right if someone&#39;s body is</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.170" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2">actually hurting right they have</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.460" end="00:53:46.010" style="s2">physical pain because of their bad</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:48.980" style="s2">computer organ ominous then we know that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.010" end="00:53:50.480" style="s2">pain is mediated via chemistry and nerve</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.980" end="00:53:52.820" style="s2">signals so you&#39;re gonna be having</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:54.580" style="s2">continuous noise input into the nervous</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.820" end="00:53:57.350" style="s2">system you&#39;re gonna have inflammatory</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.580" end="00:53:58.460" style="s2">chemicals inflammatory cytokines it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.350" end="00:53:59.750" style="s2">cross the blood-brain barrier because</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.460" end="00:54:01.880" style="s2">marrow inflammation and affect all</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.750" end="00:54:03.890" style="s2">aspects of talk-down neurologic function</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.880" end="00:54:06.830" style="s2">including cognitive so getting out of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.890" end="00:54:08.690" style="s2">pain is a way to actually take a load</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.830" end="00:54:10.220" style="s2">off the nervous system increasing its</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.690" end="00:54:12.950" style="s2">capacity and bandwidth to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.220" end="00:54:14.270" style="s2">other stuff so that&#39;s much clearer way</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.950" end="00:54:15.710" style="s2">of what I was trying to say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.270" end="00:54:16.750" style="s2">exactly what I meant by saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.710" end="00:54:19.060" style="s2">know the you</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.750" end="00:54:25.450" style="s2">please but we can think of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.060" end="00:54:27.660" style="s2">mechanisms right so there are there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.450" end="00:54:29.830" style="s2">lot of studies going on regarding</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.660" end="00:54:32.200" style="s2">epigenetics genetic expression from</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.830" end="00:54:35.800" style="s2">various forms of exercise and aerobics</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.200" end="00:54:37.359" style="s2">versus an aerobics versus high-intensity</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.800" end="00:54:40.180" style="s2">interval training actually effects</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.359" end="00:54:42.340" style="s2">different gene expressions and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.180" end="00:54:44.890" style="s2">something like 7,000 genes that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.340" end="00:54:46.060" style="s2">identified actually have epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.890" end="00:54:48.040" style="s2">modulation with different forms of</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.060" end="00:54:49.750" style="s2">exercise so that means that whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.040" end="00:54:52.810" style="s2">thought was it may be genetically</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.750" end="00:54:55.570" style="s2">attributable as an eight is also not fix</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.810" end="00:54:57.849" style="s2">it right it&#39;s changeable and it might so</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.570" end="00:54:59.619" style="s2">the your yoga might be affecting some of</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.849" end="00:55:02.290" style="s2">those things through the breath through</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.619" end="00:55:04.359" style="s2">the parasympathetic processes that are</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.290" end="00:55:06.369" style="s2">happening from the slow movement and the</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.250" end="00:55:12.340" style="s2">might also see though that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.720" end="00:55:14.200" style="s2">certain kinds of benefits that high</p>

<p begin="00:55:14.200" end="00:55:19.180" style="s2">increasing right like the good stress on</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.900" end="00:55:22.210" style="s2">the system that leads to up oblation let</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.180" end="00:55:24.369" style="s2">me set a capacity the yoga doesn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.210" end="00:55:26.950" style="s2">so you&#39;ve but like I&#39;m gonna make a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.369" end="00:55:29.260" style="s2">distinction between things that increase</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.950" end="00:55:31.030" style="s2">capacity where the capacity was already</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.780" end="00:55:48.520" style="s2">we&#39;re wanting to increase baseline so</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.400" end="00:55:50.349" style="s2">I&#39;m curious as you as you forecast into</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.520" end="00:55:54.220" style="s2">the future and you think about some of</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.349" end="00:55:58.869" style="s2">the developmental possibilities there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.220" end="00:56:00.550" style="s2">obviously like pretty wild future tech</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.869" end="00:56:03.580" style="s2">scenarios that are actually getting not</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.550" end="00:56:06.520" style="s2">that far out right like brain brain chip</p>

<p begin="00:56:08.080" end="00:56:11.740" style="s2">heavily and where you would just augment</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.580" end="00:56:13.089" style="s2">your processing capacity with the</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.740" end="00:56:15.790" style="s2">processing capacity of the entire cloud</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.089" end="00:56:17.349" style="s2">running on quantum computers outside of</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.790" end="00:56:20.500" style="s2">that right let&#39;s assume that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.349" end="00:56:22.119" style="s2">get that ever or anytime soon and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.500" end="00:56:26.830" style="s2">looking at increasing endogenous</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.119" end="00:56:30.370" style="s2">processing capacity of this system what</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.830" end="00:56:32.170" style="s2">do you foresee if if things</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.370" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">well in terms of us being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.170" end="00:56:36.820" style="s2">decreased stress better medical systems</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:39.240" style="s2">better schooling education psychological</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.820" end="00:56:42.520" style="s2">development what do you see in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.240" end="00:56:45.700" style="s2">then not-too-distant future human</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.520" end="00:56:47.800" style="s2">intelligence as what would the general</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.700" end="00:56:49.660" style="s2">capacity look like and what might some</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.800" end="00:56:53.710" style="s2">of the modalities that we starting aging</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.660" end="00:56:55.840" style="s2">will look like right right I said I mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.710" end="00:56:58.360" style="s2">yeah so the kind of concrete utopian</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.840" end="00:57:00.010" style="s2">vision of the future of intelligence you</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.360" end="00:57:02.380" style="s2">know would be one where the broad</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.010" end="00:57:04.330" style="s2">baseline is raised in a huge way right</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.380" end="00:57:06.430" style="s2">so we have a basic income guarantee and</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.330" end="00:57:07.870" style="s2">kind of an integral social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.430" end="00:57:09.820" style="s2">and some of these other social miracles</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.870" end="00:57:12.460" style="s2">that I&#39;ve written about we would look at</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.820" end="00:57:15.490" style="s2">something like a broad kind of grazing</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.460" end="00:57:17.230" style="s2">of the floor of what called general</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.490" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">intelligence just because so much as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.230" end="00:57:21.880" style="s2">result of that you know but I think for</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.960" end="00:57:24.600" style="s2">the individuals looking at the cutting</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.880" end="00:57:27.910" style="s2">edge you know I think it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.600" end="00:57:30.160" style="s2">horizontal and vertical growth in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.910" end="00:57:33.870" style="s2">simplistic way that&#39;s kind of stereotype</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.160" end="00:57:36.730" style="s2">but we don&#39;t know the range of people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.870" end="00:57:38.920" style="s2">multiple intelligences which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.730" end="00:57:40.660" style="s2">the first step for many people is just</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.920" end="00:57:42.730" style="s2">to explore lines that they have not</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.660" end="00:57:45.400" style="s2">explored right so it&#39;s not they keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.730" end="00:57:49.450" style="s2">going up we can talk about that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.400" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">about going going wider right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.450" end="00:57:52.780" style="s2">we already discussed this briefly but</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:54.250" style="s2">that I think is something that people</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.780" end="00:57:55.990" style="s2">will have the freedom to do in a way</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.250" end="00:57:58.150" style="s2">they&#39;ve never had before if some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.990" end="00:58:00.970" style="s2">these other things get sorted out why do</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.150" end="00:58:03.160" style="s2">they intentionally cross applying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.970" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">give the intentional crossing of line in</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.160" end="00:58:07.720" style="s2">a space not a scarcity where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.160" end="00:58:09.730" style="s2">frantically trying to keep your job and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.720" end="00:58:12.130" style="s2">how could I possibly take up yoga right</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.730" end="00:58:16.060" style="s2">but in a space of educational abundance</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.130" end="00:58:18.460" style="s2">where your unique skull you like the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.060" end="00:58:20.560" style="s2">unique skill profile that you have as a</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.460" end="00:58:22.690" style="s2">potential could actually be expressed I</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.560" end="00:58:25.180" style="s2">think what we&#39;re looking at now are kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.690" end="00:58:27.610" style="s2">of truncated skill profiles where a lot</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.180" end="00:58:29.530" style="s2">of potentials are not expressed for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.610" end="00:58:31.990" style="s2">variety of reasons so I think the first</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.530" end="00:58:33.760" style="s2">issue is to kind of fill that out which</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.990" end="00:58:37.330" style="s2">is to say to fill out the rest of your</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.760" end="00:58:40.330" style="s2">kind of profile of what you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.330" end="00:58:43.150" style="s2">capable of doing and that may mean you</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.330" end="00:58:45.490" style="s2">work in hospice care or it may mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.150" end="00:58:47.830" style="s2">working soup kitchen maybe playing</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.490" end="00:58:50.110" style="s2">soccer right I mean who knows but the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.830" end="00:58:54.190" style="s2">point being that you know we&#39;re limited</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.110" end="00:58:55.780" style="s2">in the ways we can grow often by this</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.190" end="00:58:59.350" style="s2">sense of educational scarcity that</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.780" end="00:59:01.510" style="s2">surrounds us is limits of time so you</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.350" end="00:59:04.330" style="s2">know I&#39;ll have no problem</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.510" end="00:59:05.860" style="s2">go for it expand horizontally I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.330" end="00:59:08.200" style="s2">another thing again this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.860" end="00:59:09.730" style="s2">unexplored kind of educational frontier</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.200" end="00:59:12.640" style="s2">right another place where we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.730" end="00:59:15.160" style="s2">explored as States right so do a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.930" style="s2">learning and skill development but state</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.160" end="00:59:20.800" style="s2">experiences which is the same meditative</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.930" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">States right and other forms of flow</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.800" end="00:59:25.900" style="s2">which is another state that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:27.850" style="s2">popular these days to speak about you</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.900" end="00:59:29.890" style="s2">know these the exploration of state</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.850" end="00:59:32.770" style="s2">experiences and the way these interface</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.890" end="00:59:34.660" style="s2">with capacity development I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.770" end="00:59:36.790" style="s2">another place for people to if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.660" end="00:59:40.090" style="s2">topped out at a certain capacity let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.790" end="00:59:42.850" style="s2">say start to bring in a state practice</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.090" end="00:59:45.730" style="s2">which brings that capacity to operate</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.850" end="00:59:48.580" style="s2">under a different state and then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.730" end="00:59:50.650" style="s2">find new potential emergence all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.580" end="00:59:52.990" style="s2">and there&#39;s another thing that our</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.650" end="00:59:54.730" style="s2">schooling at society doesn&#39;t give us</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.990" end="00:59:56.350" style="s2">explicitly but that we&#39;re seeking on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.730" end="00:59:58.780" style="s2">side all the time I mean sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.350" end="01:00:01.450" style="s2">explicitly been meditation but rock</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.780" end="01:00:03.910" style="s2">concerts movies all of these things are</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.450" end="01:00:06.430" style="s2">subtle state inducing causal state</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.910" end="01:00:09.780" style="s2">losing so I think there&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.430" end="01:00:13.450" style="s2">when we&#39;re not as concerned with</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.780" end="01:00:16.740" style="s2">manipulating and kind of you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.450" end="01:00:20.620" style="s2">competing and when there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.740" end="01:00:22.300" style="s2">educational abundance then the value of</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.620" end="01:00:24.370" style="s2">those state experiences aesthetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.300" end="01:00:26.680" style="s2">experience as a state experience and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.370" end="01:00:28.660" style="s2">rapture of a sunset is a state</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.680" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">experience like the value and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.660" end="01:00:32.670" style="s2">intrinsic value of those things will</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:35.860" style="s2">become clearer and clearer and clearer</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.670" end="01:00:38.500" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard you have to searching for</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.860" end="01:00:41.140" style="s2">those now and I think that but I just</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.500" end="01:00:44.950" style="s2">want to reiterate in slightly different</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.140" end="01:00:46.360" style="s2">words which is that much of how we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.950" end="01:00:48.580" style="s2">been developing ourselves as like</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.360" end="01:00:50.140" style="s2">monoculture in our mind right like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.580" end="01:00:53.170" style="s2">trying to produce this thing so we are</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.140" end="01:00:54.100" style="s2">just growing hybridized GM wheat fields</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.170" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.100" end="01:01:01.170" style="s2">and not developing a robust complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.640" style="s2">ecosystem that can actually resist</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.170" end="01:01:05.890" style="s2">foreign species when they come in and</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.640" end="01:01:07.240" style="s2">has resilience across a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.890" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">capacity so one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.240" end="01:01:12.130" style="s2">you&#39;re wanting is that people don&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:14.860" style="s2">trying to just optimize the total amount</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.130" end="01:01:16.930" style="s2">of wheat yield of their mind but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.860" end="01:01:19.960" style="s2">actually seeking to optimize a lot more</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.930" end="01:01:21.340" style="s2">complex set of things well you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.960" end="01:01:24.280" style="s2">even really call it optimized and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.340" end="01:01:27.160" style="s2">would call it exploring yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.280" end="01:01:28.900" style="s2">I think good for a few reasons you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.160" end="01:01:31.090" style="s2">one is that the world we&#39;re moving into</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.900" end="01:01:33.910" style="s2">is not a world where monocultures are</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.090" end="01:01:36.490" style="s2">gonna survive on multiple levels and an</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.910" end="01:01:40.180" style="s2">analogy so apt because the monoculture</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.490" end="01:01:42.580" style="s2">of Agriculture came around the same time</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.180" end="01:01:44.590" style="s2">that we got these mass you know kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.580" end="01:01:46.990" style="s2">post or high schools and so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.590" end="01:01:48.840" style="s2">looking at literally the generation of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.990" end="01:01:52.150" style="s2">monoculture of the mind</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.840" end="01:01:54.280" style="s2">so that&#39;s deep and so yeah so it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.150" end="01:01:57.700" style="s2">breaking out of that monoculture into</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.280" end="01:01:59.620" style="s2">this much more kind of symbiotic way of</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.700" end="01:02:02.080" style="s2">thinking about where is my niche and has</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.620" end="01:02:04.990" style="s2">a niche can change as the culture around</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.080" end="01:02:07.930" style="s2">me changes as I grow and grow more and</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.990" end="01:02:11.530" style="s2">so it&#39;s very much moving away from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.930" end="01:02:13.510" style="s2">static kind of almost arithmetic &#39;el</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.530" end="01:02:14.710" style="s2">like like in a sense of arithmetic way</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.510" end="01:02:17.340" style="s2">of thinking about the mind into a</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.710" end="01:02:20.440" style="s2">dynamical way of thinking about the mind</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.340" end="01:02:22.210" style="s2">so yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s a good good</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.440" end="01:02:24.280" style="s2">insight and so it&#39;s about exploration</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.210" end="01:02:26.260" style="s2">but it&#39;s an exploration the hope of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.280" end="01:02:28.120" style="s2">finding which is to say that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.260" end="01:02:29.290" style="s2">searcher than you find them and also and</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.120" end="01:02:31.690" style="s2">something grows that never would have</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.290" end="01:02:33.790" style="s2">grown which may be exactly what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.690" end="01:02:35.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s I think the fear of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.790" end="01:02:36.250" style="s2">monocultures that&#39;s not resilient</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.170" end="01:02:38.860" style="s2">there&#39;s all these reasons that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.250" end="01:02:41.590" style="s2">literally dangerous so if you can only</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.860" end="01:02:44.560" style="s2">do one thing if you can only give one</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.590" end="01:02:47.380" style="s2">food to the world and or only eat one</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.560" end="01:02:49.900" style="s2">kind of food from the world then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.380" end="01:02:51.540" style="s2">very in a precarious situation so we</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.900" end="01:02:55.420" style="s2">need to all become very much you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.540" end="01:02:57.910" style="s2">very broad and I think the Renaissance</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.420" end="01:02:59.320" style="s2">man it&#39;s like necessary for everybody so</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.910" end="01:03:00.610" style="s2">I agree we this and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.320" end="01:03:02.410" style="s2">interesting question I wanna bring up I</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.610" end="01:03:04.420" style="s2">have two friends where I&#39;ve had this</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.410" end="01:03:06.970" style="s2">conversation in the last few weeks who</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.420" end="01:03:09.970" style="s2">have something like six standard</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.970" end="01:03:13.630" style="s2">deviations more computational processing</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.970" end="01:03:16.200" style="s2">power than most people off of normal</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.630" end="01:03:18.940" style="s2">assessment curves they also have other</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.200" end="01:03:20.920" style="s2">underdeveloped capacities as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.940" end="01:03:23.590" style="s2">how they&#39;ve developed that and a both</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.920" end="01:03:25.120" style="s2">expressed fear in doing things that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.590" end="01:03:26.770" style="s2">would develop those other capacities</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.120" end="01:03:28.270" style="s2">because if not wanting to lose the</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.770" end="01:03:29.650" style="s2">unique capacities that they&#39;ve developed</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.270" end="01:03:33.100" style="s2">or there&#39;s a question of like have I</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.650" end="01:03:36.130" style="s2">have I allocated all of my neural</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.100" end="01:03:38.230" style="s2">process in some zero sum or even if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.130" end="01:03:40.990" style="s2">positive some fixed you know positive</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.230" end="01:03:43.690" style="s2">some kind of way where I am now a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.990" end="01:03:45.340" style="s2">useful tool and if I were to reallocate</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.690" end="01:03:47.410" style="s2">it it might make me feel better but I</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.340" end="01:03:50.800" style="s2">would actually be a less useful tool Zhi</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.410" end="01:03:54.250" style="s2">Hao founded do you think that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.800" end="01:03:58.000" style="s2">concern in those outlier cases is I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.250" end="01:03:59.530" style="s2">I think again these are deep questions</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.000" end="01:04:01.090" style="s2">in the philosophy of education which is</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.530" end="01:04:03.820" style="s2">about what&#39;s a good person what&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.090" end="01:04:06.280" style="s2">society and I think you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.820" end="01:04:08.740" style="s2">put a square peg in a round hole so</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.280" end="01:04:09.790" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s a uniqueness factor</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.740" end="01:04:14.140" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of where does the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.790" end="01:04:15.580" style="s2">puzzle piece fit factor but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.140" end="01:04:17.620" style="s2">something true also about that fear I</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.580" end="01:04:19.240" style="s2">this is kind of a far transfer of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.620" end="01:04:21.490" style="s2">word but I remember David Lynch ride the</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.240" end="01:04:24.070" style="s2">great film director he went to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.490" end="01:04:26.950" style="s2">psychotherapy and he was like you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.070" end="01:04:28.570" style="s2">if I do this you know well my art suffer</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.950" end="01:04:32.170" style="s2">and the therapist was like maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.570" end="01:04:34.870" style="s2">know and he was like nope not done and</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.170" end="01:04:39.460" style="s2">so he was willing to like live with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.870" end="01:04:41.230" style="s2">wound to do the art and so I think some</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.460" end="01:04:43.120" style="s2">people may be willing to live with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.230" end="01:04:46.930" style="s2">kind of truncated a whole set of skills</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.120" end="01:04:48.580" style="s2">and kind of withered limb as it were in</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.930" end="01:04:49.960" style="s2">order to have this super strong branch</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.580" end="01:04:52.420" style="s2">over here holding up something that</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.960" end="01:04:54.310" style="s2">needs to be held up so I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.420" end="01:04:56.920" style="s2">nod we don&#39;t want our modulus you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.310" end="01:04:58.540" style="s2">but the question is then about what does</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.920" end="01:05:00.700" style="s2">it feel like to be them and there are</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.540" end="01:05:03.880" style="s2">other things that if they could change</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.700" end="01:05:05.830" style="s2">them and not lose that they would and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.880" end="01:05:07.210" style="s2">I&#39;d have a conversation that would but</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.830" end="01:05:09.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a deep question and I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.210" end="01:05:10.000" style="s2">looking at a society of increasing</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.040" end="01:05:13.170" style="s2">neurodiversity</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.000" end="01:05:16.170" style="s2">an increasing kind of unique individual</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.170" end="01:05:18.610" style="s2">niche fitting and so we need to be</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.170" end="01:05:20.660" style="s2">careful and judicious about trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.610" end="01:05:23.500" style="s2">fit square pegs and around all</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.660" end="01:05:26.840" style="s2">and trying to maybe perhaps make new</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.500" end="01:05:29.780" style="s2">shapes you know fit the shape more to</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.840" end="01:05:32.480" style="s2">this unique neural profile then to what</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.780" end="01:05:34.940" style="s2">you know the machine needs and again the</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.480" end="01:05:37.250" style="s2">machine is that arithmetic mentality the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.940" end="01:05:39.560" style="s2">machine whereas the dynamical mentality</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.250" end="01:05:43.250" style="s2">is one where there&#39;s a kind of co-active</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.560" end="01:05:46.490" style="s2">system between both so yeah this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.250" end="01:05:48.530" style="s2">again educational futures for those who</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.490" end="01:05:50.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have the language machine is a</p>

<p begin="01:06:20.990" end="01:06:24.290" style="s2">understand complex systems so you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:07:14.420" end="01:07:19.130" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s again that&#39;s both of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.970" end="01:07:21.380" style="s2">kind of brilliance of the IQ and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.130" end="01:07:23.390" style="s2">tragedy is that it&#39;s simplified this</p>

<p begin="01:07:28.580" end="01:07:33.740" style="s2">you have the mind is not like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.980" end="01:07:35.810" style="s2">not complicated it&#39;s radically complex I</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.740" end="01:07:37.369" style="s2">it&#39;s literally the most complex thing in</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.369" end="01:07:42.200" style="s2">itself Rises this is the brain and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.619" end="01:07:44.690" style="s2">the inside of the brain is that now</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.200" end="01:07:46.820" style="s2">again start to do some state practices</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.690" end="01:07:48.980" style="s2">and you&#39;ll see that there&#39;s there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.820" end="01:07:52.940" style="s2">of that so it&#39;s just very interesting to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.980" end="01:07:55.340" style="s2">think about what that future of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.940" end="01:07:58.490" style="s2">brain in education is you said one thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.340" end="01:08:00.260" style="s2">that was so important which was you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.490" end="01:08:02.570" style="s2">like complicated versus complex that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.260" end="01:08:04.190" style="s2">one big distinction but one of the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.570" end="01:08:06.740" style="s2">distinctions was intrinsic versus</p>

<p begin="01:08:47.170" end="01:08:53.060" style="s2">intrinsic experience as well as</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.980" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">developing their capacities for</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.060" end="01:08:56.990" style="s2">extrinsic utility but not mostly just</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:59.480" style="s2">seeing them as utilities for the future</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.990" end="01:09:01.220" style="s2">of economy or military or whatever but</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.480" end="01:09:04.160" style="s2">then also for all of us as adults we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.220" end="01:09:07.880" style="s2">paying more attention to balance just to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.160" end="01:09:09.380" style="s2">cram yeah absolutely I think we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.880" end="01:09:10.910" style="s2">know extrinsic motivation is part of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.380" end="01:09:11.930" style="s2">what it means to be alive you know I</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.910" end="01:09:14.720" style="s2">mean there&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.930" end="01:09:16.250" style="s2">extrinsic motivations but if that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.720" end="01:09:18.859" style="s2">you have it can become very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.250" end="01:09:20.690" style="s2">and it&#39;s a classic principle and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.859" end="01:09:22.540" style="s2">psychotherapy if you&#39;re totally</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.690" end="01:09:25.700" style="s2">dependent upon the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.540" end="01:09:28.609" style="s2">you know you&#39;re very vulnerable it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.700" end="01:09:30.200" style="s2">very precarious situation and it feels</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.609" end="01:09:34.270" style="s2">that way when you&#39;re trapped in a</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.200" end="01:09:36.410" style="s2">situation of time to extract a value so</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.270" end="01:09:38.420" style="s2">freeing your goals from that</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.410" end="01:09:40.310" style="s2">transcending but including extrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.420" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">value right which is the site you get</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.310" end="01:09:45.859" style="s2">that and then you move beyond it and you</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:46.890" style="s2">include the kind of getting the</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.859" end="01:09:48.930" style="s2">extrinsic scale you</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.890" end="01:09:51.870" style="s2">include that within this broader project</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.930" end="01:09:53.400" style="s2">that&#39;s intrinsic and similar to that</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.870" end="01:09:55.410" style="s2">transfer thing we discussed before</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.400" end="01:09:59.940" style="s2">bringing it all together into a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.410" end="01:10:01.530" style="s2">coherence of development of self so in</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.940" end="01:10:03.090" style="s2">an interesting part you know that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.530" end="01:10:06.660" style="s2">of it you know again as I said the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.090" end="01:10:09.530" style="s2">people who become post conventional you</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.660" end="01:10:13.140" style="s2">find them to be self-directed learners</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.530" end="01:10:15.930" style="s2">and intrinsically motivated and even</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.140" end="01:10:18.630" style="s2">those who are a great example of this is</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.930" end="01:10:21.780" style="s2">dyslexia right i&#39;m dyslexic it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.630" end="01:10:22.530" style="s2">actually true that dyslexic you know who</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.780" end="01:10:24.000" style="s2">succeed</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.530" end="01:10:25.260" style="s2">the reason they succeed is not because</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.000" end="01:10:27.960" style="s2">of the special training they received</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.260" end="01:10:31.290" style="s2">it&#39;s because they attach an intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.960" end="01:10:33.870" style="s2">motivation to something like reading and</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.290" end="01:10:35.820" style="s2">so you find all these stories of you</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.870" end="01:10:37.230" style="s2">know high achievement dyslexics and at</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.820" end="01:10:38.220" style="s2">some point in their childhood they found</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.230" end="01:10:41.160" style="s2">something they were just passionate</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.220" end="01:10:42.990" style="s2">about and so all the pain of school and</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.160" end="01:10:45.150" style="s2">all of that didn&#39;t matter anymore</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.990" end="01:10:47.490" style="s2">because their intrinsic an little bit at</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.150" end="01:10:50.220" style="s2">a low and by the way along the way they</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.490" end="01:10:51.950" style="s2">got these extrinsic things handled but</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.220" end="01:10:55.320" style="s2">they&#39;re doing them for their own reasons</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.950" end="01:10:57.720" style="s2">and so there&#39;s something I think many of</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.320" end="01:11:00.300" style="s2">the people who are the valley crossers</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.720" end="01:11:02.850" style="s2">end up being mavericks and outsiders in</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.300" end="01:11:04.350" style="s2">traditional schooling precisely for this</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.850" end="01:11:07.050" style="s2">reason because they&#39;re doing it for</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.350" end="01:11:09.180" style="s2">their own purposes they&#39;re intrinsically</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.050" end="01:11:10.710" style="s2">motivated and the school demands certain</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.180" end="01:11:12.860" style="s2">extremes of things so that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.710" end="01:11:15.180" style="s2">separation of learning from schooling</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.860" end="01:11:17.220" style="s2">often follows from the separation of</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.180" end="01:11:18.690" style="s2">intrinsic from extreme lack and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.220" end="01:11:21.000" style="s2">the advice I give to most of my friends</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.690" end="01:11:23.460" style="s2">who have kids and like accessory and</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.000" end="01:11:25.500" style="s2">learning from schooling learning is</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.460" end="01:11:27.390" style="s2">awesome schooling sometimes can be</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.500" end="01:11:29.700" style="s2">sometimes not it&#39;s a watch but if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.390" end="01:11:32.100" style="s2">confuse those and think learning so it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.700" end="01:11:33.390" style="s2">takes place in school yeah then you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.100" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">never learn for the rest your life and</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.390" end="01:11:38.730" style="s2">so that intrinsic motivation is huge and</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:40.020" style="s2">but that it&#39;s really deep really quickly</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.730" end="01:11:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem with intrinsic</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.020" end="01:11:45.000" style="s2">motivations and you go directly from you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.960" end="01:11:47.310" style="s2">know simple questions about what am i</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.000" end="01:11:48.930" style="s2">learning too deep questions about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.310" end="01:11:51.420" style="s2">the significance of my life what do I</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.930" end="01:11:53.220" style="s2">really want to be what kind of person am</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.420" end="01:11:55.119" style="s2">I already what can I transform like</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.220" end="01:11:57.369" style="s2">these are the deeper questions</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.119" end="01:11:59.170" style="s2">which the degree that we are wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.369" end="01:12:00.610" style="s2">raise children to fill roles and a</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.170" end="01:12:03.250" style="s2">predefined society we of course don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.610" end="01:12:08.469" style="s2">want them to ask right that&#39;s what they</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.250" end="01:12:11.460" style="s2">have to ask okay this has been a blast</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.469" end="01:12:15.040" style="s2">as we&#39;re wrapping up if people are</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.460" end="01:12:17.170" style="s2">interested in understanding their</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.040" end="01:12:20.530" style="s2">capacities as a baseline to both see</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.170" end="01:12:21.880" style="s2">what is most relevant for them to</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.530" end="01:12:23.110" style="s2">develop and then to see if the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.880" end="01:12:27.670" style="s2">developmental things they&#39;re doing are</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.110" end="01:12:30.730" style="s2">working other than IQ what might you</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.670" end="01:12:34.210" style="s2">recommend to people as ways they can</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.730" end="01:12:35.730" style="s2">assess their intelligence their multiple</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.210" end="01:12:38.409" style="s2">lines of intelligence their ecological</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.730" end="01:12:40.389" style="s2">complexity of thought like what is</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.409" end="01:12:42.730" style="s2">electrically useful tool what are some</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.389" end="01:12:45.190" style="s2">other ones for assessment yeah electic</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.730" end="01:12:46.840" style="s2">a-- so you can go to luck to go dot org</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.190" end="01:12:48.219" style="s2">and i&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be links on the</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.840" end="01:12:49.420" style="s2">neuro hacker website that we can put</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.219" end="01:12:51.310" style="s2">there and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.420" end="01:12:53.550" style="s2">assessment options I like to go which</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.310" end="01:12:55.750" style="s2">they get it that spectrum from</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.550" end="01:12:57.580" style="s2">abstraction and complexity in particular</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.750" end="01:12:59.110" style="s2">lines and these can be useful for self</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.580" end="01:13:00.730" style="s2">diagnostic purposes there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.110" end="01:13:02.739" style="s2">bunch of uses for electrical assessments</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.730" end="01:13:05.020" style="s2">so I think those are important addition</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.739" end="01:13:07.560" style="s2">again it&#39;s about the standardization and</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.020" end="01:13:10.540" style="s2">the psychometric over their valuable</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.560" end="01:13:12.820" style="s2">whose array of assessments out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.540" end="01:13:15.400" style="s2">which you could use in a quantified self</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.820" end="01:13:17.530" style="s2">type way and so I would never discourage</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.400" end="01:13:19.449" style="s2">people from exploring those but I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.530" end="01:13:21.429" style="s2">you know keep in mind all these lessons</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.449" end="01:13:24.670" style="s2">about measurement and measurement of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.429" end="01:13:26.409" style="s2">mind in particular and just take them</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.670" end="01:13:29.889" style="s2">with a grain of salt you know and know</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.409" end="01:13:31.659" style="s2">that you know flying blind</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.889" end="01:13:33.219" style="s2">which is to say without measures is</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.659" end="01:13:36.369" style="s2">better than flying with measures your</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.219" end="01:13:39.040" style="s2">trusts that are wrong and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.369" end="01:13:40.449" style="s2">just true and so play with them but</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.040" end="01:13:45.010" style="s2">really be careful about the ones you</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.449" end="01:13:46.840" style="s2">hang your hat on and you know journaling</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.010" end="01:13:52.090" style="s2">there&#39;s actually extremely important</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.840" end="01:13:55.239" style="s2">developmental catalyst so which is to</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.090" end="01:13:56.800" style="s2">say witness at all note at all seasons</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.239" end="01:13:58.030" style="s2">where you can see what&#39;s not working pay</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.800" end="01:14:00.070" style="s2">attention to yourself and sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.030" end="01:14:01.449" style="s2">journaling where they can help with that</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.070" end="01:14:03.520" style="s2">fundamental way you can do it in a</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.449" end="01:14:05.830" style="s2">structured way and there&#39;s a whole</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.520" end="01:14:07.659" style="s2">approaches to doing that but I found it</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.830" end="01:14:08.360" style="s2">to be valuable for people that I know</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.659" end="01:14:10.980" style="s2">from my</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.360" end="01:14:13.140" style="s2">so that&#39;s just another way of assessment</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.980" end="01:14:15.570" style="s2">you know you talked about the cap of</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.140" end="01:14:17.670" style="s2">quanta and the qualia right and so</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.570" end="01:14:19.500" style="s2">that&#39;s the qualitative assessment</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.670" end="01:14:21.900" style="s2">themself and you can keep it running log</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.500" end="01:14:26.460" style="s2">it around head but writing it down helps</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.900" end="01:14:31.200" style="s2">gets it out and have you seen any</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.460" end="01:14:34.110" style="s2">correlation of things like different</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.200" end="01:14:39.080" style="s2">forms of imaging so say MRIs that are</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.110" end="01:14:41.250" style="s2">looking at neural density QE G&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.080" end="01:14:43.040" style="s2">different forms of psychometric or</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.250" end="01:14:46.380" style="s2">intelligence scores that you think are</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:48.710" style="s2">either already valuable or promising of</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.380" end="01:14:53.220" style="s2">a new kind of mind brain interface</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.710" end="01:14:55.950" style="s2">science I mean this is my room my field</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.220" end="01:14:57.720" style="s2">I haven&#39;t I mean I&#39;ve been really</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.950" end="01:15:00.660" style="s2">intrigued by the meditation research</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.720" end="01:15:03.110" style="s2">that&#39;s coming out of Madison Wisconsin I</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.660" end="01:15:05.520" style="s2">think that&#39;s where it is and that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.240" end="01:15:15.840" style="s2">expect but it&#39;s just shocking to see</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.380" end="01:15:22.620" style="s2">but yeah that&#39;s about as much as I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.610" end="01:15:26.040" style="s2">say you know and so I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.620" end="01:15:27.990" style="s2">old-school methods I think it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.040" end="01:15:29.850" style="s2">my part of it comes from my caution</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.990" end="01:15:32.070" style="s2">around the assessment you know which is</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.850" end="01:15:34.110" style="s2">to say I&#39;m you know the DSM is a</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.070" end="01:15:37.350" style="s2">nightmare the IQ tests are a nightmare</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.110" end="01:15:39.690" style="s2">like don&#39;t caps don&#39;t articulate your</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.350" end="01:15:43.110" style="s2">self understanding in these languages</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.690" end="01:15:44.280" style="s2">handed to you you know find new ways to</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.110" end="01:15:45.780" style="s2">think about myself</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.280" end="01:15:50.760" style="s2">things like Plaxico can help like that</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.780" end="01:15:54.150" style="s2">but Nix and wrong metrics are concerned</p>

<p begin="01:16:01.320" end="01:16:08.100" style="s2">then those are scary foreigners because</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.960" end="01:16:09.750" style="s2">they actually work and so there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.100" end="01:16:12.000" style="s2">many we can just jump down the whole</p>
