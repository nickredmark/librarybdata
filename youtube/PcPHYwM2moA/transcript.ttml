<p begin="00:03:11.560" end="00:03:16.750" style="s2">and how do our people think they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.079" end="00:03:18.790" style="s2">ridiculous we need a better way to one</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.750" end="00:03:21.060" style="s2">just you know the truth that every</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.790" end="00:03:23.350" style="s2">broadcast doesn&#39;t need to say okay like</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.060" end="00:03:26.380" style="s2">you can&#39;t just spin the truth for your</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.350" end="00:03:27.730" style="s2">broadcast so having a way to know like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.380" end="00:03:29.590" style="s2">how long have those people lived there</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.730" end="00:03:32.230" style="s2">where are they from where are they and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.590" end="00:03:34.209" style="s2">whether that gives them any any claim to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.230" end="00:03:39.730" style="s2">anything like every human born on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.209" end="00:03:42.130" style="s2">planet needs a place to be and in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.730" end="00:03:46.900" style="s2">that&#39;s reflected in our treatment</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.130" end="00:03:49.120" style="s2">reconciliation that like there is no</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.900" end="00:03:51.880" style="s2">place for most of us to go to like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.120" end="00:03:54.609" style="s2">Canadian this is my soil this is but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.880" end="00:03:56.859" style="s2">was also stolen partly from some of my</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.609" end="00:04:00.220" style="s2">ancestors but actually isn&#39;t that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.859" end="00:04:02.620" style="s2">kind of stolen for my ancestors and so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.220" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">don&#39;t know just everything all at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.620" end="00:04:09.910" style="s2">same time but I also see solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2">feeling the burden of trying to get my</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.910" end="00:04:15.010" style="s2">ideas out there fast enough to not feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:20.169" style="s2">responsible for every genocide and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.010" end="00:04:21.489" style="s2">hurricane and he&#39;s to feel like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.169" end="00:04:22.510" style="s2">something we can do when something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.489" end="00:04:23.410" style="s2">that happens it clearly in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.510" end="00:04:24.850" style="s2">Hurricanes I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:28.390" style="s2">I think the difference in this hurricane</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:30.760" style="s2">versus the Katrina hurricane is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.390" end="00:04:32.080" style="s2">people weren&#39;t just waiting for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.760" end="00:04:34.120" style="s2">government to take action people were</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.980" style="s2">out in their boats saving people because</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.120" end="00:04:38.070" style="s2">they realized the Coast Guard and Army</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.980" end="00:04:40.810" style="s2">weren&#39;t gonna be there in time it takes</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.070" end="00:04:43.030" style="s2">bureaucracy so long to act whereas we</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.810" end="00:04:46.300" style="s2">can act the day the day it happens we</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.030" end="00:04:48.520" style="s2">can act until until you stop this</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.300" end="00:04:49.750" style="s2">genocide like we&#39;re not buying a product</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.520" end="00:04:51.010" style="s2">I don&#39;t even know what do we buy from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.750" end="00:04:53.830" style="s2">tomorrow what did they what do they get</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.010" end="00:04:55.660" style="s2">what do they export what did they import</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.830" end="00:04:57.250" style="s2">because you&#39;re also you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.660" end="00:04:59.800" style="s2">owners of companies could say I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.250" end="00:05:01.270" style="s2">going to sell to you but as consumers we</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.800" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">can say we&#39;re not going to buy from you</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.270" end="00:05:06.640" style="s2">and that can be instant but updates your</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:08.440" style="s2">app right like that&#39;s an action we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.640" end="00:05:13.480" style="s2">take that has a meaning in the real</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.440" end="00:05:18.010" style="s2">world we can mobilize resources once</p>
