<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">to me and then you can push it</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:28.240" style="s2">later right you recover or you don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">then you test it and see</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.240" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">if you listen to the doctors you get</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">worse and worse and you&#39;re expected to</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:34.000" style="s2">ex</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:35.200" style="s2">to listen to them so then you just keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.000" end="00:01:35.600" style="s2">thinking okay well i&#39;m not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.200" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.600" end="00:01:38.799" style="s2">and keep pushing it and pushing it those</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">are the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.799" end="00:01:43.840" style="s2">who don&#39;t recover or are less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:45.920" style="s2">recover</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.840" end="00:01:47.520" style="s2">so you have to learn how to pace and</p>

<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">until you&#39;ve learned to calm it down</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">and then hopefully you can learn to your</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">inner voice and it does tell you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">when you can add stuff back in</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:42.239" style="s2">it can be a blessing for that very</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:43.040" style="s2">reason it forces you to listen to your</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.239" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">own inner voice</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.040" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">and it forces you to put your own oxygen</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:50.239" style="s2">mask on first</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:52.000" style="s2">to learn what gives you safety</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:10.159" style="s2">is a pretty good feeling no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">even if you&#39;re in pain and fatigued</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.159" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s better than the opposite</p>

<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">spoons on those things</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">do not push yourself through it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">and find the community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.479" end="00:04:33.600" style="s2">experienced this</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">and so that you at least have some peers</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.600" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">so when the doctors are telling you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">you&#39;re crazy there&#39;s at least of like</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.080" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">all at the same time because of cobit 19</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">maybe the doctors catch up and they stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.639" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">offering better advice</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">but that&#39;s not happening yet so please</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:59.360" style="s2">find the chronic fatigue communities</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">find the myalgic encephalitis</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.360" end="00:05:03.919" style="s2">communities</p>
