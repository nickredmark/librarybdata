<p begin="00:00:50.090" end="00:00:52.730" style="s2">polarization and what we might do about</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.880" end="00:01:01.910" style="s2">very much part of the story of how I</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.380" end="00:01:04.100" style="s2">ended up working on this because then</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.910" end="00:01:06.770" style="s2">after the myth gap I spent a year as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.100" end="00:01:08.750" style="s2">campaign director at of ours the 47</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.750" end="00:01:12.680" style="s2">and part of my job that was running its</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.010" end="00:01:14.840" style="s2">brexit campaign and my brief was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.680" end="00:01:17.990" style="s2">clear it was fight for the UK to remain</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.840" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">in the EU but it was as I was doing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.990" end="00:01:21.920" style="s2">that I developed these increasing</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.750" style="s2">misgivings about you know well actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.920" end="00:01:26.330" style="s2">if we have a second referendum on brexit</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.750" end="00:01:29.390" style="s2">is that really going to heal this kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.330" end="00:01:31.520" style="s2">of septic wound in our politics and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.390" end="00:01:33.970" style="s2">I took a sabbatical for six months and</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.520" end="00:01:36.530" style="s2">went to live in Jerusalem with my family</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.970" end="00:01:38.150" style="s2">for that period and obviously the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.530" end="00:01:40.880" style="s2">political polarization there is even</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.150" end="00:01:43.610" style="s2">more extreme and at one level that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.880" end="00:01:46.040" style="s2">incredibly depressing and I could see</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.610" end="00:01:47.360" style="s2">the kind of similarities with brexit or</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.040" end="00:01:50.000" style="s2">with Trump&#39;s America I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.360" end="00:01:52.100" style="s2">it&#39;s more extreme in Israel and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.000" end="00:01:54.260" style="s2">Palestine but nevertheless I felt like</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.100" end="00:01:57.860" style="s2">it was on the same spectrum in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.260" end="00:01:59.720" style="s2">sense but what was hopeful when I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.860" end="00:02:02.240" style="s2">there was finding the work of a few</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.720" end="00:02:04.930" style="s2">psychologists people like Gina Ross who</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.240" end="00:02:07.820" style="s2">are arguing that really to understand</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.930" end="00:02:09.349" style="s2">polarization there you can&#39;t divorce it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.820" end="00:02:11.779" style="s2">from its mental health context</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.349" end="00:02:13.790" style="s2">particularly the fact that continuous</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.779" end="00:02:14.990" style="s2">traumatic stress which is a bit like</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.790" end="00:02:16.850" style="s2">post-traumatic stress</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.990" end="00:02:20.540" style="s2">when it&#39;s not post when it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.850" end="00:02:23.780" style="s2">everyday ongoing reality but of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.540" end="00:02:26.150" style="s2">that catalyzes polarization because the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.780" end="00:02:28.880" style="s2">classic symptoms of continuous traumatic</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.150" end="00:02:30.950" style="s2">stress are things like anxiety and type</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.880" end="00:02:32.800" style="s2">of vigilance and especially other ring</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.950" end="00:02:36.830" style="s2">kind of projecting everyone onto some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.800" end="00:02:39.110" style="s2">idealized shadowy other and when enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.830" end="00:02:40.310" style="s2">individuals display these symptoms of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.110" end="00:02:44.330" style="s2">course they start to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.310" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">politically - and you know of course the</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.330" end="00:02:48.140" style="s2">the other reality there is that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.490" style="s2">live in this constant low-level state of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.140" end="00:02:52.640" style="s2">threat perception</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.490" end="00:02:55.220" style="s2">I mean Israelis are constantly at some</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.640" end="00:02:57.560" style="s2">level perceiving threats of terrorism or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.220" end="00:02:59.630" style="s2">of rocket attacks or even of invasion</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.560" end="00:03:01.790" style="s2">and then Palestinians are constantly</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.630" end="00:03:03.620" style="s2">perceiving the threat of arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.790" end="00:03:05.570" style="s2">arrests or of their house being the next</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.620" end="00:03:07.190" style="s2">to be demolished or of just living in</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.570" end="00:03:09.500" style="s2">kind of conditions of more or less total</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.190" end="00:03:12.950" style="s2">surveillance so everyone&#39;s triggered all</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.500" end="00:03:14.270" style="s2">of the time and then you know I mean at</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:15.830" style="s2">another level you look at that and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.270" end="00:03:17.660" style="s2">think well I can see how this plays out</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.830" end="00:03:19.700" style="s2">in a kind of conflict zone like this but</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.660" end="00:03:21.530" style="s2">actually is it really is it overreaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.700" end="00:03:24.740" style="s2">a bit to say that this is also relevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.530" end="00:03:27.230" style="s2">to brexit or to trump and of course I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.740" end="00:03:29.090" style="s2">not saying that you know most voters in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.230" end="00:03:31.010" style="s2">Britain or the States are traumatized in</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.090" end="00:03:33.650" style="s2">the SIS trick&#39;d medical sense but the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.010" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">threat perception absolutely shows up</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.650" end="00:03:37.430" style="s2">when you look at opinion polling of why</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:39.530" style="s2">do people vote Trump one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.430" end="00:03:41.570" style="s2">strongest predictors for that was this</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.530" end="00:03:43.970" style="s2">sense that the American Way of life is</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.570" end="00:03:46.730" style="s2">threatened it was the same with leave</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.970" end="00:03:48.620" style="s2">voters in the UK many of whom clear</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.730" end="00:03:50.120" style="s2">majority of whom agreed like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.620" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">Britain increasingly feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.120" end="00:03:52.370" style="s2">foreign country and that makes me feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.050" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.370" end="00:03:55.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s threat perception on that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.050" end="00:03:57.650" style="s2">side and then of course as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.550" end="00:03:59.810" style="s2">you&#39;ve had the presidential election in</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.650" end="00:04:02.330" style="s2">2016 or the brexit referendum all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.810" end="00:04:04.700" style="s2">kind of liberal cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.330" end="00:04:05.930" style="s2">internationalist type people also wake</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.700" end="00:04:07.280" style="s2">up feeling like they&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.930" end="00:04:08.600" style="s2">foreign country and that makes them feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.280" end="00:04:10.700" style="s2">very uncomfortable now you know how it</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.600" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">feels right most and so the threat</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.700" end="00:04:14.209" style="s2">perception is contagious and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:17.030" style="s2">big risk that it becomes a kind of self</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.209" end="00:04:18.650" style="s2">amplifying feedback loop and so one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.030" end="00:04:20.209" style="s2">the questions right at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.650" end="00:04:22.820" style="s2">collective psychology project is well</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.209" end="00:04:25.460" style="s2">how would we reverse the polarity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.820" end="00:04:28.260" style="s2">that feedback loop so instead of you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.460" end="00:04:30.480" style="s2">know these kind of mutually reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.260" end="00:04:32.780" style="s2">threat perceptions across the political</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:35.190" style="s2">spectrum we have a kind of mutual</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">reinforcing process of sort of healing</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.190" end="00:04:39.390" style="s2">and coming back together to a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:41.100" style="s2">empathy for each other and respect for</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.390" end="00:04:43.110" style="s2">each other&#39;s experiences and how we</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.100" end="00:04:46.050" style="s2">reach the values that we&#39;ve got and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.110" end="00:04:48.210" style="s2">on my only concern with that narrative</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.050" end="00:04:50.070" style="s2">is that it can seem almost condescending</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.210" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">because you&#39;re sort of saying and when</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.070" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">we talk about these things when we talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:56.430" style="s2">about trumple we talk about brexit as</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">being only a product of sort of fear it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.430" end="00:05:01.560" style="s2">can sound like more of the liberal elite</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">kind of thinking well we know better</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.560" end="00:05:05.100" style="s2">than you what why you&#39;ve done something</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:07.620" style="s2">how do you avoid that in the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.100" end="00:05:09.060" style="s2">around this kind of conversation well I</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.620" end="00:05:10.470" style="s2">think I mean as I say I think the issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.060" end="00:05:12.870" style="s2">of threat perception is by no means</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.470" end="00:05:14.700" style="s2">confined to one side of the political</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.870" end="00:05:16.020" style="s2">spectrum I think on the contrary it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.700" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">something that&#39;s sort of cropping up</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.020" end="00:05:20.460" style="s2">here there and everywhere but I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:21.720" style="s2">course you know you can look at for</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.460" end="00:05:24.030" style="s2">instance membership to the European</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.720" end="00:05:26.760" style="s2">Union and make a completely trenchant</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.030" end="00:05:29.310" style="s2">critique of the EU on very solid</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.760" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">rational basis that has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.310" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">with threat perception or fear or</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:34.500" style="s2">anything like that and I would as it</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:35.970" style="s2">happens by a lot of that critique myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.500" end="00:05:38.190" style="s2">as much about the EU that needs</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.970" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">reforming but I think when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.190" end="00:05:43.200" style="s2">the state of our political debate and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:45.600" style="s2">how much kind of triggering there is and</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.200" end="00:05:47.250" style="s2">how much just Heat and you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.600" end="00:05:48.900" style="s2">projection there is in the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.250" end="00:05:50.430" style="s2">there&#39;s something deeper going on here</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.900" end="00:05:52.950" style="s2">as well and what would you say that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.430" end="00:05:54.870" style="s2">deepening is is it is it that do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.950" end="00:05:56.550" style="s2">think it&#39;s tied to social media or why</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.870" end="00:05:59.070" style="s2">do you think that the level of threat</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.550" end="00:06:02.010" style="s2">perception is rising as high as it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.070" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">right now so I think I mean when you</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.010" end="00:06:05.730" style="s2">look at drivers of political</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:07.640" style="s2">polarization and I&#39;ve just finished a</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.730" end="00:06:09.870" style="s2">big study on this for any Y you the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.640" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">literature out there tends to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.870" end="00:06:14.760" style="s2">three baskets of issues and one is about</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:16.710" style="s2">the political stuff people feel deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.760" end="00:06:19.650" style="s2">disaffected with political systems with</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.710" end="00:06:21.330" style="s2">elites corruption and so on second you</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.650" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">have a basket of stuff that&#39;s to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.330" end="00:06:25.950" style="s2">economics and partly that&#39;s about social</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.940" end="00:06:28.140" style="s2">mobility and unemployment and inequality</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.950" end="00:06:30.150" style="s2">but especially it seems to me this issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.140" end="00:06:31.950" style="s2">of perceived relative economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.150" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">deprivation that you feel you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.950" end="00:06:36.180" style="s2">less well than other people or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:38.280" style="s2">less well than you used to be doing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.180" end="00:06:39.569" style="s2">then the third basket is all about</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.280" end="00:06:42.330" style="s2">culture and</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.569" end="00:06:43.740" style="s2">values and identity and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.330" end="00:06:45.749" style="s2">issues like immigration which are</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.740" end="00:06:48.389" style="s2">obviously very polarizing sit so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.749" end="00:06:49.949" style="s2">those three baskets but I think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.389" end="00:06:51.629" style="s2">maybe been less well explored is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.949" end="00:06:54.959" style="s2">extent to which each of those three</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.629" end="00:06:57.719" style="s2">baskets has this psychological substrate</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.959" end="00:06:59.369" style="s2">this sort of place where those issues</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.719" end="00:07:01.289" style="s2">out there in the world come in to our</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.369" end="00:07:02.879" style="s2">mental environments and how we perceive</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.289" end="00:07:05.789" style="s2">them and whether we perceive them as</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.879" end="00:07:08.580" style="s2">threatening scary triggering etc and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.789" end="00:07:11.909" style="s2">this is not an area that&#39;s either well</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.580" end="00:07:15.180" style="s2">explored all that we invest much as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.909" end="00:07:18.689" style="s2">society in you know helping us to build</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.180" end="00:07:21.270" style="s2">our capacities on I mean I saw a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.689" end="00:07:22.979" style="s2">the Cambridge analytic a story when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.270" end="00:07:25.229" style="s2">was working at advisin you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.979" end="00:07:28.770" style="s2">it&#39;s such a fascinating lesson and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.229" end="00:07:31.649" style="s2">this data company was essentially able</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.770" end="00:07:33.240" style="s2">to weaponize our own anxieties against</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.649" end="00:07:36.419" style="s2">us to use this combination of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.240" end="00:07:38.759" style="s2">psychological targeting and technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.419" end="00:07:41.039" style="s2">in particular social media micro</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.759" end="00:07:43.789" style="s2">targeting to kind of press our buttons</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.039" end="00:07:46.409" style="s2">with a very high degree of precision and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.789" end="00:07:48.269" style="s2">prompt a critical mass of people to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.409" end="00:07:50.519" style="s2">the world in them anarse terms just when</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.269" end="00:07:53.099" style="s2">it really counted and thereby tipping</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.519" end="00:07:55.619" style="s2">election and my takeaway from that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.099" end="00:07:58.499" style="s2">that it turns out that democracy really</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.619" end="00:08:00.899" style="s2">depends on having a citizenry that has a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.499" end="00:08:02.490" style="s2">capacity to manage its mental and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.899" end="00:08:03.990" style="s2">emotional states but then if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.490" end="00:08:05.819" style="s2">you know is that something we teach in</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.990" end="00:08:08.219" style="s2">schools no not really is that something</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.819" end="00:08:10.050" style="s2">that we put significant resource into in</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.219" end="00:08:13.169" style="s2">the health service no not really we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.050" end="00:08:15.719" style="s2">actually pretty unsure whose job it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.169" end="00:08:17.339" style="s2">to help us navigate those things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.719" end="00:08:19.860" style="s2">are right at the cusp of inner and outer</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.339" end="00:08:21.419" style="s2">and right at the cusp of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.860" end="00:08:22.619" style="s2">and the collective I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.419" end="00:08:24.180" style="s2">probably because historically this has</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.619" end="00:08:26.729" style="s2">been what religions have been in charge</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:28.619" style="s2">of and then as religiosity has declined</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.729" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">and as religion has retreated from</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.619" end="00:08:31.919" style="s2">public life we sort of looked around</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.229" style="s2">thinking well who&#39;s in charge of this</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.919" end="00:08:35.579" style="s2">now and we&#39;re really not sure you talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.229" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">about the need to kind of build that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.579" end="00:08:40.199" style="s2">kind of capacity how do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.939" style="s2">might do that right so actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.199" end="00:08:43.889" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of fascinating work</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.939" end="00:08:45.420" style="s2">already happening out there one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.889" end="00:08:47.459" style="s2">things that the report talks about is</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.420" end="00:08:49.470" style="s2">that there&#39;s these three transitions</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.459" end="00:08:51.899" style="s2">that are really important for us to make</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.470" end="00:08:52.150" style="s2">both individually and collectively and</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.899" end="00:08:53.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.150" end="00:08:55.540" style="s2">first one is from this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.440" end="00:08:57.520" style="s2">fight-or-flight mode through to having</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.540" end="00:09:00.910" style="s2">enough self-awareness to choose how to</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.520" end="00:09:02.920" style="s2">react to situations the second one is to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.910" end="00:09:04.450" style="s2">move from powerlessness which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.920" end="00:09:06.490" style="s2">something that lots of people feel</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.450" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">whether it&#39;s at home or at work or in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.490" end="00:09:11.230" style="s2">their communities or especially in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:12.970" style="s2">politics towards a sense of agency of</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.230" end="00:09:14.950" style="s2">being able to chart their own course in</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.970" end="00:09:17.590" style="s2">life and to help shape the course of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.950" end="00:09:19.360" style="s2">society and then the third one is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.590" end="00:09:21.670" style="s2">transition from disconnection and</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.360" end="00:09:25.240" style="s2">especially loneliness through to a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.670" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">of belonging and you know there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.240" end="00:09:30.280" style="s2">great work happening out there in each</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:33.100" style="s2">of those three fields I mean on building</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.280" end="00:09:34.780" style="s2">self-awareness look at meditation apps</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.100" end="00:09:36.730" style="s2">like Carmel headspace look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.780" end="00:09:38.800" style="s2">organizations like cure violence in</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.730" end="00:09:41.170" style="s2">Chicago who are incredibly good at</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.800" end="00:09:43.180" style="s2">identifying people who are at risk of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.170" end="00:09:45.310" style="s2">getting involved in gang violence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.180" end="00:09:46.780" style="s2">then focusing mental health support on</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.310" end="00:09:49.480" style="s2">them to help them kind of manage their</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.780" end="00:09:51.700" style="s2">states and cool off instead of acting</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.480" end="00:09:53.710" style="s2">out when they&#39;re triggered so these are</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.700" end="00:09:55.930" style="s2">you know great examples this is stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.710" end="00:09:59.020" style="s2">you can teach and stuff you can learn or</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.930" end="00:10:01.090" style="s2">if you&#39;ll want to look at you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.020" end="00:10:03.070" style="s2">building capacity for people to feel a</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.090" end="00:10:04.780" style="s2">sense of agency there&#39;s some great</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.070" end="00:10:06.730" style="s2">trainings out there whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.780" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">trainings to help you have difficult</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.730" end="00:10:11.110" style="s2">conversations or figure out your life</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.400" style="s2">purpose or build a political movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.110" end="00:10:15.760" style="s2">that wants to go and change the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.400" end="00:10:17.650" style="s2">those trainings exist or on belonging I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.760" end="00:10:19.780" style="s2">mean there&#39;s incredible work being done</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.650" end="00:10:21.730" style="s2">by people like the cares family or</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.780" end="00:10:24.520" style="s2">participate or ecity who are both doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.730" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">really great on-the-ground work to build</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.520" end="00:10:29.170" style="s2">social connections in places where</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.730" style="s2">they&#39;ve really afraid so that&#39;s the good</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.170" end="00:10:33.220" style="s2">news that there are these really bright</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.730" end="00:10:35.800" style="s2">spots and that this is stuff that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.220" end="00:10:38.590" style="s2">train and learn and get better at but</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.800" end="00:10:41.500" style="s2">you know the bad news is that overall as</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.590" end="00:10:45.640" style="s2">a society we invest very very little in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.500" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">this stuff and there&#39;s a ton of need so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:49.630" style="s2">you know we&#39;re starting from a low base</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:52.390" style="s2">but we have some sense of you know where</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.630" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">we need to go to and can you talk a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.390" end="00:10:56.590" style="s2">little bit about the journey that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:58.300" style="s2">come to to get to this point because I</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.590" end="00:10:59.560" style="s2">know that you used to work you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.300" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">an advisor for the government for many</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.560" end="00:11:03.610" style="s2">years and what I understand is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:04.930" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of realized that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.610" end="00:11:05.590" style="s2">solutions to these problems needs to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.930" end="00:11:07.000" style="s2">come from a deep</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.590" end="00:11:10.150" style="s2">level than were normally looking for</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.000" end="00:11:12.730" style="s2">right so I spent a long time as a policy</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.150" end="00:11:14.650" style="s2">wonk in various guises I spent most of</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.730" end="00:11:16.930" style="s2">my 20s wishing I was Josh Lyman in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.650" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">West Wing and so I worked as a special</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.930" end="00:11:19.990" style="s2">advisor for two British government</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:21.790" style="s2">ministers worked in the UN Secretary</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.990" end="00:11:24.100" style="s2">General&#39;s Office for lots of think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.790" end="00:11:26.170" style="s2">and my whole kind of theory have changed</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.100" end="00:11:28.150" style="s2">if you like all that time was that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.170" end="00:11:29.770" style="s2">basically get the right evidence you put</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.150" end="00:11:32.670" style="s2">it in front of the right policymakers</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.770" end="00:11:34.960" style="s2">and then things will happen and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.670" end="00:11:37.090" style="s2">started to realize increasingly I</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.960" end="00:11:39.430" style="s2">suppose from about 2011 onwards that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.090" end="00:11:41.500" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t really true there was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.430" end="00:11:43.480" style="s2">particularly disillusioning United</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.500" end="00:11:45.490" style="s2">Nations process that I was part of which</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.480" end="00:11:46.960" style="s2">I went into thinking this is my dream</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.490" end="00:11:49.120" style="s2">job to get evidence in front of</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.960" end="00:11:52.270" style="s2">policymakers and it was very dispiriting</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.120" end="00:11:54.220" style="s2">and that sent me on this journey of</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.270" end="00:11:56.440" style="s2">wondering well you know if evidence and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.220" end="00:12:00.430" style="s2">data and arguments don&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.440" end="00:12:02.920" style="s2">world and what does and the first kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.430" end="00:12:04.930" style="s2">of big part of that story was that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.920" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">storytelling that really changes the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.930" end="00:12:08.110" style="s2">world and that&#39;s something that I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:11.140" style="s2">about in a book called the myth gap</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:12.940" style="s2">which came out in 2017 and the book was</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.140" end="00:12:14.650" style="s2">published just after the brexit</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.940" end="00:12:16.450" style="s2">referendum and just after Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.650" end="00:12:18.850" style="s2">victory and of course when you looked at</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.450" end="00:12:20.200" style="s2">people like Trump or Nigel Faraj you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.850" end="00:12:22.180" style="s2">know these clearly weren&#39;t people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.200" end="00:12:25.060" style="s2">cry and because of the quality of their</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.180" end="00:12:27.220" style="s2">evidence base they were just incredible</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.060" end="00:12:29.380" style="s2">storytellers with particularly this</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:31.630" style="s2">knack for tapping into people&#39;s fears</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.380" end="00:12:34.630" style="s2">and kind of activating and amplifying</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.630" end="00:12:36.700" style="s2">those fears and so what the myth gap was</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.630" end="00:12:39.160" style="s2">really about was a sense of that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.700" end="00:12:41.500" style="s2">know people on the authoritarian</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.160" end="00:12:44.500" style="s2">populist right are very good at telling</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.500" end="00:12:47.350" style="s2">these deep stories that particularly tap</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.500" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">into the modern absence of myth these</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.350" end="00:12:51.970" style="s2">kind of shared stories that talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:55.000" style="s2">where we are and how we got here and who</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.970" end="00:12:56.620" style="s2">we are and so at the time I wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.000" end="00:12:58.360" style="s2">myth gap I thought well this is straight</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.620" end="00:13:00.220" style="s2">forward progressive people you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.360" end="00:13:01.750" style="s2">liberals and activists and campaigners</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.220" end="00:13:03.370" style="s2">need to be just as good at storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.750" end="00:13:06.400" style="s2">and then will take on the populist and</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.370" end="00:13:09.220" style="s2">will win but since then I&#39;ve become much</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.400" end="00:13:12.640" style="s2">more interested in just popular sorry</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.220" end="00:13:14.980" style="s2">polarization itself is the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.640" end="00:13:16.810" style="s2">you know actually if all we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.980" end="00:13:18.580" style="s2">creating more weapons for progressives</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.810" end="00:13:19.190" style="s2">to fight conservatives with we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.580" end="00:13:21.860" style="s2">deep in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.190" end="00:13:24.020" style="s2">this rift in our politics and actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.860" end="00:13:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that we have to heal if</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.020" end="00:13:28.850" style="s2">we want to move forward from where we</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:32.060" style="s2">are now are you familiar with polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.850" end="00:13:34.340" style="s2">theory and the idea so we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.060" end="00:13:36.290" style="s2">interview with Peter Levine recently who</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.340" end="00:13:37.400" style="s2">work very closely with Steven Porges who</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.290" end="00:13:40.460" style="s2">came up with the idea of polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.400" end="00:13:43.340" style="s2">theory and we&#39;re also very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.460" end="00:13:44.960" style="s2">this sort of more trauma based work from</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.340" end="00:13:49.490" style="s2">our retreats and the personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.960" end="00:13:52.280" style="s2">stuff and my sense is that this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.490" end="00:13:54.260" style="s2">understanding about threat perception</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.280" end="00:13:56.090" style="s2">about how we orient ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.260" end="00:13:58.460" style="s2">particularly what I think polyvagal</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.090" end="00:14:00.430" style="s2">theory is really important is saying we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.460" end="00:14:02.390" style="s2">can either be in an exploratory</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.430" end="00:14:04.250" style="s2">framework where we can accept new</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.390" end="00:14:06.710" style="s2">information and we can make contact with</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.250" end="00:14:08.260" style="s2">people or in a defensive framework and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.710" end="00:14:10.220" style="s2">when we&#39;re in those defensive framework</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.260" end="00:14:10.760" style="s2">everything that&#39;s coming in feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.220" end="00:14:13.010" style="s2">threat</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.760" end="00:14:14.450" style="s2">right so I&#39;m no kind of expert in</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.010" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">polyvagal theory but I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.450" end="00:14:18.980" style="s2">absolutely fascinating avenue of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:20.450" style="s2">and it makes sense to me and as more</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.980" end="00:14:22.850" style="s2">generally does the work of people like</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.450" end="00:14:24.410" style="s2">Peter Levine and identifying that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.850" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">know trauma is not just something that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.410" end="00:14:28.370" style="s2">lives in our heads that it has a</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:32.630" style="s2">physiological reality it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.370" end="00:14:34.640" style="s2">embedded and stored in the body so I</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.630" end="00:14:36.860" style="s2">think you know this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.640" end="00:14:38.930" style="s2">strands that can really help us to</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.860" end="00:14:40.850" style="s2">become better at managing our states to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.930" end="00:14:42.950" style="s2">kind of know when we&#39;re triggered into</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.850" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">fight-or-flight mode and take the time</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.950" end="00:14:48.800" style="s2">to step back and trigger you know move</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:51.430" style="s2">back into a more reflective conscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.800" end="00:14:54.860" style="s2">frame of mind and again you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.430" end="00:14:57.770" style="s2">absolutely critical stuff for 21st</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.860" end="00:14:59.300" style="s2">century citizens to be able to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.770" end="00:15:01.910" style="s2">really matters for the health of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.300" end="00:15:03.470" style="s2">politics and you worked within the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.910" end="00:15:06.200" style="s2">political machine so you&#39;ve got kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.470" end="00:15:09.130" style="s2">an idea about where like how out there</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.200" end="00:15:10.700" style="s2">is this kind of talk this kind of work</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.130" end="00:15:14.210" style="s2">compared to where the political</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.700" end="00:15:15.260" style="s2">conversation is now and how much hope do</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.210" end="00:15:17.570" style="s2">you have because there is this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.260" end="00:15:19.130" style="s2">sense at least in the UK of ever</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.570" end="00:15:21.320" style="s2">decreasing circles I mean everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.130" end="00:15:23.110" style="s2">running out of ideas and run it it just</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.320" end="00:15:26.180" style="s2">feels like politics is running down</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.110" end="00:15:28.070" style="s2">rapidly yeah what&#39;s the distance between</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.180" end="00:15:29.450" style="s2">sort of the political machine and this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.070" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">kind of conversation so I certainly</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.450" end="00:15:32.870" style="s2">don&#39;t think mainstream political</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:33.620" style="s2">discourse is here yet I mean one of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.870" end="00:15:35.090" style="s2">ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.620" end="00:15:36.980" style="s2">at the heart of the report that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.090" end="00:15:39.890" style="s2">just produced is the idea that the inner</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.980" end="00:15:42.140" style="s2">and outer crises that we see in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.890" end="00:15:42.890" style="s2">world and inside us are two sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.140" end="00:15:44.390" style="s2">same coin</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.890" end="00:15:46.700" style="s2">so on the one hand you have this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.390" end="00:15:48.290" style="s2">pile of crises out there in the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.700" end="00:15:50.930" style="s2">like climate breakdown and hyper</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.290" end="00:15:52.850" style="s2">inequality and mass extinction and so on</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.930" end="00:15:55.850" style="s2">and then over here you&#39;ve got this pile</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.850" end="00:15:58.280" style="s2">of mental health crises like suicide and</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.850" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">self-harm and anxiety and depression and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.280" end="00:16:04.430" style="s2">addiction and so on and so on and what</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:06.650" style="s2">I&#39;m arguing in the report is that at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.430" end="00:16:10.030" style="s2">moment you know these two sets of crises</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.650" end="00:16:13.130" style="s2">are fueling each other we feel messed up</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.030" end="00:16:15.110" style="s2">inside partly because we feel like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.130" end="00:16:16.760" style="s2">world is messed up out there and when we</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.110" end="00:16:19.460" style="s2">feel messed up inside when we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.760" end="00:16:20.990" style="s2">triggered we act out in ways that worsen</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.460" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">the state of the world so again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.990" end="00:16:26.330" style="s2">another example of a feedback loop now</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:28.520" style="s2">you look at mainstream politics as it is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.330" end="00:16:30.890" style="s2">today or for that matter the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.520" end="00:16:34.400" style="s2">campaigning that you get from big global</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.890" end="00:16:36.620" style="s2">NGOs it only talks about the outer stuff</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.400" end="00:16:39.710" style="s2">it&#39;s all about you know issues in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.620" end="00:16:42.320" style="s2">world of out there and it&#39;s just silent</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.710" end="00:16:44.150" style="s2">on the question of the states of mind of</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.320" end="00:16:45.800" style="s2">the citizens who are voting or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.150" end="00:16:47.030" style="s2">policymakers who are making the decision</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.800" end="00:16:50.330" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of you know they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.030" end="00:16:52.670" style="s2">completely separate now the good news is</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.330" end="00:16:54.800" style="s2">that I think certainly politics is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.670" end="00:16:57.620" style="s2">paying much more attention to mental</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.800" end="00:17:00.320" style="s2">health issues so loneliness now has a</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.620" end="00:17:03.650" style="s2">dedicated Minister in the UK for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.320" end="00:17:05.240" style="s2">and you know mindfulness now has an</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.650" end="00:17:07.750" style="s2">all-party group in the British</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.240" end="00:17:09.830" style="s2">Parliament there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.750" end="00:17:11.090" style="s2">policymakers who meditate so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.830" end="00:17:13.490" style="s2">this you know just like the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.090" end="00:17:16.100" style="s2">society people who work in politics have</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.490" end="00:17:18.890" style="s2">been increasingly realizing that yes</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.100" end="00:17:21.500" style="s2">mental health matters but what we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.890" end="00:17:23.240" style="s2">seeing is that synthesis of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.500" end="00:17:26.180" style="s2">that you know our mental health our</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.240" end="00:17:30.320" style="s2">state of mind matter for the state of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.180" end="00:17:32.930" style="s2">the world and vice versa but I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.320" end="00:17:34.550" style="s2">that&#39;s partly because this isn&#39;t an idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.930" end="00:17:36.800" style="s2">that&#39;s really surfaced much until</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.550" end="00:17:38.300" style="s2">recently and now it feels like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.800" end="00:17:39.890" style="s2">people are converging on to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.300" end="00:17:41.570" style="s2">territory I mean I don&#39;t feel at all</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.890" end="00:17:43.040" style="s2">like the collective psychology projects</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.570" end="00:17:45.320" style="s2">the only player in this space I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.040" end="00:17:46.760" style="s2">ton of people are sort of converging on</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.320" end="00:17:49.220" style="s2">this space which gives me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.760" end="00:17:51.740" style="s2">hope that feels like this is something</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.220" end="00:17:53.300" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of right that&#39;s ready to you</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.740" end="00:17:56.450" style="s2">know mature and take root in the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.300" end="00:17:58.760" style="s2">and I think therefore like you know I</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.450" end="00:18:00.920" style="s2">don&#39;t see this as like expecting massive</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.760" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">pushback from people who work in</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.920" end="00:18:03.710" style="s2">politics on this stuff I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:05.330" style="s2">just a question that we have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.710" end="00:18:07.010" style="s2">out how to start seeding it so it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.330" end="00:18:09.050" style="s2">take root and sprout and do you sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.010" end="00:18:10.430" style="s2">the right place to start it&#39;s politics</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.050" end="00:18:13.400" style="s2">because I&#39;ve I&#39;ve kind of had this</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.430" end="00:18:14.660" style="s2">thought as well with we we run personal</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.400" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">growth retrieves we&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.660" end="00:18:17.600" style="s2">interested in bringing that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:20.270" style="s2">deeper dimension into what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.600" end="00:18:22.190" style="s2">and my sense is that the only way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.270" end="00:18:24.110" style="s2">change it really is to start with</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.190" end="00:18:26.180" style="s2">culture is to change the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.110" end="00:18:28.010" style="s2">narrative around psychology around</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.180" end="00:18:30.290" style="s2">personal growth around therapy around</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.010" end="00:18:32.420" style="s2">all these topics because politics will</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.290" end="00:18:33.590" style="s2">always play catch-up to to culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.420" end="00:18:36.130" style="s2">rather than the other way around</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.590" end="00:18:38.150" style="s2">like it&#39;s very I I can&#39;t really imagine</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.130" end="00:18:39.500" style="s2">presenting something to a minister and</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.150" end="00:18:41.240" style="s2">getting them to buy into it it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:43.310" style="s2">seems that it has to come from from</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.240" end="00:18:44.030" style="s2">culture more right I&#39;m very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.310" end="00:18:46.370" style="s2">same place as you</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.030" end="00:18:48.530" style="s2">I mean I think if if you took this idea</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.370" end="00:18:51.230" style="s2">which is all about kind of our state of</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.530" end="00:18:53.000" style="s2">consciousness and how that creates the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.230" end="00:18:55.010" style="s2">conditions for things to arise</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.000" end="00:18:57.110" style="s2">politically whether that&#39;s good things</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.010" end="00:18:59.630" style="s2">or really bad things which is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.110" end="00:19:02.330" style="s2">seeing a lot of at the moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.630" end="00:19:05.750" style="s2">that&#39;s a very distributed grassroots II</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.330" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">collective sort of proposition and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.750" end="00:19:09.260" style="s2">know it&#39;s not this kind of little</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:11.240" style="s2">bite-sized thing that you can make into</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.260" end="00:19:14.210" style="s2">a lobbying ask on politicians or that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.240" end="00:19:15.440" style="s2">kind of thing but I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.210" end="00:19:17.240" style="s2">also a question there of what do we mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.440" end="00:19:19.430" style="s2">by politics if we just mean what happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:21.050" style="s2">inside the Westminster village then yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.430" end="00:19:23.660" style="s2">this stuff is you know at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.050" end="00:19:26.090" style="s2">quite far from that even if we interpret</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.660" end="00:19:28.010" style="s2">politics as meaning kind of activism I</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.090" end="00:19:30.110" style="s2">mean again it&#39;s like a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.010" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">subset of people in the population who</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.110" end="00:19:33.800" style="s2">would see themselves as activists and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:35.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a much bigger group of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.800" end="00:19:37.640" style="s2">who see activists is like a different</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.840" end="00:19:40.120" style="s2">sort of person to me so you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.640" end="00:19:42.140" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of troublemakers and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.120" end="00:19:43.880" style="s2">part of our problem I think is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.140" end="00:19:45.710" style="s2">we&#39;ve regarded politics is something to</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.880" end="00:19:47.510" style="s2">be delegated to politicians or to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.710" end="00:19:49.010" style="s2">activists but not something that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.510" end="00:19:50.870" style="s2">know we as ordinary people to ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.010" end="00:19:52.880" style="s2">whereas actually you know that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.870" end="00:19:55.250" style="s2">course what the idea of citizenship is</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.880" end="00:19:56.419" style="s2">all about and that&#39;s why I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.250" end="00:19:58.850" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.419" end="00:20:01.609" style="s2">you know the idea of what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.850" end="00:20:04.809" style="s2">21st century citizenship what skills</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.609" end="00:20:07.580" style="s2">does the 21st century citizen need and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.809" end="00:20:09.889" style="s2">you know in particular what state</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.580" end="00:20:11.989" style="s2">management capacity is what in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.889" end="00:20:14.119" style="s2">of agency and belonging does that</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.989" end="00:20:17.299" style="s2">citizen rely on in a in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.119" end="00:20:19.100" style="s2">to do politics healthily constructively</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.299" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">you know in a way that builds futures</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.100" end="00:20:23.899" style="s2">that we actually want you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:25.820" style="s2">the that there&#39;s a gap in society where</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.899" end="00:20:27.769" style="s2">religion used to be and I remember I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.820" end="00:20:29.090" style="s2">read the myth gap when you brought it</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.769" end="00:20:32.299" style="s2">out a couple of years ago and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.090" end="00:20:34.749" style="s2">that was really a really really good way</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.299" end="00:20:37.039" style="s2">of looking at okay what are the deep</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.749" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">what is the deep mythos that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.039" end="00:20:43.279" style="s2">missing what is the gap that religion</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">filled that we need to re yeah hi so</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.279" end="00:20:46.190" style="s2">it&#39;s a really interesting one I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.289" style="s2">there are lots of facets to the gap I</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.190" end="00:20:50.929" style="s2">mean as you say the myth gap was very</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.289" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">much about the kind of deep collective</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.929" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">stories that religion used to provide</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:58.399" style="s2">when still of course does provide but</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.090" end="00:21:00.200" style="s2">you know not to the same extent not in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.399" end="00:21:01.970" style="s2">the sense of being universally shared</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.200" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">reference points in the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.970" end="00:21:07.489" style="s2">would once have been in individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:09.679" style="s2">societies so the story aspect is part of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.489" end="00:21:12.259" style="s2">it I think in the collective psychology</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.679" end="00:21:14.059" style="s2">project it&#39;s a little less about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.259" end="00:21:16.249" style="s2">stories and a bit more about if you like</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.059" end="00:21:18.230" style="s2">the social services that religions are</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.249" end="00:21:20.269" style="s2">historically provided so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.230" end="00:21:22.489" style="s2">when you look at kind of putting tools</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.269" end="00:21:25.309" style="s2">for building self-awareness out into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.489" end="00:21:26.859" style="s2">world at their best what religions have</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.309" end="00:21:28.970" style="s2">done is offered things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.859" end="00:21:31.159" style="s2">meditation and prayer which are very</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.970" end="00:21:33.859" style="s2">effective tried and tested tools for</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.159" end="00:21:35.629" style="s2">managing your emotional state or if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.859" end="00:21:37.759" style="s2">look at the question of how religions</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.629" end="00:21:41.830" style="s2">have helped people to build agency I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.759" end="00:21:43.759" style="s2">mean until the mid 1960s so many big</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.830" end="00:21:45.499" style="s2">transformational political movements</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.759" end="00:21:48.440" style="s2">were rooted in communities of faith</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.499" end="00:21:51.109" style="s2">whether that the abolition of slavery or</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.440" end="00:21:56.450" style="s2">the American civil rights struggle in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.109" end="00:21:59.899" style="s2">the 50s and 60s you know or remember the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.450" end="00:22:01.999" style="s2">other example labor</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.899" end="00:22:03.320" style="s2">well the labor party is another one but</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.999" end="00:22:04.249" style="s2">there&#39;s another particular example that</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.320" end="00:22:05.929" style="s2">I can&#39;t remember Oh</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.249" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">women&#39;s suffrage no cancellation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.929" end="00:22:11.080" style="s2">third-world debt actually in</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:14.800" style="s2">in the 1990s and the early 2000s again</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.080" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">very much rooted in faith communities so</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.800" end="00:22:18.820" style="s2">again at their best religions have</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:21.250" style="s2">really performed this role of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.820" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">putting tools for agency out there into</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.250" end="00:22:25.300" style="s2">the world and in terms of belonging of</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:27.760" style="s2">course religions have been all about</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.300" end="00:22:29.680" style="s2">creating congregational spaces where</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.760" end="00:22:31.720" style="s2">people feel like they can belong in</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.680" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">spite of their differences in spite of</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.720" end="00:22:38.530" style="s2">their shortcomings so that&#39;s if you like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:40.030" style="s2">a separate set of things that religions</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.530" end="00:22:42.730" style="s2">have historically done for us but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.030" end="00:22:44.410" style="s2">know as with myth it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.730" end="00:22:46.180" style="s2">turns out to be incredibly important for</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.410" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">our collective psychological health and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.180" end="00:22:50.740" style="s2">now we&#39;re looking around for you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:52.420" style="s2">how to fill that gap so I think in a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.740" end="00:22:54.370" style="s2">the myth gap was sort of you know just</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.420" end="00:22:57.160" style="s2">the beginning the thin end of the wedge</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.370" end="00:22:59.860" style="s2">in this exploration of what what we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.160" end="00:23:02.560" style="s2">lost as religion has receded from public</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.860" end="00:23:05.050" style="s2">life and from our own lives but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.560" end="00:23:06.610" style="s2">mean that to imply that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.050" end="00:23:08.140" style="s2">myth gap was an argument that we should</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.610" end="00:23:10.510" style="s2">all go back to church anymore than the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.140" end="00:23:12.220" style="s2">collective psychology project is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.510" end="00:23:15.550" style="s2">argument to say we need religion back</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.220" end="00:23:17.620" style="s2">because there are real reasons and often</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.550" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">very good reasons why religious</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.620" end="00:23:22.870" style="s2">observance has declined I mean people</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:24.940" style="s2">are rightly ready to point to many of</p>

<p begin="00:25:08.750" end="00:25:14.120" style="s2">recognizing oh wow actually this is what</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.419" end="00:25:15.590" style="s2">we provoked this and that seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.120" end="00:25:17.090" style="s2">really important part of this collective</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.900" end="00:25:33.440" style="s2">frustrating to watch because on the one</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.910" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">hand it was supposed to be this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.440" end="00:25:38.000" style="s2">you know standard bearer for the remain</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:39.919" style="s2">cause but on the other hand there was</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.000" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">just no acknowledgement of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.919" end="00:25:43.790" style="s2">real-world grievances and in justices</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:46.280" style="s2">that helped create the political</p>

<p begin="00:25:46.280" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">and there was no display of listening</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.090" end="00:25:55.429" style="s2">and one of the interesting things I have</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:57.020" style="s2">been exploring in work I&#39;ve done for New</p>

<p begin="00:26:08.809" end="00:26:14.990" style="s2">political polarization and there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.990" end="00:26:18.980" style="s2">countries about the kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:21.590" style="s2">can rebuild common ground and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.980" end="00:26:24.559" style="s2">things like apologies and making a real</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.590" end="00:26:25.520" style="s2">show of listening and you know often</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.559" end="00:26:27.140" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.520" end="00:26:30.200" style="s2">populist obviously understand very well</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.140" end="00:26:32.390" style="s2">that the performative dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">politics really matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.390" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">symbolic and the imagery and the stories</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.710" style="s2">and again you know progressives are</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.220" end="00:26:41.240" style="s2">often bad at this because they you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.710" end="00:26:43.370" style="s2">just think well we&#39;ve got the answer in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.240" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">terms of data and that&#39;s all you need I</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.370" end="00:26:47.120" style="s2">mean look at climate activists ten years</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:48.230" style="s2">ago they just thought well we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.120" end="00:26:50.060" style="s2">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.230" end="00:26:52.100" style="s2">Change it says we&#39;re right you know what</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.060" end="00:26:53.870" style="s2">else is there to say and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.100" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">the tea party came and ran rings around</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.870" end="00:26:59.210" style="s2">them in terms of storytelling and you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:01.330" style="s2">know that led to losing basically ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.210" end="00:27:03.410" style="s2">years of progress on climate change</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.330" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">until they sort of realized they need to</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.410" end="00:27:08.390" style="s2">come back with a moral story about</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:09.650" style="s2">responsibility for the future then that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.390" end="00:27:11.060" style="s2">was what unlocked the Paris climate</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.650" end="00:27:13.310" style="s2">summit so there are examples of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.060" end="00:27:16.970" style="s2">progressives learning this lesson the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.310" end="00:27:20.300" style="s2">hard way but when you look at brexit and</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.970" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s immensely frustrating to</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.300" end="00:27:24.410" style="s2">see how little learning has been about</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:27.280" style="s2">you know the grievances this came from</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.410" end="00:27:29.900" style="s2">the necessity of listening a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.280" end="00:27:33.680" style="s2">requirement for acknowledgement of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.900" end="00:27:35.000" style="s2">harm that&#39;s been done you know to kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.680" end="00:27:37.220" style="s2">of communities that have been forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:39.350" style="s2">about and left behind and disrespect it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.220" end="00:27:40.820" style="s2">exactly as you say mm-hmm yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.350" end="00:27:41.960" style="s2">this is I mean I&#39;m asked the question</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.820" end="00:27:45.230" style="s2">like this earlier in the interview but</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.960" end="00:27:46.940" style="s2">this is also my sense my concern about</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.230" end="00:27:50.300" style="s2">these conversations when I hear them</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.940" end="00:27:52.310" style="s2">taking place among people looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.300" end="00:27:54.500" style="s2">kind of collective psychology side of it</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.310" end="00:27:56.900" style="s2">or the the psychological side what it</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.500" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">what it can drift into sometimes this</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.900" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">sense of that we understand we we the</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:09.350" style="s2">liberal classes understand what went on</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:10.550" style="s2">yes it was a protest and yes we</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.350" end="00:28:13.000" style="s2">acknowledge it and then we can kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.550" end="00:28:14.900" style="s2">move on to to but without a real</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.000" end="00:28:17.390" style="s2">acknowledgement of okay what was it</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.900" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">about our attitudes to more traditional</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.390" end="00:28:21.850" style="s2">communities for example that provoked</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:24.770" style="s2">the response that that came and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.850" end="00:28:26.420" style="s2">personally I understand why brexit and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.770" end="00:28:27.800" style="s2">Trump happened and in a way I can see it</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.420" end="00:28:30.440" style="s2">as a positive thing because it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.800" end="00:28:32.930" style="s2">the it&#39;s it&#39;s okay your society cannot</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.440" end="00:28:34.670" style="s2">become too fragmented and to pull the</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.930" end="00:28:36.560" style="s2">part without some kind of healing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.670" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">needs to take place right and I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.560" end="00:28:39.050" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:41.570" style="s2">about polarization the political</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.050" end="00:28:44.270" style="s2">polarization is not necessarily bad it</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.570" end="00:28:45.670" style="s2">can play this role of shining a light on</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.270" end="00:28:48.010" style="s2">injustice is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.670" end="00:28:49.900" style="s2">gone ignored for too long but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.010" end="00:28:52.270" style="s2">helpful if it you know it&#39;s that shining</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.900" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">of a light then leads to a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.270" end="00:28:56.620" style="s2">process of right let&#39;s now deal with</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.330" style="s2">these in justices and grievances that</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.620" end="00:29:00.010" style="s2">have been brought to light if that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.330" end="00:29:01.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen of course the risk is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.010" end="00:29:03.700" style="s2">pain of the American white working-class</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.420" end="00:29:06.430" style="s2">the industrialization and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.700" end="00:29:08.980" style="s2">sort of things right so and there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.430" end="00:29:10.630" style="s2">know profound pain and trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.980" end="00:29:14.920" style="s2">heartbreak on both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.630" end="00:29:17.860" style="s2">political spectrum and it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.920" end="00:29:21.700" style="s2">attend to those wounds they need sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.860" end="00:29:23.830" style="s2">to be you know erred if you like so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.700" end="00:29:27.790" style="s2">I I agree with all of that I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.830" end="00:29:28.930" style="s2">I mean I I think in the risk with</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.480" style="s2">transitions and this isn&#39;t just agency</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.740" end="00:29:58.510" style="s2">in the sense of having agency over your</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.480" end="00:30:00.850" style="s2">own life this is very much about yeah we</p>

<p begin="00:30:11.980" end="00:30:15.490" style="s2">think it&#39;s that you know if you think</p>

<p begin="00:30:15.490" end="00:30:22.750" style="s2">inner and outer and that you know the</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.750" end="00:30:25.570" style="s2">can&#39;t possibly solve it by only</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.190" end="00:30:26.980" style="s2">attending to the inner it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:30:26.980" end="00:30:31.150" style="s2">feedback loops and that attending to the</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:33.340" style="s2">inner can help to unlock change in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.150" end="00:30:35.890" style="s2">outer as well where do you think the</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:47.560" style="s2">I mean I think of course there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.690" end="00:30:50.440" style="s2">of politicians and people in the media</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.560" end="00:30:52.300" style="s2">doing very well out of polarization and</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.760" end="00:31:06.530" style="s2">the extremes I mean my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.830" end="00:31:08.990" style="s2">illustration of this is how I sama bin</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.530" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">Laden once observed at the time when the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.990" end="00:31:13.669" style="s2">Iraq war was at its height that it seems</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.799" style="s2">as if al Qaeda and the White House are</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.669" end="00:31:17.450" style="s2">on the same team shooting at the United</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.799" end="00:31:19.250" style="s2">States own goal because you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.450" end="00:31:22.250" style="s2">American policy in Iraq played so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.250" end="00:31:23.600" style="s2">perfectly into our Qaeda&#39;s objectives</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.250" end="00:31:25.700" style="s2">despite the fact that it was being</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.600" end="00:31:28.010" style="s2">driven by the kind of most extreme most</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.700" end="00:31:30.530" style="s2">polarized people within the Republican</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.010" end="00:31:32.600" style="s2">establishment in Washington and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.530" end="00:31:34.340" style="s2">course that&#39;s exactly in a terrorism is</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.600" end="00:31:37.669" style="s2">the object lesson in this it&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.340" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">to trigger a fear-based response that</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.669" end="00:31:42.409" style="s2">then widens the divide and increases</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:44.900" style="s2">recruitment by extremists at both ends</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.409" end="00:31:46.250" style="s2">of the spectrum and you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.900" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">straight back into that game of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.250" end="00:31:51.980" style="s2">feedback loops and the sort of Center</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:54.230" style="s2">unraveling and so yeah people who are</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.980" end="00:31:57.140" style="s2">doing well out of polarization often for</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.230" end="00:31:59.539" style="s2">extremely cynical reasons will be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.140" end="00:32:02.059" style="s2">first to come out and you know take</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.539" end="00:32:05.000" style="s2">potshots at this or anything else but</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.059" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">seeking to rebuild common ground but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.000" end="00:32:08.450" style="s2">truth is that the scale of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:10.789" style="s2">challenges that we face whether that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.450" end="00:32:13.640" style="s2">climate breakdown or mass extinction or</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.789" end="00:32:16.130" style="s2">the economic injustice is that building</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.640" end="00:32:19.309" style="s2">up in the world around us these issues</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.130" end="00:32:21.140" style="s2">are way too big to be dealt with by one</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.309" end="00:32:22.820" style="s2">side beating the other side you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.140" end="00:32:24.950" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna solve climate change with a</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.820" end="00:32:26.809" style="s2">sense of common purpose that&#39;s shared</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.950" end="00:32:29.240" style="s2">across the whole of society so we do</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.809" end="00:32:30.559" style="s2">really depend on rebuilding common</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.240" end="00:32:32.780" style="s2">ground in order to kind of navigate</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.559" end="00:32:35.539" style="s2">these global crises confronting us at</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.780" end="00:32:36.980" style="s2">this point so where do you hope what do</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.539" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">you hope the report will achieve and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.980" end="00:32:41.480" style="s2">where do you think we need to go next or</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:43.730" style="s2">where do you hope we go next right so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.480" end="00:32:46.669" style="s2">think in the most immediate term I hope</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.730" end="00:32:48.890" style="s2">that the report will Kindle a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.669" end="00:32:52.280" style="s2">community in asking these questions</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.890" end="00:32:53.990" style="s2">because as I said earlier these are not</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.280" end="00:32:56.750" style="s2">areas that are going to be solved for us</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.990" end="00:32:58.970" style="s2">by expert practitioners so it matters</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.750" end="00:33:01.580" style="s2">that we create more spaces where all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.970" end="00:33:03.950" style="s2">us can hold these questions and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.580" end="00:33:04.890" style="s2">definitely hope to be part of catalyzing</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.950" end="00:33:07.290" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.890" end="00:33:09.600" style="s2">I think there&#39;s also a big set of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.290" end="00:33:12.690" style="s2">questions about mapping out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.600" end="00:33:15.210" style="s2">already out there in terms of resources</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.690" end="00:33:17.520" style="s2">to help us build our collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.210" end="00:33:19.200" style="s2">psychological capacities and also to</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.520" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s already out there that</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.200" end="00:33:23.910" style="s2">is harmful because you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:26.220" style="s2">failing the first do no harm test in so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.910" end="00:33:27.960" style="s2">many contexts and so many ways so as</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.220" end="00:33:29.070" style="s2">well as building community one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.960" end="00:33:31.860" style="s2">things we want to focus on at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.070" end="00:33:35.220" style="s2">project is some mapping projects looking</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:37.799" style="s2">at sectors like the UK campaigning</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.220" end="00:33:39.330" style="s2">sector for example or places like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.799" end="00:33:41.700" style="s2">interested in running collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.330" end="00:33:43.790" style="s2">psychology maps in Leeds and in Bristol</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.700" end="00:33:46.080" style="s2">but to do these very participative</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.790" end="00:33:49.169" style="s2">processes where we&#39;re engaging more</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.080" end="00:33:50.880" style="s2">people and sort of observing what in</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.169" end="00:33:52.770" style="s2">their space in their city or their</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:54.929" style="s2">sector is working what&#39;s not working</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.770" end="00:33:56.549" style="s2">where are there gaps where are there</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.929" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">synergies where are the things that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.549" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">could you know do with just a small</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:03.210" style="s2">tweak to their existing model that</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:05.400" style="s2">aren&#39;t being done at the moment so the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.210" end="00:34:07.350" style="s2">mapping work is a big focus for the next</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.400" end="00:34:09.629" style="s2">six months but then beyond that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.350" end="00:34:12.119" style="s2">really interested in what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.629" end="00:34:14.040" style="s2">infrastructure we need to start making</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.119" end="00:34:16.350" style="s2">small bets in this sector because this</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.040" end="00:34:19.050" style="s2">is this is really embryonic work we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.350" end="00:34:20.310" style="s2">no idea what&#39;s actually gonna fly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.050" end="00:34:22.500" style="s2">are going to be the interventions that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.310" end="00:34:24.899" style="s2">can really have a transformational</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.500" end="00:34:26.609" style="s2">impact and go to scale and we&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.899" end="00:34:28.470" style="s2">point therefore where you know if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.609" end="00:34:30.659" style="s2">make ten little bets nine of them are</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.470" end="00:34:32.909" style="s2">gonna fail and then maybe that last</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.659" end="00:34:36.510" style="s2">tenth bet has the potential to win big</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.909" end="00:34:37.950" style="s2">so although we have a couple of small</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.510" end="00:34:39.389" style="s2">bets at the collective psychology</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.950" end="00:34:41.810" style="s2">project we&#39;d like to make I think the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.389" end="00:34:45.300" style="s2">larger question is how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.810" end="00:34:47.220" style="s2">systems and platforms for lots of little</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.300" end="00:34:49.320" style="s2">experiments many of them very</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.220" end="00:34:51.600" style="s2">small-scale or very local and for making</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.320" end="00:34:53.790" style="s2">sure we share the learning from those</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.600" end="00:34:55.590" style="s2">experiments among a kind of involving</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.790" end="00:34:57.090" style="s2">community of people who feel like they</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.590" end="00:34:59.700" style="s2">are practitioners of collective</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.090" end="00:35:01.380" style="s2">psychology so that when we fail we do it</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.700" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">quickly and we make sure that as many</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:05.609" style="s2">people as possible have access to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:09.030" style="s2">lessons from that failure and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.609" end="00:35:10.260" style="s2">know we can iterate quickly and start to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.030" end="00:35:11.880" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s going to work in this</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.260" end="00:35:13.050" style="s2">space but you know we&#39;re starting from a</p>
