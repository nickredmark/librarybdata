<p begin="00:01:00.079" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">uh the the type of things i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.079" end="00:01:06.640" style="s2">for as far as</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.960" style="s2">help are people</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.640" end="00:01:09.920" style="s2">like if there are two people that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.960" end="00:01:12.560" style="s2">willing to have a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.920" end="00:01:15.280" style="s2">debate or a discu you know trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.560" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">come to agreement on a contentious issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.280" end="00:01:19.280" style="s2">that they&#39;d be willing to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:22.000" style="s2">gullible process</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.280" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">that would be helpful to me and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.000" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">also if anyone has any</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">things where they&#39;re trying to convince</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.119" style="s2">the world that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:31.680" style="s2">the world should believe x or something</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.119" end="00:01:33.759" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.680" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">then that might be something where we</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.759" end="00:01:37.600" style="s2">could go through although it&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:39.920" style="s2">also if they have someone that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.600" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">kind of doesn&#39;t think that that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.920" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:45.360" style="s2">uh then you know we could use the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:48.720" style="s2">process on that as well</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.360" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">so those are some ideas and then anyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.720" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">kind of play around with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:59.759" style="s2">all right i can go next then my brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">will be like yep we went from</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.759" end="00:02:04.240" style="s2">left to right so anyway uh my projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">are solution raising which is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.240" end="00:02:07.920" style="s2">hour-long conversation where we generate</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">adjacent possible solutions that we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.920" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">implement now if we had a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:11.360" style="s2">thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">sorry ten thousand people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.360" end="00:02:15.040" style="s2">thousand dollars and we held one this</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">last week i didn&#39;t even pick the topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.040" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">till the morning of eric actually picked</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">the topic</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">we did food security more global food</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:22.400" style="s2">security but</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:24.000" style="s2">what&#39;s about to come down the pipeline i</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.400" end="00:02:27.360" style="s2">think is going to be rather devastating</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.000" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">in the world um did we solve it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.360" end="00:02:32.000" style="s2">no no we did not really even come we got</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.000" style="s2">a little too into how do we get to 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">000 people um which is what my other</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.000" end="00:02:37.360" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">is which is the meta learning magic we</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.360" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">held</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:42.640" style="s2">our very first of the six-week course we</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">held week one this last week we</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.640" end="00:02:44.640" style="s2">concentrated on health and i thought it</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">actually went</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.640" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">very well it was i was expecting to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:49.280" style="s2">little more of a show a little more</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.280" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">we have to find the power here and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">massage it</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:56.879" style="s2">and make it work and i actually found</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.879" style="s2">that we just kind of like when we did it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.879" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">that there was a lot of power that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.879" end="00:03:02.879" style="s2">happened in the in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:04.879" style="s2">and we were able to people either came</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.879" end="00:03:07.840" style="s2">with meta problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.879" end="00:03:09.760" style="s2">like myself or ones that we i do think</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.840" end="00:03:11.519" style="s2">ended up getting a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.760" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">a little bit of an improvement on and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.519" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">we&#39;ll see next week if people took um</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.000" style="s2">natural action on their goals right</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">whether it was something that</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.000" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">that is gonna be more and i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.280" style="s2">excited</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:26.480" style="s2">it&#39;s hard for me to wait this six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.280" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">like i just want the next thing coming</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.480" end="00:03:29.599" style="s2">and so i honestly don&#39;t need help from</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:31.920" style="s2">anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.599" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">i just need patience with myself and to</p>

<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">balance of like getting my</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.360" end="00:03:39.280" style="s2">my life in order and truly just allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:40.959" style="s2">the process</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.959" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">creating the sixth week during the six</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">weeks so</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">that is my update</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:54.879" style="s2">my project is conferrati it is meant to</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:55.920" style="s2">be an information source that earns your</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.879" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">and then sort of the sister project</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">wikilection which is that same</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">information source you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.519" style="s2">are the information source earns your</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">trust but centered around politics</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.519" end="00:04:10.560" style="s2">um i have been working with someone on</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:13.680" style="s2">the prototype for wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.560" end="00:04:15.760" style="s2">and then uh recently have sort of done a</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.680" end="00:04:16.720" style="s2">bit of a pivot to focus on conferadi</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.760" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.720" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve been working with that same</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">developer and bentley just to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:23.040" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:25.040" style="s2">if uh going out a platform is to do the</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.040" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">right route what uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.040" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">what what technologies to use that sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:31.280" style="s2">of thing um</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">so still working on the specs for</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.280" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">confronting itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">and we&#39;ll continue doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">hopefully get that project started soon</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:45.120" style="s2">i actually did think of something i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.880" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">trying to work through in my head which</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.120" end="00:04:50.240" style="s2">is whether or not solution raisings</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">should start its own youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.240" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">either takeover idea cafe&#39;s channel</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:55.759" style="s2">which has</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">just under 100 subscribers um or start</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.759" end="00:04:59.600" style="s2">its own partly because i want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:01.840" style="s2">i know i can&#39;t do it on my own but i</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.600" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">want to do a reach out to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:06.800" style="s2">like existing people on the platform who</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">have a lot of subscribers and have them</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.800" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">host the solutions i actually am hosting</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">a solution raising this thursday with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">lot of the mtmlm people</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.759" style="s2">i put it out to the antelom community</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:17.440" style="s2">not looking for people with influencers</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:18.960" style="s2">and it ended up being the creators that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.440" end="00:05:21.039" style="s2">are more comfortable being on camera</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.960" end="00:05:22.880" style="s2">to come and participate in that and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.039" end="00:05:24.800" style="s2">got me thinking that could be a way to</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.880" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">grow solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.800" end="00:05:28.000" style="s2">but i also don&#39;t want to do it on my own</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">like i really</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.000" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">want like someone else who wants to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:33.440" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:35.280" style="s2">a youtube channel right take on like the</p>

<p begin="00:05:40.000" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">taking on too much for me whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.280" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">good idea at all whether i just keep it</p>

<p begin="00:05:49.759" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">like work through</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">the pros and cons of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.759" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">i think idea cafe and solution raisings</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.080" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">are close enough that none of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">viewers would like</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">unsubscribe because it was so different</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">i think that&#39;s good um</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:14.479" style="s2">yeah and if if you do have a youtube</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.800" end="00:06:16.160" style="s2">channel you can always give someone else</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:28.080" style="s2">of doing that i guess i guess one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.560" end="00:06:29.600" style="s2">questions would be if i continue doing</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.080" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">on my wednesday morning solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.600" end="00:06:35.440" style="s2">which is basically just game b people</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">um and then i&#39;m also reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.440" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">influencers to be like hey i noticed you</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">that that is which is kind of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.720" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">of what idea cafe was to begin with was</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">to reach out to influencers and have</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:49.120" style="s2">them bring</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:03.759" style="s2">the other ones so that the um</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.080" end="00:07:04.960" style="s2">influencers themselves can point to a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.759" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">hopefully slightly more</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.960" end="00:07:10.960" style="s2">um professional channel right that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">all of my random thoughts constantly but</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.960" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">do i keep my other game be on their</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">one um</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.240" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">or not what is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.560" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">yeah i think it&#39;s a bad idea to mix the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:27.199" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">ones and the other ones just because</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.199" end="00:07:31.280" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s interested in solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:32.240" style="s2">raising probably wouldn&#39;t be too</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.280" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">offended by</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">game b um</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">so it might be good to combine all those</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">and then have your</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">random thoughts on your jubilee channel</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:52.479" style="s2">that&#39;s a great way to to do it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:54.800" style="s2">always good to have kind of a general</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.479" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">place like a individual blog or</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.800" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">something so you can try things out not</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">time to graduate solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:08.879" style="s2">onto its own and it makes sense to take</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">over idea cafe right part of my worry is</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.879" end="00:08:12.560" style="s2">like</p>

<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:13.279" style="s2">brainstorm solutions if that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">you guys are looking to solve right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.279" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s not really for my project</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:25.920" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m kind of on the um</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">i haven&#39;t put much thought into it so uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">so yeah i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;m ready to use</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">that right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">i did hire someone to do some data entry</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.440" end="00:09:36.640" style="s2">and it worked okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">um but i&#39;d be looking at new</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">sources so yeah i think eventually</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">adrian and i pedro is data entry</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">something you&#39;re looking for yet adriel</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">not yet i mean it&#39;s definitely going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">be needed at some point but until</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:57.279" style="s2">sort of you know a more functional</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">prototype that&#39;s waiting for data entry</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.279" end="00:10:00.560" style="s2">then uh yeah it won&#39;t need that and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">for for</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.560" end="00:10:04.079" style="s2">the most point the goal is to use the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">prototype to gain an audience and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.079" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">check the audience to be like hey who</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:08.880" style="s2">wants to help</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.959" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">actually you know populate this thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.519" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">yeah for mine</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">um it it would be better to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:24.079" style="s2">building these</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.959" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">argument trees are</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.240" end="00:10:32.160" style="s2">they&#39;re designed to be easily understood</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.000" style="s2">but to do them well</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.160" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like creating a video or</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.000" end="00:10:37.040" style="s2">music you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.640" style="s2">it takes a lot of work and it looks</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.040" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">simple when it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.640" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">but to do it well it really takes some</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:43.279" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">although it could be seen as a puzzle so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:50.079" style="s2">it would be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.880" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">you know give people the um</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.079" end="00:10:54.880" style="s2">you know as volunteering they might</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">might also find it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.880" end="00:10:59.200" style="s2">pleasurable to to try and solve a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">problem like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.200" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">um so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">i can&#39;t think anymore to chat about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:11.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a good idea though</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">all right so who wants to be in the hot</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.920" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">seat then for an id in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">hey joe are you getting any um</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">i know radix not here so it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">not fair to have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">do that um but uh have you seen any more</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:32.000" style="s2">prototypes or</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">any more thing being deployed in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.000" end="00:11:36.240" style="s2">last several weeks</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:38.240" style="s2">i&#39;m not still seeing any movement on</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.240" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">wiki election itself</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.240" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">like on the earlier prototype um</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">i think that radek was starting a new</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">job soon</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:48.480" style="s2">so i think if it&#39;s not done soon it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.480" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">not not getting done um</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.680" end="00:11:57.040" style="s2">yeah that part i wasn&#39;t sure if it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:11:59.920" style="s2">going to happen it sounded sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.040" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">up in the air um and that&#39;s i guess a</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.920" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">part of the reason for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">pivot to conforti to sort of also help</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:08.560" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">wiki election and with this part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.560" end="00:12:10.880" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:12.399" style="s2">intentionally being sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.880" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">developers and having</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.399" end="00:12:16.079" style="s2">closer to i guess a proper development</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">environment where</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.079" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">i can go you know and hire one or two</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:22.839" style="s2">people on upwork</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:27.279" style="s2">and then hopefully also have uh you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.839" end="00:12:30.240" style="s2">or erratic assist with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.279" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">yeah so right now you&#39;re you&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.240" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">writing up some specifications yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:40.079" style="s2">yeah and uh have thought a bit on this</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.079" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">is it worth it to go the platform route</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:47.279" style="s2">and i do think you know there&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">end up being like five to ten portals</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.279" end="00:12:50.880" style="s2">in the not too distant future um and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.880" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">going to sort of be a common way to spin</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.480" end="00:12:56.160" style="s2">off information</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">because con fraud is going to sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.160" end="00:12:58.399" style="s2">the main one but that&#39;s going to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:06.560" style="s2">unwieldy</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.399" end="00:13:08.639" style="s2">fast for for various topics um</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.560" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">yes because if it did there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.639" end="00:13:11.839" style="s2">else we could talk about that but</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:13.440" style="s2">i do always feel a bit weird with</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.839" end="00:13:16.000" style="s2">getting super technical</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.440" end="00:13:18.240" style="s2">on a channel that&#39;s not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.000" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">meant for that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.240" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m down with that i can also turn</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">off my camera and</p>

<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:32.240" style="s2">want to discuss that today we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:34.079" style="s2">about um i know with brent weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.240" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">getting basically kicked out by facebook</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.079" end="00:13:37.200" style="s2">and jim rutt coming back from a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">sabbatical to kind of say</p>

<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">this was always a problem we always knew</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">facebook needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:53.600" style="s2">um have an alternative but the issue is</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">there&#39;s dozens of alternatives and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.600" end="00:13:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a reason we&#39;re on facebook like</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">it feels weird to now be like well now</p>

<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:17.920" style="s2">platforms and yet needed like it</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:19.440" style="s2">was kind of needed a year ago and a year</p>

<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">changes the direction of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:32.240" style="s2">i think you know oh and there&#39;s already</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.000" style="s2">part of having the facebook group do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">mean shutting down the facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.000" end="00:14:48.880" style="s2">completely or with all of its brand</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:51.440" style="s2">like what happens oh that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.880" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">things that was more for yesterday</p>

<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">because you&#39;ll get very confused as to</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:02.320" style="s2">what together tech is even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:04.480" style="s2">in the url</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.320" end="00:15:05.519" style="s2">um anyway yeah i can put that on the</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.360" end="00:15:21.279" style="s2">now but it looks like they</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.920" end="00:15:23.040" style="s2">suspended his account and put it back up</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.279" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">but it was mostly uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.040" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">automated system</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:29.360" style="s2">yeah and then there was questions around</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">like it said something about it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.360" end="00:15:31.920" style="s2">reviewed and</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">banned and so it&#39;s like well wait it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.920" end="00:15:34.880" style="s2">automatically reviewed</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:40.000" style="s2">we&#39;re also having reports of like things</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.079" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">that would get them banned now</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.000" end="00:15:44.240" style="s2">um that like it&#39;s like eight years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.160" style="s2">you said this thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.240" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">right it was false information it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.160" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">like yeah you guys weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">onto false information then like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:53.040" style="s2">really gonna go back and ban</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">someone over what they right what they</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.040" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">posted eight years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">like it&#39;s facebook is scrambling people</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:02.320" style="s2">are scrambling</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s a very chaotic time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.320" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">this is part of why</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:06.880" style="s2">influencer culture like having one</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">person with a million followers on my</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.880" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">new brett has um</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">that then when it goes down you lose</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">those followers like how else are people</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">supposed to find him right he&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:16.639" style="s2">youtube he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.480" style="s2">got his his personal channel but people</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.639" end="00:16:20.320" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know to hit like</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.480" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">we need to build our whatever we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.320" end="00:16:25.279" style="s2">building in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">way that&#39;s resilient right when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.279" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">like we know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">the platforms are going to kick us off</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">what happens when they do</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">right like where where&#39;s the fire</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:34.320" style="s2">meeting place</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.079" style="s2">right like when you go leave the house</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.320" end="00:16:37.680" style="s2">and go to the when internet goes down</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.079" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">where do we meet where do we</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.680" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">where do we actually um</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.680" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s part of what metal and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.880" end="00:16:47.440" style="s2">room magic is um the magic</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.959" style="s2">in it is that it&#39;s growing outwards in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.440" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">way that hopefully we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.959" end="00:16:51.519" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to be dependent on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.759" style="s2">platform because although we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.519" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">we&#39;re on facebook and facebook messenger</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.759" end="00:16:56.160" style="s2">if it goes away i know the six people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">my group</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.160" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">right and as we grow up from there we</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:01.680" style="s2">have people&#39;s email addresses it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">somewhat easier to be like facebook</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:05.839" style="s2">kicked us off we&#39;re on discord now this</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">kicked us off we&#39;re here now</p>

<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.520" style="s2">we&#39;re not making much movement so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not as valuable we could switch to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.520" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">every other week or something</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:14.080" style="s2">or just even wait until someone says</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.080" end="00:19:17.760" style="s2">someone says oh i need some help on</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">to create that post and then i can try</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">kind of go in and</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">um take it off of the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:54.960" style="s2">places that might be confusing people if</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">they find it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.960" end="00:23:01.600" style="s2">written differently maybe just</p>

<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">on that post because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">be too complicated</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">yeah and then i think like we put up the</p>

<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.120" style="s2">weeks or three weeks prior we can start</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.600" end="00:23:42.720" style="s2">start start reaching out to people and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">if they don&#39;t respond then they lose</p>

<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.760" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have anyone in the hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">we&#39;re saying you know just to hang out</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.760" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to i have another</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:04.720" style="s2">conversation in half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">i booked them up back-to-back because i</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.720" end="00:24:09.120" style="s2">knew i&#39;d be</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.919" end="00:24:15.919" style="s2">too much time in between yeah we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.880" end="00:24:18.159" style="s2">need to hang out and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.919" end="00:24:19.679" style="s2">and spend time for the next half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.159" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">if we don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.679" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">to to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.120" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">okay yeah i mean if if wants to hang out</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t mind chatting about the tech</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">stuff for five to ten minutes just to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:35.520" style="s2">yeah all right how about i leave and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:36.640" style="s2">guys continue with that and stop the</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.520" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">recording when you want because it might</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.640" end="00:24:38.720" style="s2">be that it helps somebody else with our</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:40.960" style="s2">project as well</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.720" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">yes it&#39;s probably stuff all right thanks</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.960" end="00:24:46.960" style="s2">guys i&#39;ll see you on friday</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">all right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.960" end="00:24:51.039" style="s2">all right um so i was going through and</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">sort of trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.039" end="00:24:55.039" style="s2">is it worth doing the extra work to make</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">this uh platform</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.039" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">um knowing that sort of then each portal</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:05.600" style="s2">becomes its own its own project</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">um and that is sort of the i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.600" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">terminology and sort of i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">structure and how i was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">splitting it up</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:15.120" style="s2">is the conference platform itself would</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:15.840" style="s2">be called just that it&#39;s the platform</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.120" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.840" end="00:25:19.520" style="s2">users would never use that directly they</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">would only be using it through portals</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.520" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">and then like there would end up being a</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">portal for</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:27.840" style="s2">for wikilection a portal for</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:30.559" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going converati end up</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.840" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">being a portal for like game b projects</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.559" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">um the idea being that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">the platform sort of shares</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:42.240" style="s2">the data between the portals</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">not all the portals would like no portal</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.240" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">what what have all the information it</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:45.919" style="s2">would just sort of be a slice right so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.919" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">wiki election would be really only be</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:50.559" style="s2">looking like politicians and lobbyists</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">and people</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.559" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">and for organizations that we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">looking at like parties and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:25:57.360" style="s2">lobbying groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">um in the comment variety what we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.360" end="00:26:00.159" style="s2">looking at like organizations and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">know people</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.159" end="00:26:05.679" style="s2">in the c-suite and on boards</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">um so it would be sharing the data that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.679" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">way it would be sharing the interface</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:13.679" style="s2">and so like you know the the um</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">the just the way that the navigation is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.679" end="00:26:18.720" style="s2">structure everything in the top bar</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.279" style="s2">like the icon and the the label of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.720" end="00:26:22.159" style="s2">portal</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.279" end="00:26:22.799" style="s2">will change the positioning of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.159" end="00:26:24.960" style="s2">module</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.799" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">selector would be the same and it would</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.960" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">just be what modules are inside</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:33.760" style="s2">right so like regulation</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.120" style="s2">might have like people and elections and</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.760" end="00:26:36.559" style="s2">and stuff like that as modules and</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.120" end="00:26:39.520" style="s2">whereas of course confronted wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.559" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">have elections</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.520" end="00:26:42.880" style="s2">um and then that shared interface is</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.880" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">sort of the interface used to build the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">pages itself and those will have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">in common where</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">really there&#39;s going to be pages that</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">just sort of you know a home page</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:57.760" style="s2">a page to list records and a page to</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">show records that&#39;s kind of the core</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.760" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">of it right we&#39;re like the top level</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:02.960" style="s2">navigation for</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:04.840" style="s2">wiki election like it&#39;s going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.960" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">being you know things like</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.840" end="00:27:11.279" style="s2">people organizations elections</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">um that might end up or i guess and</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.279" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">and then you can go to each one of those</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">and then that would let you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:19.360" style="s2">drill into the underlying data so if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">go to legislation</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.360" end="00:27:22.399" style="s2">first of all probably have to search by</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">your area because</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.399" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">it&#39;s going to default to say oh if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">in canada it&#39;s going to show me canadian</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">legislation um i can still you know if</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.480" style="s2">being nosy i can still go look at the us</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.360" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.480" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">it would help you find one piece of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:39.600" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:40.960" style="s2">and then when you go to view that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.600" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">record you can see you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.960" end="00:27:43.679" style="s2">who voted on it who submitted it and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">can start to drill into the information</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.679" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.240" style="s2">um and then finally the goal is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">they would have a shared login</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.240" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">so like if you&#39;re logged into one it</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:52.799" style="s2">would be a bit like google right where</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.799" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">your app selector and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">switch apps and it keeps you logged in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:58.799" style="s2">it&#39;s the exact same account and now</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:02.640" style="s2">you&#39;re just in you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.799" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">google docs instead of</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.640" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">google sheets</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">um so that is sort of the the basic idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.640" end="00:28:12.720" style="s2">behind what</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:14.640" style="s2">the platform would sort of be providing</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.720" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">and then each portal</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.640" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">effectively wouldn&#39;t need to specify</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">what objects or what tables</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s looking at along with any sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:27.200" style="s2">built-in filters like the you know four</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.200" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">on wikilection they would mostly just be</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:32.720" style="s2">looking at politicians so like unless</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.919" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.720" end="00:28:37.840" style="s2">a ceo has some sort of a background</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.919" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">that involves politics then they</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.840" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t show up on work election at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:47.360" style="s2">um similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">is that sort of top level setup where</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.360" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">each portal is put into modules</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:53.360" style="s2">and then that&#39;s just you know your top</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:54.880" style="s2">level options like wikileaks</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.360" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">having people organizations elections</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.880" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">and so on um and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">each of those modules would sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:01.279" style="s2">designed to allow for okay you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:02.960" style="s2">to find this record</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.279" end="00:29:04.799" style="s2">you&#39;re going to view it and here&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.960" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">know the things that you can drill into</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.799" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">and how that layout will look</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:12.240" style="s2">um and then those would end up being</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">accessed</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.240" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">initially just through a subdomain on</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:17.559" style="s2">converati</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:18.720" style="s2">right so you would have like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.559" end="00:29:20.960" style="s2">app.confronti.com</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.720" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">is the just the main app that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.960" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">end up being super unwieldy</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:25.559" style="s2">and then we&#39;d start out with</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:28.159" style="s2">wikilection.com</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.559" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">wikilection.conferrati.com being</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.159" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">wiki election with the end goal for that</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">to end up being mapped</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:39.120" style="s2">to also just app.confrontid.com</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">um and then spinning up new new portals</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.120" end="00:29:43.760" style="s2">will sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">like that and that part you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.760" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not trying to be salesforce it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">not trying to be like everything is</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:48.960" style="s2">super streamlined to set up if it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:50.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.960" end="00:29:52.960" style="s2">editing config files and trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">enter in field names in</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.960" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">x y coordinates on a canvas whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:30:00.559" style="s2">needed to</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.960" style="s2">to power that but but that basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.559" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">the platform really just being like</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.960" end="00:30:07.440" style="s2">that canvas to hold or to power these</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">portals</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.440" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">and the portal displays modules which</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.520" style="s2">can then</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">sort of have you unique controls to look</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.520" end="00:30:17.679" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">information to find it to modify it etc</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.679" end="00:30:22.399" style="s2">um but then those modules could also be</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:26.080" style="s2">reused across any of the other portals</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.399" end="00:30:27.919" style="s2">does that make sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.080" end="00:30:29.760" style="s2">i think in general if you know from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.919" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">beginning that</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.760" end="00:30:33.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to want to have a flexible</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">ui that can</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.520" end="00:30:39.279" style="s2">display you know different</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">content and and maybe even hide</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.279" end="00:30:43.360" style="s2">different parts out</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">and filter and sort then it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.360" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.200" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">now i i was also hoping that the core</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.679" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">chunk of this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">technology could also be used on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:59.519" style="s2">completely different</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">database of data like you know for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.519" end="00:31:02.960" style="s2">no code you know choosing no code no</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.000" style="s2">code</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.960" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">software and stuff like that right um</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.000" end="00:31:09.760" style="s2">so that would be a separate database</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">than the conference one</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.760" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">in the end it might end up being in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:15.279" style="s2">same one</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">because there&#39;s there&#39;s gonna be core</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.279" end="00:31:18.480" style="s2">things like organizations</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">that will probably spread across every</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.480" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">single app or you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.120" style="s2">close to it and so there might not be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2">lot of bleed over to start with but</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.120" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">eventually you know if you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:32.080" style="s2">or you know entries in the organization</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">table for things like google and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.080" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">microsoft and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:37.039" style="s2">and things like that and they are</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:39.039" style="s2">involved in some of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.039" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">you know here&#39;s 10 apps that that one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.039" end="00:31:41.760" style="s2">bought by microsoft and that one&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">google</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.760" end="00:31:46.080" style="s2">and you know here and then also you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:47.600" style="s2">using these same like organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.080" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">people and projects</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.600" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">for the gamebee projects you can start</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:52.960" style="s2">to reuse sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">all of those lists anywhere that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.960" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">needed and as</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">they grow yeah i think to start with</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:31:58.240" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be overlap</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">but once you start to like track</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.240" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">organizations and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:04.399" style="s2">you would kind of want it in the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:06.480" style="s2">list and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.399" end="00:32:07.760" style="s2">yeah some of the apps won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.480" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">organizations at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.760" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">so like if it&#39;s a whole bunch of home</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:14.240" style="s2">schoolers that are trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:17.200" style="s2">virtual classrooms and they want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.240" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">make sure the kids are diverse then</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.200" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">you&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">you know that&#39;d just be a small database</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">so having assisted we could spin it up</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:28.720" style="s2">so the added complexity those</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:31.039" style="s2">but and all the designs have always</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.720" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">wanted it to be very flexible on the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.039" end="00:32:33.760" style="s2">views</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">so if you have that then yeah as long as</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.760" end="00:32:38.000" style="s2">you configure those views</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.120" style="s2">then you can have multiple sites looking</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.000" end="00:32:41.519" style="s2">at the same database</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.120" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">or you know you can create another site</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.519" end="00:32:47.039" style="s2">and have it have its own database so</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:50.320" style="s2">right it should be flexible enough</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.039" end="00:32:52.799" style="s2">to to do that um</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.320" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">yeah so i would i would leave that in</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.799" end="00:32:57.120" style="s2">this in the requirements</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">uh and then just whenever you have your</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.120" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">developers</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">looking at it whether it&#39;s me erratic</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:05.120" style="s2">just you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">look at it see if there&#39;s any really</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.120" end="00:33:10.320" style="s2">challenging bits to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:12.480" style="s2">right but it would only be like</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.320" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">five or ten percent increase i think in</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.480" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">the okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">cool development that&#39;s good yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:19.279" style="s2">then i think it would</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:21.279" style="s2">be passing off some of the development</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.279" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">work to me or to whoever ends up doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.279" end="00:33:25.279" style="s2">that like</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:27.840" style="s2">portal setup side yeah which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.279" end="00:33:28.720" style="s2">what i want right it&#39;s where i can go in</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.840" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">there and as long as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.720" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">the platform is still doing its thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">and up and online</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">then i can keep building out the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:36.159" style="s2">individual portals and then as i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">oh i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.159" end="00:33:41.279" style="s2">afford on this portal until i have these</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">features that&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.279" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">immediate future that i see for con</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">variety is where there&#39;s the team</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">working on the platform to sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:48.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">like the new pieces of lego hey we just</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.000" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">came out you know with</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">a new wing for a spaceship great now i</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:56.480" style="s2">can build that spaceship that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.320" style="s2">been planning something similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.480" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">where as the new controls come out as</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.320" end="00:34:01.679" style="s2">there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">you know as new new uh tables are added</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.679" end="00:34:04.360" style="s2">to the data set</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">you can start to figure out where that</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.360" end="00:34:09.599" style="s2">fits in</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.040" style="s2">like you know the wiki election portal</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.599" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">might you know it would definitely show</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.040" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">legislation</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">on friday main app might like at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:17.760" style="s2">deepest levels</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.760" end="00:34:18.960" style="s2">be adding that to the scoring but you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.760" end="00:34:20.720" style="s2">would have to dig in sort of very</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.960" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">specific ways to ever actually see</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.720" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">legislation in that side of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:26.159" style="s2">but you know it would still be in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.760" style="s2">underlying data and i expect that some</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.159" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">apps might start out being completely</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.760" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">isolated</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2">they would still be in that overall pool</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:33.839" style="s2">of like we could eventually connect</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:36.159" style="s2">those tables to something else</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.839" end="00:34:37.200" style="s2">if needed but in the end if it was just</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.159" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">three tables that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.200" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">always lived on their own the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">platform could still support that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:46.320" style="s2">yeah yeah cool cool</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">um and then there was the other part</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.320" end="00:34:50.560" style="s2">where we were talking about potentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">using ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.639" style="s2">and i had gone through and sort of tried</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">to figure out which of the features that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.639" end="00:35:00.079" style="s2">ruby on rails provides um what i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:01.920" style="s2">be wanting to use</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.079" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">and i used that same article that i had</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.920" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">sent before</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.599" end="00:35:07.359" style="s2">and honestly almost everything i i read</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.160" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.359" end="00:35:11.040" style="s2">like some weren&#39;t going to be needed for</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.160" end="00:35:14.000" style="s2">the first</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.040" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">six months or a year but like down the</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.000" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">road i can see like yeah i would totally</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">want that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:21.119" style="s2">right like things like payments</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">where i definitely don&#39;t need that on</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.119" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">day one but like</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">within you know six months or a year</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">there&#39;s probably going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:30.400" style="s2">various reasons to do payments and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">the ability to just have okay great they</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.400" end="00:35:33.599" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">a gem that you can plug in and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.599" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">going to need merchant accounts and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">and and stuff like that but from</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:42.079" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve read</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">about ruby on rails that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.079" end="00:35:45.040" style="s2">selling point</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.960" style="s2">is that it might not be exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.040" end="00:35:49.359" style="s2">want but for prototype purposes</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.960" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">and you know you can always tweak it too</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.359" end="00:35:52.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">it being that like you get started there</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.560" end="00:35:58.000" style="s2">it can you know really</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:59.839" style="s2">streamline that initial development</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.000" end="00:36:01.200" style="s2">and then after that i i think it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.839" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">regular</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.200" end="00:36:05.760" style="s2">ruby development like to do stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">not in a gym</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.760" end="00:36:10.079" style="s2">um like i went through that page yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.240" style="s2">don&#39;t think ruby development would be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.079" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">any faster than</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.240" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">um right yeah like just</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:19.119" style="s2">developing new things i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">expect to be faster it&#39;s just the gems</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.119" end="00:36:22.320" style="s2">that speed things up</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">but i&#39;m saying a gym on ruby i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.320" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">think is any faster than</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.839" style="s2">using the pre-built tools from whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">provider you use</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.839" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:37.119" style="s2">payments so they&#39;ve all got that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.079" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">those levels of libraries</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.119" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">yeah if you&#39;re talking about it being a</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">back end and then you have a front end</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">if you&#39;re going with a payment provider</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">you don&#39;t use you use the payment</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">provider as</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">the back end</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:54.880" style="s2">well no but this is like i i assume</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">it then allows like you know it it it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.880" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">provides that gateway for your software</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">the gateways right and for because</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna need to be something</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">on your own back end to talk to but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t need that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">that&#39;s like a one line</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:11.839" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">i mean you you have your okay your back</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">end api</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">you know on thing and it it just needs</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">kind of a pass-through to get to theirs</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:24.480" style="s2">to validate</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:25.760" style="s2">who you are but after that it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.480" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">handled from the client</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.760" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">directly to their back end right</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.280" end="00:37:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of old tech yeah i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.599" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">weirded out by</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.200" end="00:37:37.280" style="s2">the conversation around ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">then it seems like everyone that</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.280" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">that works on that talks about it as</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:42.960" style="s2">though that&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">did see a friendship three years ago it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.960" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.480" style="s2">but that&#39;s all it is this article is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">from 2020</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.480" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">well people still write and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:54.079" style="s2">talking new articles based on old</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:55.920" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.079" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">you know what i&#39;m saying yeah but this</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.920" end="00:37:59.359" style="s2">is from like</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">a ruby on rails dev house like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.359" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">what they do is they</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">i was looking at their at their site and</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:07.839" style="s2">sort of what they offer and their core</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">technologies are ruby on rails and react</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.839" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">like that&#39;s the things that they have on</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">their site as like right well ruby&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.040" style="s2">rails is what they know so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">that&#39;s what their articles would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.040" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">you&#39;re looking at a bias right but i</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">and if you want to send me the articles</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.359" end="00:38:26.640" style="s2">then i can see if there&#39;s anything in it</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:29.200" style="s2">it&#39;s still just that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.640" end="00:38:30.640" style="s2">yeah i i can send you that one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.200" end="00:38:33.520" style="s2">really just sort of talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.640" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">the the gems but if it&#39;s like if all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.520" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:37.280" style="s2">or at least you know the majority of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">different dev environments already have</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s you know just like is what</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">technologies because i know that react</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">is a front end so what other back ends</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">would have this kind of a library that i</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">can go see</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">what sort of pages they have and what</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">sort of library are you saying people</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">for payments you directly hit the back</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.800" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">end of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">of the payment provider you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:04.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re doing a pass-through it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">a simple pass-through that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.640" end="00:39:10.240" style="s2">that gym can do a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:13.359" style="s2">i mean maybe it&#39;s hooking it up to your</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.240" end="00:39:13.359" style="s2">database and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:18.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean i would have to look</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">at it but you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.240" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">i haven&#39;t handled payments but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:22.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">you know payments have been done without</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.560" end="00:39:33.040" style="s2">ruby on rails for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">it just it does seem like yeah it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.040" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">usually a crap ton of work</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">like i&#39;ve worked on projects</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">i just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">i mean i don&#39;t think you choose a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">so which i mean so but everything else</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">you do would be harder on ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">then because you don&#39;t if we&#39;re if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">using what radix already using</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:59.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t write a back end</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a it&#39;s the pre-built back</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.040" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">end when you create the database it is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">back end</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">and then what like is then the front end</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:12.079" style="s2">just connecting</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">and and working directly on the the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.079" end="00:40:16.720" style="s2">database</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">what&#39;s actually doing the work on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.720" end="00:40:20.400" style="s2">automatedly built api</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.040" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s similar to ruby on</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:27.040" style="s2">rails that</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">you know instead of so in ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.040" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">you have to like</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">write the database then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">write the ruby code which is very very</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:34.880" style="s2">fast because it&#39;s a prototype you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:37.040" style="s2">because it&#39;s a thing but</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.880" end="00:40:38.960" style="s2">on the on the new ones you you&#39;d write</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.040" end="00:40:41.440" style="s2">the database and it creates that api</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.960" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">piece for you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.440" end="00:40:47.359" style="s2">and then you use graphql so your front</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:51.119" style="s2">end can decide what information it wants</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.359" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">now so there may be you know there</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.119" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">it may it may be that</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.720" end="00:41:07.920" style="s2">yeah it really depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">complicated your payment</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.920" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">needs are like if you only have like one</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:13.760" style="s2">price</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">for everyone then you in your database</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.760" end="00:41:17.839" style="s2">you just need to know paid or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">you know are they recurring and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.839" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">like that so that&#39;s really short</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">if it&#39;s like you know you have a whole</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">bunch if you have different skus for</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">thousands of different products and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.960" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">need to integrate that with the database</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">of products</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.800" style="s2">but still you&#39;re going to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">time with integration because the gym is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.800" end="00:41:38.800" style="s2">not going to be built for that specific</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:41.280" style="s2">how you&#39;re storing that data right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.800" end="00:41:43.119" style="s2">we need to work with the the specifics</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.280" end="00:41:46.839" style="s2">of however the building system is</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.119" end="00:41:50.880" style="s2">designed within con variety um</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.839" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">so in my notes from the last time that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.880" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">we talked about this i</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.400" end="00:41:58.319" style="s2">go ahead i mean the problem is you would</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:01.520" style="s2">need to find</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.319" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">some ruby on rails developers</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.520" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">right right yeah that part i guess i</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">guess i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">like trying to come to terms with</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">the information that i&#39;ve read and sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">of why ruby even still exists at all</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">like why anybody would ever choose</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:17.760" style="s2">to to to use it like why they&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.800" style="s2">coming out with</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.760" end="00:42:23.839" style="s2">new gems the same reasons works</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.800" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">because people are still pushing forward</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.839" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">i mean you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a bad thing it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:32.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:42.960" style="s2">i think part of it too is also wondering</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">why wiki election is stalled and i feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.960" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">like part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">it like if there was sort of more things</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">that could just get plugged in</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:53.119" style="s2">the goal is to be able you know to add</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">any of these new features</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.119" end="00:42:56.839" style="s2">very easily we&#39;re just like oh we want</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.079" style="s2">to do this great that&#39;s 10 hours instead</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.839" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">of the 300 hours</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.079" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">the things he&#39;s trying to build wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">exist in a gym</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">right so i don&#39;t think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:10.720" style="s2">that&#39;s related to the gems</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.760" end="00:43:12.440" style="s2">okay and there&#39;s no gem for you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.720" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">abstracting out</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.440" end="00:43:16.960" style="s2">relationships the scoring and all that</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:19.119" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.960" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">i mean you can go with ruby on rails but</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.119" end="00:43:23.040" style="s2">i can&#39;t even manage a ruby on rails</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:24.400" style="s2">i mean i could from a completely project</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.040" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">management standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.400" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">but i wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t want to spend the time</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.920" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">looking at ruby on rails code because</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:37.920" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to switch tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">um so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.920" end="00:43:42.720" style="s2">but i don&#39;t yeah i just</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.160" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s so fast that um</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">that it&#39;s worth switching me personally</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:56.800" style="s2">to switch tech</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:58.400" style="s2">right okay um so then is</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.800" end="00:44:00.880" style="s2">because in my notes from the last time</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.400" end="00:44:03.839" style="s2">we talked about this i had sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:04.640" style="s2">notes to compare ruby on rails to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.839" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">firebase</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.640" end="00:44:08.880" style="s2">is firebase sort of like the back end in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:10.960" style="s2">this case and it&#39;s also so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.880" end="00:44:13.440" style="s2">database and it&#39;s the automated api</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.960" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">that you were talking about yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.440" end="00:44:19.440" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:23.760" style="s2">now like i don&#39;t know if firebase like</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.440" end="00:44:26.720" style="s2">has an equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.760" end="00:44:28.480" style="s2">plug-in for payments pretty sure they</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.720" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.480" end="00:44:33.040" style="s2">but firebase has like the built-in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">membership and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">okay yeah when i went to look at that</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">article</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">let me move this window over so i can</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">switch although i&#39;m using mongodb</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">instead of firebase but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">um yeah because when i went and looked</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:49.280" style="s2">at towards the</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">spot yeah when i was looking at that</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.280" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">page actually here i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">put this in the chat just so you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">sort of see the same thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.000" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">the same article as last time when i</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:01.839" style="s2">went through i was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">which of these i i would use it more</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.839" end="00:45:04.800" style="s2">came down to like their categories where</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">certain categories i&#39;m like i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.800" end="00:45:07.760" style="s2">skin in that game</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">i mean if it was useful sure like stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.760" end="00:45:12.720" style="s2">for debugging and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">what you know i&#39;m not going to enforce</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.720" end="00:45:16.000" style="s2">any of that on</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:17.440" style="s2">the the developers because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.000" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">really have an opinion there</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.440" end="00:45:21.760" style="s2">um but like pretty much everything in</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:25.359" style="s2">the active record sections</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.760" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">in testing authentication um their part</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.359" end="00:45:28.160" style="s2">on api sounded</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">interesting but i mean if that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.160" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">automated that might not be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not remitting the wheel the part</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:37.599" style="s2">on security</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:40.800" style="s2">um payments they all have security</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.599" end="00:45:44.079" style="s2">authentication and authorization</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:46.880" style="s2">so mongodb firebase</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.079" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">um ruby on rails right oh oh okay so</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.880" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">that one&#39;s gone so they all have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:55.280" style="s2">the payment thing you know i</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">you know the like if you go to firebase</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.280" end="00:45:58.960" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.599" style="s2">they don&#39;t say anything but you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.960" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">they have a</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.599" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a one-page thing on here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:07.359" style="s2">how you hook up</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:10.480" style="s2">uh stripe um</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.359" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">okay but it but you know so they they</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.480" end="00:46:15.280" style="s2">could have it could be more</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">like they may feel they may already have</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.280" end="00:46:18.319" style="s2">but the thing is if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">a react front end</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.319" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">they don&#39;t have any screens but</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">i mean maybe they have innate</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:31.440" style="s2">you know back end apis the sync up</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:34.800" style="s2">the stripe um</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.440" end="00:46:38.160" style="s2">like cancellations the stripe</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.800" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">chargebacks and sync it up to a database</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.160" end="00:46:41.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">whatever database back-end ruby you have</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.440" end="00:46:45.520" style="s2">your ruby on rails hooked up too</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">right so maybe they have some more</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.520" end="00:46:50.240" style="s2">advanced features like that but just</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">charging you know just like charging a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.240" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">credit card</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:54.800" style="s2">i could do that without a back end at</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">all just use right yeah and i&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.800" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">the prop for billing back in right to</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">handle chargebacks and all that stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">like to whatever extent for most of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:05.680" style="s2">businesses</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.880" style="s2">you just do those through the stripe</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.680" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.880" end="00:47:10.960" style="s2">right how do you need that synced up to</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">your thing so that if someone does a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.960" end="00:47:14.240" style="s2">chargeback they lose access to the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">database</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.240" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">well it&#39;s so it the the charges would</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">end up being for it but but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">for just like any app on the platform to</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:25.280" style="s2">use right it could end up being</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">if there was a store at some point it it</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.280" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">it it it could use it</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">i imagine one of the first uses is going</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:31.119" style="s2">to be like a very light version of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">patreon</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.119" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">where it&#39;s not just paying for that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:36.480" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s probably step one is billing for</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.480" end="00:47:41.040" style="s2">itself and then step two is</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.079" end="00:47:42.319" style="s2">billing for projects yeah i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.040" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">assume that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.319" end="00:47:45.760" style="s2">ruby on rails gym would handle that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.760" end="00:47:49.920" style="s2">yeah um the two gems i talked about one</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">of them was built by</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.920" end="00:47:54.000" style="s2">it looks like shopify and i mean with</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">how they wrote it i wouldn&#39;t be at all</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.000" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">surprised if that was available in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:47:59.040" style="s2">bunch of technologies because it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.040" end="00:48:04.640" style="s2">um payments yeah there we go a</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:07.359" style="s2">multi-tenant subscription</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.640" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">kind of billing system i mean yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.359" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">they have that that wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:13.359" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:15.119" style="s2">firebase has built in right</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.359" end="00:48:17.200" style="s2">yeah i think in this case it&#39;s mostly</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.119" end="00:48:21.440" style="s2">just like</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.200" end="00:48:23.680" style="s2">the the api integration with</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.440" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">the popular gateways is basically how</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.680" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">they&#39;re doing it but payments is also</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">one of the things right um and then the</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">other things on that page was that there</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">was stuff to do with</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">uploading files which they it sounded</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:36.720" style="s2">like they had some interesting tools to</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:41.680" style="s2">do with like</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.720" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">you know um processing images and</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.680" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">i guess the thing for external storage</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:46.800" style="s2">is that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:48.000" style="s2">a common one too but has things you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.800" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">for if you&#39;re going to be storing some</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.000" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">files in the amazon elastic cloud or</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">google cloud storage et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:56.480" style="s2">they have james for that it&#39;s stuff for</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">scheduled and recurring jobs which</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.480" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">sounded</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">interesting because i think that was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">challenge that uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">the radak was having with the scoring</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">was like the one to calculate it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">when they actually trigger it and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:09.280" style="s2">sort of thing um and so they had some</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:11.440" style="s2">apps for</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.280" end="00:49:13.280" style="s2">these scheduling jobs and recurring jobs</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.440" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">stuff for search</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.280" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s all i think that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.400" style="s2">built in</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">on like the scheduling jobs that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">pretty standard fire based thing i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:26.960" style="s2">rather they have had trouble because</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">he&#39;d never done it before</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.960" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">but you just write a function and say</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">um okay yeah so if it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:38.880" style="s2">if it&#39;s you know six or one half a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.880" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">the other like if the majority of these</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">gems if it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:46.240" style="s2">if firebase is missing two of them i</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">don&#39;t care like</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.240" end="00:49:48.800" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to have every single</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">thing because it probably just has a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.800" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:53.680" style="s2">library where it&#39;s going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:56.720" style="s2">having something that that rails</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.680" end="00:49:59.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have um so as</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.720" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">as long as it has that same you know the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.839" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">idea of it being easier because you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.160" style="s2">just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:05.440" style="s2">i mean the easiest to double check if</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.160" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">you had a list</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.440" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">of the you know you talked about putting</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:10.839" style="s2">together a list and just glance at it</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">and say yeah firebase has that</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.839" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">firebase right um</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.839" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">um yeah like that page that i sent</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.720" style="s2">basically everything under those</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">headings because i was</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.720" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">i started to to go through and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">each one which headings</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:30.640" style="s2">um active record testing authentication</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.480" style="s2">security payments uploading files</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.640" end="00:50:34.640" style="s2">scheduling and recurring jobs search and</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.480" end="00:50:36.480" style="s2">admin panel</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.640" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">those sections sort of on that page i</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.480" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">sent i was going through like actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:42.960" style="s2">typing out each gem and then like for</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:43.359" style="s2">the first three i typed all of the gems</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.960" end="00:50:44.880" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.359" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">those headers i&#39;m like oh i just want</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.880" end="00:50:49.280" style="s2">all of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:50.720" style="s2">um and a big part of it too is i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.280" end="00:50:53.040" style="s2">know what gems are out there</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.720" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">and so if i were to end up using ruby</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.040" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">part of it would hopefully be</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:59.440" style="s2">you know finding a ruby developer who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:00.240" style="s2">used stuff in previous projects and sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.440" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">of has</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.240" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">they may have some stuff to suggest as</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">well which ends up being the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">for firebase right if you work with a</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:07.839" style="s2">firebase developer that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">they&#39;re going to have things that</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.839" end="00:51:11.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve used i mean ruby&#39;s been around</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.559" style="s2">longer</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.280" end="00:51:14.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s community is probably bigger</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.559" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.880" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">firebase or mongodb so it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">i didn&#39;t get them gonna be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">community kind of looks at ruby like you</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.319" style="s2">are like where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:32.240" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s there but why it there</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.319" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">that there was like it seemed like a lot</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.240" end="00:51:35.200" style="s2">of developers were</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:37.280" style="s2">shying away from it and being like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.200" end="00:51:37.920" style="s2">it&#39;s okay but it&#39;s slow and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.280" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.920" end="00:51:41.520" style="s2">and there wasn&#39;t a lot of it it was more</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">just the articles that</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.520" end="00:51:45.599" style="s2">were written and even the newer ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.920" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">were like it&#39;s meant for prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.599" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">it&#39;s meant for really quick stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:50.800" style="s2">that i guess that&#39;s not to say it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:53.839" style="s2">only one</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.800" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">that&#39;s good for that um</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.839" end="00:52:00.000" style="s2">so as long as firebase now</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">i guess it sounds like firebase so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.000" end="00:52:05.920" style="s2">the database and automatic api</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:08.000" style="s2">and hosting and scheduling an</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.920" end="00:52:10.079" style="s2">authentication authorization</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.000" end="00:52:11.760" style="s2">okay and then you can sort of tack on</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.079" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">any extra back-end stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.760" end="00:52:17.040" style="s2">you need as well yeah so it has</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">they would be they they use serverless</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.040" end="00:52:19.920" style="s2">functions</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:21.359" style="s2">so you can write some code and that code</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.920" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">will be available to be run</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.359" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">and called from the front end at any</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:26.160" style="s2">time right</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">how does being serverless work with a</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.160" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">database</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">serverless is just a place so like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">know normally you have an application</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">server</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">and then you have a database server it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:41.200" style="s2">the application server except it runs on</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">any one of a thousand computers</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.200" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">and it runs is that running on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:49.359" style="s2">client side and then it&#39;s just all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:51.599" style="s2">clients are doing direct</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.359" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">connections when they say serverless it</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.599" end="00:52:55.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a server it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">means it&#39;s someone else&#39;s server</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.599" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;re using a cloud server right so</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:02.240" style="s2">your code is running on one of 20</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">machines</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:05.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s running on a server i see like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">in any well</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.280" end="00:53:10.079" style="s2">like on ews or netlify or any of those</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:12.000" style="s2">types of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.079" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">okay now in this case if you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.000" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">firebase it will be run at google</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:17.359" style="s2">because firebase is a google product</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:18.960" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s just the product that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.359" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">that i they were one of the first to</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.960" end="00:53:23.359" style="s2">kind of come out with that</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:24.160" style="s2">now there&#39;s an azure version aws really</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.359" end="00:53:27.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.160" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">a good one and i&#39;m actually so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.520" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">switching over to mongodb</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:34.000" style="s2">but it it has it follows a lot closer to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">the philosophy than</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.000" end="00:53:37.280" style="s2">than ruby on rails to firebase longer to</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.280" end="00:53:40.640" style="s2">closer to firebase right because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.640" end="00:53:45.760" style="s2">serverless functions and stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">okay cool so i guess because i started</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.760" end="00:53:53.040" style="s2">to work on the like</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.319" style="s2">the listing out all the features of just</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.040" end="00:53:57.520" style="s2">confronting itself like</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.319" end="00:53:59.599" style="s2">regardless if we&#39;re going ruby or</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.520" end="00:54:01.359" style="s2">or firebase or whatever and that got</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.599" end="00:54:02.880" style="s2">like big fast</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.359" end="00:54:04.960" style="s2">so first i&#39;m like okay let&#39;s just take a</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.880" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">step back and try to figure out like</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:10.079" style="s2">which of the because a part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:11.520" style="s2">well your requirements shouldn&#39;t i mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.079" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">requirements shouldn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.520" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:16.480" style="s2">right in them right yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">but i think</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.480" end="00:54:20.960" style="s2">a part of it is if there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">okay i want these features</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.960" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">okay well if we&#39;re going with with rails</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">then the</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.559" end="00:54:28.720" style="s2">the main idea is to use existing gems</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">and so a part of it is you&#39;re restricted</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.720" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">based on what gems there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:35.599" style="s2">um and you can do custom development but</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:36.799" style="s2">if you go heavy down that road then what</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.599" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">was the point in using rails in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.799" end="00:54:39.839" style="s2">first place</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:44.160" style="s2">yeah yeah i mean um</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.240" end="00:54:52.480" style="s2">i mean rails could do</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">anything firebase can</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.480" end="00:54:56.400" style="s2">uh because they&#39;re both general purpose</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">language right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.400" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">it just sounds like the custom</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:06.160" style="s2">might be a bit more arduous in rails</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.440" style="s2">is that well no i mean it would be for</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.160" end="00:55:08.720" style="s2">me because i don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.440" end="00:55:11.839" style="s2">but if you ever if you have a if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.720" end="00:55:13.760" style="s2">have a skilled rails dev at a skilled</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.839" end="00:55:15.839" style="s2">it might be a little bit because rails</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.760" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include the database</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.839" end="00:55:19.040" style="s2">well it kind of does because i think you</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">could write that</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.040" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember now which way rails</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.960" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">goes i guess it may actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">when you write the ruby code it may</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">generate the database</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.200" end="00:55:33.280" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m not sure i would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.880" end="00:55:34.880" style="s2">there&#39;s probably a ton of gems to help</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.280" end="00:55:36.000" style="s2">handle that so you can pick like what</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.880" end="00:55:37.680" style="s2">kind of database you&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.000" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">here&#39;s library of gems too</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.680" end="00:55:41.359" style="s2">that&#39;s they&#39;re so they&#39;re tech that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:43.040" style="s2">the active record tech</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.359" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">that they&#39;re listing out there and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.040" end="00:55:44.880" style="s2">just don&#39;t remember what their active</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:48.400" style="s2">record</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.880" end="00:55:50.319" style="s2">is which way it goes um right now</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.400" end="00:55:52.240" style="s2">i see okay i wrote a little bit of it</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.319" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">some of the stuff you you write the code</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.240" end="00:55:55.040" style="s2">and it builds the database so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:55:56.880" style="s2">have to worry about the database and</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.040" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">somebody you write the database and it</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.880" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">builds some code</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:03.040" style="s2">right um either way it&#39;s a it&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:06.079" style="s2">where you only have to write half of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.040" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">um okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.079" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">all right yeah i mean it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:12.720" style="s2">then i don&#39;t need to go rails if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:15.040" style="s2">already these collections out there</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.720" end="00:56:16.000" style="s2">um i might go and shop around and see if</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.040" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">i can find a similar</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.000" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">article for firebase just to see what</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:23.040" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">things are for that um it i wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.040" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">much attached to</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">particular gems more just the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:30.240" style="s2">hey here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">collection of features that we can build</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.240" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">out relatively easily</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">to you know a from scratch project</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">um but if firebase can do that too then</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.640" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">it&#39;s just that&#39;s all i actually care</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:47.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s really hard to compare</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.760" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">right i guess i kind of like that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.760" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">firebase is newer</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">because that means that the information</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll find out there is more look more</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:57.680" style="s2">likely to be current because that was</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">definitely a problem as i was going</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.680" end="00:56:59.920" style="s2">through articles i&#39;m like oh this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:02.319" style="s2">neat oh that&#39;s four years old</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.920" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">okay no i i don&#39;t care about the article</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.319" end="00:57:05.359" style="s2">well i mean they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve made some significant changes to</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.359" end="00:57:11.359" style="s2">firebase so you get some of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.040" end="00:57:13.200" style="s2">um but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.359" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">yeah yeah i don&#39;t know i mean in the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.200" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">i think whenever</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:16.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s shown that any</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">tech stack is significantly faster to</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:31.520" style="s2">develop in</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.839" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">um like a full stack right</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.520" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">so it really comes down to what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.920" style="s2">your devs now</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:39.680" style="s2">it&#39;s usually the deciding factor unless</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.920" end="00:57:41.119" style="s2">you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.680" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">something really simple and then you</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.119" end="00:57:46.000" style="s2">should go with squarespace right</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:47.920" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t have any custom</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.000" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">functionality then you don&#39;t even need a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.920" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">developer</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.280" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">but if you need a developer then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">probably more driven by their stack</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">right i don&#39;t know yeah i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:58:01.200" style="s2">any of the stacks are</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:03.599" style="s2">significantly faster okay um</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:04.880" style="s2">and then like the firebase react</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">whatever stack that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.880" end="00:58:08.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a fairly popular one that like</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">there will be a decent number of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.880" end="00:58:12.160" style="s2">det developers that can work in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.200" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.160" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">yeah okay yeah i mean it&#39;s not so react</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.200" end="00:58:18.559" style="s2">being the front end there&#39;ll be a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">devs doing that that is the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.559" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">front end</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">i think firebase is the back end will</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">narrow down the people but most anyone</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:29.040" style="s2">can learn it</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not right it&#39;s not a whole it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.040" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">big enough one that they wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.400" end="00:58:32.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">and it sort of seems to be gaining</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.960" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">popularity from what i can tell so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:37.040" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:38.960" style="s2">actually yeah and actually the like it</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.040" end="00:58:39.599" style="s2">uses a lot of serverless functions and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.960" end="00:58:42.720" style="s2">that same</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.599" end="00:58:44.799" style="s2">technology if you know it it it</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.720" end="00:58:47.920" style="s2">basically applies to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.799" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">to azure microsoft azure as well and</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">mongodb so they all use that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">tech</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">it&#39;s less specific the only times you</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:58.480" style="s2">get into really specific stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">is the identity and authorization but</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.480" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">actually that</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:03.280" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly plug and play so okay yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.280" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">um you&#39;d either be able to find people</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:10.240" style="s2">or they would be able to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">pretty quickly right and it&#39;s a popular</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.240" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">technology so they wouldn&#39;t be wasting</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">their time by learning it which is good</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">right yeah cool okay nice yeah i&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">a look around but that definitely sounds</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.880" end="00:59:24.240" style="s2">better from what i was reading because</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:25.680" style="s2">like they kept mentioning prototypes but</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.240" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.680" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">they also sort of like yeah the general</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:33.920" style="s2">vibe i got is that not a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:37.920" style="s2">developers take rails terribly seriously</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.920" end="00:59:39.680" style="s2">well yeah yeah i haven&#39;t heard about it</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.920" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">a lot except from you in the last year</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.680" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">or two but</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:44.319" style="s2">i did some reading it sounds like they</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:48.000" style="s2">were coming out with</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.319" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">ruby 3.0 and like that just in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.000" end="00:59:53.920" style="s2">group of people yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">i i mean that&#39;s a part of what i was</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.920" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">sort of wondering is like</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.240" style="s2">is it good but like you have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">ruby developer and know the gems and</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.240" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">know this and like oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been working on it here&#39;s the gems</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">used to create this sweet stack</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.720" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">but then it&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">like yeah it&#39;s a sweet stack you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.799" style="s2">yeah i could</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.839" end="01:00:10.559" style="s2">create that in firebase and now you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.799" end="01:00:12.400" style="s2">using old tech and you&#39;re limited in</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.559" end="01:00:14.480" style="s2">the developers and so on so i mean the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.400" end="01:00:16.880" style="s2">system that has the most plug-ins is</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.480" end="01:00:21.040" style="s2">wordpress</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.880" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">so if you want the quickest prototype</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.040" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">wordpress is it uh all right i gotta let</p>
