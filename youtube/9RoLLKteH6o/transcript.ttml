<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:03.270" style="s2">coming back to protein and amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.730" end="00:00:04.950" style="s2">for a minute</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.270" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">so amino acids are the building block of</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.950" end="00:00:08.760" style="s2">protein they are foundational for making</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:10.320" style="s2">neurotransmitters are also foundational</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.760" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">for making just structure everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.320" end="00:00:15.059" style="s2">including neural tissue structure as far</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:17.160" style="s2">as foundations go because we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.059" end="00:00:19.410" style="s2">supplement right and so like obviously</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.160" end="00:00:22.289" style="s2">for for dopamine&#39;s and catecholamines is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.410" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">why we have the the DL PA and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.289" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">n-acetyl tyrosine and quality of it but</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:31.050" style="s2">to just have foundational amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:34.940" style="s2">sufficiency what are some key things</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:36.780" style="s2">people can do well I mean truly</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.940" end="00:00:38.280" style="s2">supplementation if you&#39;re not taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.780" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">complete proteins in the diet and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.280" end="00:00:42.300" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the key I mean first</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:44.480" style="s2">and foremost take complete proteins in</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.300" end="00:00:48.750" style="s2">the diet I mean you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.480" end="00:00:51.590" style="s2">proteins that are more complete would be</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.750" end="00:00:58.199" style="s2">things like a whey protein concentrate</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.590" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">or a egg protein you can get complete</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.199" end="00:01:03.480" style="s2">proteins with vegetable sources but they</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.000" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">usually have to have added pieces to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.480" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">them so you have to have quite a variety</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">of vegetables to get all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:13.549" style="s2">essential amino acids in there because</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">vegetables are notorious for missing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.549" end="00:01:19.049" style="s2">certain essential pieces but if you mix</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:22.759" style="s2">it up really well and you&#39;ve mean it</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:26.729" style="s2">really takes some good planning as a nun</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.759" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">as an vegetarian or a vegan has to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.729" end="00:01:31.979" style="s2">really plan well with the vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:34.590" style="s2">that they take throughout a day so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.979" end="00:01:38.070" style="s2">they can create that complete mix of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:40.920" style="s2">these essential amino acids or they will</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.070" end="00:01:42.810" style="s2">be missing certain ones like missing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.920" end="00:01:44.790" style="s2">nails for the house I mean you know you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.810" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">can have all this this great material to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.790" end="00:01:48.659" style="s2">build the house but without those nails</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to have a solid solid</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.659" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">structure and they that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.610" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">in the body when you&#39;re missing one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:58.380" style="s2">those one of those key pieces and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.780" style="s2">know tyrosine Tiger seems a big one and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.380" end="00:02:03.270" style="s2">you know there&#39;s not really much</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.780" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">toxicity with amino acids I mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.270" end="00:02:08.700" style="s2">have the body will tend to take the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">amino acids in through gluconeogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.700" end="00:02:12.270" style="s2">it&#39;ll actually create carbohydrates out</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:15.480" style="s2">of them so it&#39;ll just break</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.270" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">down if you have an excess of the amino</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.480" end="00:02:19.950" style="s2">acid so you&#39;re not really at risk for</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:22.170" style="s2">getting excess but it&#39;s very common to</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.950" end="00:02:24.150" style="s2">get deficiencies in the amino acids and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.170" end="00:02:25.980" style="s2">that&#39;s why supplementing with with the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.150" end="00:02:29.130" style="s2">amino acids either in a protein powder</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.980" end="00:02:30.930" style="s2">or in a supplement that&#39;s very directed</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.130" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">at the mix that&#39;s required for the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.930" end="00:02:35.400" style="s2">like qualia gives you that baseline that</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">at least keeps you above that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.400" end="00:02:40.260" style="s2">deficiency threshold so are there any</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:42.840" style="s2">particular protein that you suggest</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.260" end="00:02:48.270" style="s2">people avoid or that they might want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.840" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">avoid you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t prefer</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.270" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">the soy proteins and I know this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:55.380" style="s2">going to gain me any favors in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:58.050" style="s2">vegetarian community but you know i the</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.380" end="00:03:00.050" style="s2">the soy proteins so I just it contains</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.050" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">too many things that are potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.050" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">toxic to the body I mean you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:11.840" style="s2">about the electing contents you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">talking about the the the serves the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.840" end="00:03:16.380" style="s2">estrogen receptor modifiers those kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:18.990" style="s2">of things which I&#39;ve seen some very</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.380" end="00:03:20.850" style="s2">negative impacts from those and and you</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.990" end="00:03:22.770" style="s2">know the argument goes both ways I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.850" end="00:03:24.810" style="s2">you talk about red meat and you talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.770" end="00:03:26.730" style="s2">about the carcinogens and the toxicities</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.810" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">that are associated with that so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.730" end="00:03:31.290" style="s2">always a balancing act between these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:35.550" style="s2">and you know I I kind of fall in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.290" end="00:03:38.330" style="s2">mid-range where I like the eggs and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.550" end="00:03:42.450" style="s2">seafood as my primary protein sources</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.330" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">they give a pretty complete mix with</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.450" end="00:03:47.820" style="s2">those but when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:50.820" style="s2">dealing with specialty diets that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.820" end="00:03:52.830" style="s2">not really conducive to the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.820" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">physiology they&#39;re not ideal for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.830" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">human physiology you&#39;re gonna have to to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:02.190" style="s2">get some of those base nutrients from</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:03.990" style="s2">somewhere else and you know with when</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.190" end="00:04:06.360" style="s2">I&#39;m when I have and I have quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.990" end="00:04:08.820" style="s2">vegetarian clients when I&#39;m with them</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.360" end="00:04:10.380" style="s2">though I actually set up their regimen</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.820" end="00:04:13.590" style="s2">based on what their primary foods</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.380" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">intakes are so I do end up supplementing</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.590" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">them a little bit more with with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:20.130" style="s2">other end of the spectrum and the Paleo</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:22.740" style="s2">and add in style eaters I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.130" end="00:04:25.290" style="s2">dealing more with mitigating toxicities</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.740" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">and inflammation so you know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.290" end="00:04:27.840" style="s2">have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:31.230" style="s2">it&#39;s not like ok well there&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.840" end="00:04:33.900" style="s2">diet the that is ideal you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.230" end="00:04:36.030" style="s2">balance that between the individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.900" end="00:04:38.220" style="s2">preferences that people have now for</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">people who are wanting to kind of dial</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.220" end="00:04:42.570" style="s2">it in more and know if a diet they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:45.300" style="s2">is really working well for them do you</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.570" end="00:04:47.010" style="s2">do amino acid testing so you know of</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.300" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">amino acids or something like that to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.010" end="00:04:53.130" style="s2">get a sense of where people&#39;s amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:56.250" style="s2">profile is you know I used to do those</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.130" end="00:04:58.140" style="s2">and just you know the amino acids I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.250" end="00:05:01.050" style="s2">unless you&#39;re looking at a glaring</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.140" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">deficiency on those tests it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.050" end="00:05:04.350" style="s2">that helpful I mean you know the meal</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.200" style="s2">you had the night before is really going</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.350" end="00:05:11.130" style="s2">to affect what what you&#39;re seeing in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.200" end="00:05:15.240" style="s2">blood is just the test by itself looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.130" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">at adequacy it&#39;s it was more of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.240" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">looking at the history and the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:21.990" style="s2">current lifestyle habits oh man I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.830" end="00:05:25.440" style="s2">rather have people document their food</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.990" end="00:05:27.900" style="s2">intake for for two weeks then spend the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:31.980" style="s2">money on an amino acid test in general I</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.900" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">mean and resorting regarding sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.980" end="00:05:37.470" style="s2">with with protein for different body</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:39.990" style="s2">types so how I mean there are obviously</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.470" end="00:05:42.420" style="s2">some people who went vegan felt healthy</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.990" end="00:05:44.010" style="s2">for a while and then started feeling</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.420" end="00:05:45.540" style="s2">like they ran into some challenges other</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.010" end="00:05:47.370" style="s2">people felt less healthy right away</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.540" end="00:05:50.820" style="s2">other people felt healthy healthier</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.370" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">enduringly so there&#39;s obviously genetics</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.820" end="00:05:54.090" style="s2">and there&#39;s obviously how someone does</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">it there&#39;s also genetics that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.090" end="00:06:01.230" style="s2">involved and other physiologic factors</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:03.510" style="s2">that are involved speak to that well the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.230" end="00:06:05.910" style="s2">first first thing I note with most</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.510" end="00:06:08.910" style="s2">people they go in the vegetarian diet is</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.910" end="00:06:11.100" style="s2">that they generally thrive initially I</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.910" end="00:06:12.870" style="s2">mean they&#39;re they&#39;re all about it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.100" end="00:06:14.790" style="s2">and a lot of it has to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.870" end="00:06:17.910" style="s2">calorie restriction I mean that low</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.790" end="00:06:20.130" style="s2">calorie intake is pretty common with a</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.910" end="00:06:22.770" style="s2">vegetarian diet and people feel really</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.130" end="00:06:24.120" style="s2">good on that they also feel good because</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.770" end="00:06:25.260" style="s2">we&#39;re getting rid of some toxicities</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.120" end="00:06:27.120" style="s2">that they&#39;re going to get from the meats</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.260" end="00:06:31.320" style="s2">but vegetables have their own sets of</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.120" end="00:06:32.970" style="s2">toxins as well what I find is and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.320" end="00:06:36.810" style="s2">goes back to that triage theory of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.970" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">micronutrients is it&#39;s not a complete</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.810" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">diet I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:42.130" style="s2">you know we&#39;re omnivores by physiology</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:44.590" style="s2">and we require certain nutrients and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.130" end="00:06:46.150" style="s2">you can you can do well you can thrive</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.590" end="00:06:47.770" style="s2">for a long time on the vegetarian diet</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.150" end="00:06:49.330" style="s2">if you&#39;re monitoring those</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.770" end="00:06:51.970" style="s2">micronutrients and making sure you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.330" end="00:06:55.390" style="s2">supplementing the risks for deficiencies</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.970" end="00:06:57.580" style="s2">but what happens is over time and and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.390" end="00:06:59.200" style="s2">may take 1012 years of being on the diet</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.580" end="00:07:01.810" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people that want 15 years</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.200" end="00:07:03.850" style="s2">before their health really collapsed but</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.810" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">that triage theory is that background</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.850" end="00:07:09.420" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s really required for</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:13.900" style="s2">long-term health and optimal thriving</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.420" end="00:07:17.320" style="s2">gets gets put on the back backburner and</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.900" end="00:07:18.910" style="s2">just does not not function well so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.320" end="00:07:21.040" style="s2">overt stuff that you&#39;re gonna pay</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.910" end="00:07:23.170" style="s2">attention to you&#39;re gonna feel that and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.040" end="00:07:24.940" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna you&#39;re gonna see that but</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.170" end="00:07:27.850" style="s2">you&#39;re not really paying attention to</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.940" end="00:07:30.760" style="s2">that that deep stuff that is all about</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.850" end="00:07:32.230" style="s2">long-term thriving and like I said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.760" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">not that you shouldn&#39;t do it it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.230" end="00:07:36.850" style="s2">more of really paying attention to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:39.760" style="s2">fact that this is going on and making</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.850" end="00:07:46.480" style="s2">sure you&#39;re doing things to to mitigate</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.760" end="00:07:48.730" style="s2">that that potential outcome so just to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.480" end="00:07:53.140" style="s2">clarify wrap up a few things for people</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.730" end="00:07:55.390" style="s2">so in a essential amino acid is an amino</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.140" end="00:07:57.250" style="s2">acid we have to get from food other</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.390" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">amino acids or ones that our body can</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.250" end="00:08:01.960" style="s2">create from the essential amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:04.150" style="s2">complete protein contains all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.960" end="00:08:06.580" style="s2">essential amino acids eight of them but</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.150" end="00:08:09.160" style="s2">our body has 23 or so primary amino</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.580" end="00:08:12.880" style="s2">acids that are involved some proteins</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.160" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">like eggs have kind of all 23 or most of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.880" end="00:08:16.360" style="s2">them because it&#39;s everything necessary</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:18.880" style="s2">to make a little creature right and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.360" end="00:08:21.370" style="s2">it has a particularly easy time</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.880" end="00:08:22.750" style="s2">providing all the amino acids if the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:24.460" style="s2">body&#39;s having a hard time converting</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.750" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">them for other deficiency reasons which</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.460" end="00:08:29.520" style="s2">is why some people do particularly well</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:32.680" style="s2">with those like beyond complete proteins</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.520" end="00:08:33.849" style="s2">most plants they all have amino acids</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.680" end="00:08:36.520" style="s2">but they don&#39;t necessarily have all</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.849" end="00:08:37.930" style="s2">eight essential amino acids most of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.520" end="00:08:40.360" style="s2">time they don&#39;t so if you get a wide</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.930" end="00:08:42.789" style="s2">variety of different legumes beans nuts</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.360" end="00:08:45.190" style="s2">seeds greens you&#39;re gonna get different</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.789" end="00:08:46.890" style="s2">amino acid profiles from each so where</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.190" end="00:08:50.170" style="s2">people are getting amino acids from food</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.890" end="00:08:51.150" style="s2">pretty wide variety is relevant the few</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.170" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">plant source</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.150" end="00:08:55.260" style="s2">of complete proteins if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:57.720" style="s2">taking extracts like a brown rice</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.260" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">protein which represents 1 or 2 percent</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.720" end="00:09:03.180" style="s2">of the total brown rice the allergies</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.590" style="s2">are a particularly unique source I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.180" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">is worth mentioning if people do</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.590" end="00:09:09.150" style="s2">spirulina chlorella blue-green algae</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:12.530" style="s2">they&#39;re just kind of micronutrient dense</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.150" end="00:09:15.630" style="s2">across so many categories detox and yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.530" end="00:09:18.150" style="s2">they have much more than that even I</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.630" end="00:09:21.030" style="s2">mean that those are awesome yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.150" end="00:09:23.940" style="s2">just supplement so I do know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.030" end="00:09:26.580" style="s2">people who are doing kind of vegetarian</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.940" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">vegan super food oriented diets algie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.580" end="00:09:30.300" style="s2">bee pollen things that are very nutrient</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">dense and amino acid dense are something</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.300" end="00:09:36.150" style="s2">they oftentimes supplement as a food</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">source with if someone wants to learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.150" end="00:09:40.350" style="s2">more about protein and amino acids and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:41.970" style="s2">getting enough amino acids on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.350" end="00:09:44.520" style="s2">plant-based diet I&#39;ll just recommend</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.970" end="00:09:46.860" style="s2">real quick I think there&#39;s a website</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.520" end="00:09:49.290" style="s2">called vegan bodybuilding comm that has</p>
