<p begin="00:00:13.250" end="00:00:18.650" style="s2">to this interview because I watched your</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.980" end="00:00:19.849" style="s2">film in shadow and if people are</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.650" end="00:00:21.919" style="s2">watching this and haven&#39;t seen it I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.849" end="00:00:23.480" style="s2">really highly recommend I will put the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.919" end="00:00:24.800" style="s2">link in the show notes for this and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.480" end="00:00:27.680" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna probably show some of it on</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.800" end="00:00:30.050" style="s2">the screen as we&#39;re talking and what I</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.680" end="00:00:32.390" style="s2">was really struck by was the the depth</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.050" end="00:00:34.850" style="s2">and the breadth of your like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.390" end="00:00:38.510" style="s2">really ambitious project it really kind</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.850" end="00:00:39.860" style="s2">of shows what I&#39;d say that the prisons</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.510" end="00:00:42.170" style="s2">that we&#39;ve made for ourselves and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.860" end="00:00:45.350" style="s2">various traps of kind of modern society</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.170" end="00:00:47.750" style="s2">and there is a hopeful kind of ending to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.350" end="00:00:49.039" style="s2">it but I was really struck by just the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.750" end="00:00:50.420" style="s2">depth and the breadth of the vision</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.039" end="00:00:54.079" style="s2">which is something I&#39;ve not seen many</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.420" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2">artworks 1/10 let alone pull off in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.079" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">way that you managed he managed it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.000" end="00:01:00.199" style="s2">the first thing to say would be but what</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.399" end="00:01:01.940" style="s2">does the film show what&#39;s the trajectory</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.199" end="00:01:03.410" style="s2">of the film and what how would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.940" end="00:01:05.239" style="s2">describe it to someone who hasn&#39;t seen</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.410" end="00:01:07.670" style="s2">it it is a journey through the</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.239" end="00:01:10.910" style="s2">unconscious the fractured unconscious of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.670" end="00:01:13.369" style="s2">our cultural psyche at least in the West</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.910" end="00:01:17.690" style="s2">but I know that it permeates world</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.369" end="00:01:20.050" style="s2">culture overall and that being the in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.690" end="00:01:24.080" style="s2">way sleepwalking through life</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.050" end="00:01:27.860" style="s2">sleepwalking through narratives you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.080" end="00:01:29.140" style="s2">that we are we we are we&#39;re subservient</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.860" end="00:01:32.270" style="s2">to but we also</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.140" end="00:01:35.539" style="s2">bow down to we we are complicit to these</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.270" end="00:01:37.700" style="s2">narratives and we function in a whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.539" end="00:01:38.660" style="s2">bunch of circuits and programs that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.700" end="00:01:41.929" style="s2">not of our choosing</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.660" end="00:01:45.349" style="s2">and I argue that there if one is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.929" end="00:01:47.599" style="s2">consciously aware of their actions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.349" end="00:01:51.349" style="s2">their motivations they are running</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.599" end="00:01:53.690" style="s2">closed circuits predictable and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.349" end="00:01:56.660" style="s2">ultimately unsatisfying and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.690" end="00:01:59.500" style="s2">for us all so it&#39;s a journey through</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.660" end="00:02:02.119" style="s2">that and of course it&#39;s it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.500" end="00:02:07.789" style="s2">eventual and inevitable in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.119" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">mm-hmm and maybe we&#39;ll see that soon the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.789" end="00:02:12.440" style="s2">inevitable breakdown of the illusions</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:16.250" style="s2">for those who have the fortitude and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.440" end="00:02:16.700" style="s2">courage to rewire their reality map of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.250" end="00:02:21.470" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.700" end="00:02:23.800" style="s2">and the the consequent infusion what</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.470" end="00:02:27.550" style="s2">something rate or something transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.800" end="00:02:31.849" style="s2">which is here for us at all times</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.550" end="00:02:35.870" style="s2">embodying that and renewing renewing</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.849" end="00:02:37.280" style="s2">this realm and renewing our culture yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.870" end="00:02:39.890" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s so many questions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.280" end="00:02:41.300" style="s2">looking forward to asking you and when I</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.890" end="00:02:43.190" style="s2">was going to talk about later on but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.300" end="00:02:45.620" style="s2">feel like I&#39;m gonna ask it now is</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.190" end="00:02:49.310" style="s2">because I&#39;ve watched the film like more</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.620" end="00:02:52.220" style="s2">than once and it&#39;s very intense</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.310" end="00:02:54.440" style="s2">there is this this sort of as you say</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.220" end="00:02:56.120" style="s2">kind of hopeful transcendent ending to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.440" end="00:02:58.130" style="s2">it but it almost feels like an</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.120" end="00:03:00.380" style="s2">afterthought like it&#39;s so relentless the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.130" end="00:03:03.590" style="s2">first sort of part of the film</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.380" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">do you and can you explain that like</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.590" end="00:03:07.610" style="s2">what is what is the hopeful end to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:10.180" style="s2">after this sort of really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.610" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">relentless and quite dystopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.180" end="00:03:15.980" style="s2">earlier in the film yeah very good</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:17.930" style="s2">question and it&#39;s a probably the most</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.980" end="00:03:20.870" style="s2">difficult question to answer and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.930" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">leave it till the end of your that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.870" end="00:03:23.810" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:25.250" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it is the most difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.810" end="00:03:27.609" style="s2">question to answer only because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.250" end="00:03:30.650" style="s2">so much so much of the vernacular</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.609" end="00:03:32.239" style="s2">connected to this process of awakening</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.650" end="00:03:36.829" style="s2">can be there</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.239" end="00:03:38.600" style="s2">UAG or cliched or maybe too intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.829" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s a fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.600" end="00:03:45.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tightrope to walk but in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:48.140" style="s2">way it&#39;s it&#39;s within I think your field</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.350" end="00:03:50.329" style="s2">of inquiry and I think Jordan house in</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.140" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">terms of sovereignty probably applies</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.329" end="00:03:54.950" style="s2">very very strongly to this and not</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">probably it does apply very strongly to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.950" end="00:03:59.299" style="s2">the sovereignty meaning cutting the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:01.819" style="s2">strings of influence those are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.299" end="00:04:05.329" style="s2">influence of our own psyche of our own</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.819" end="00:04:08.709" style="s2">upbringing of our programming the coping</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.329" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">patterns mechanisms that we&#39;ve inherited</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.709" end="00:04:15.290" style="s2">that we have taken on as</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:16.880" style="s2">protected by you know the the child to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.290" end="00:04:19.220" style="s2">though child growing up and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.880" end="00:04:21.220" style="s2">whatever circumstances represent that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.220" end="00:04:24.530" style="s2">consequently become in the social mask</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.220" end="00:04:27.830" style="s2">that being confused for the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.530" end="00:04:30.320" style="s2">the self and the social mask is ten and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.830" end="00:04:32.870" style="s2">in constant competition with the outside</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.320" end="00:04:35.210" style="s2">world and costs the protection and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.870" end="00:04:38.300" style="s2">constant enhancement the curation of its</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.210" end="00:04:39.680" style="s2">image and I listened he did a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.300" end="00:04:41.930" style="s2">interesting interview with a mutual</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.680" end="00:04:44.510" style="s2">friend of ours Peter Lindbergh where you</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.930" end="00:04:47.750" style="s2">talked about some of this the symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.510" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">and the imagery in the film and one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.750" end="00:04:50.990" style="s2">that you talked about kind of waking up</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.180" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t really realize until</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.990" end="00:04:54.950" style="s2">listening to that interview with Peter</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.180" end="00:04:56.840" style="s2">that everyone has their eyes closed</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.950" end="00:04:59.030" style="s2">throughout the film right up until the</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.840" end="00:05:01.490" style="s2">end could you describe some of the sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.030" end="00:05:04.190" style="s2">of specific imagery that you use and</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.490" end="00:05:06.500" style="s2">what it represents in the film yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.190" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">there overall the film was a fine line</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.500" end="00:05:10.760" style="s2">between being accessible enough to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:12.530" style="s2">general audience because I didn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.760" end="00:05:16.820" style="s2">to preach to the choir and also</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.530" end="00:05:18.200" style="s2">calibrating it for for for truth in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.820" end="00:05:20.210" style="s2">way without beating people over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.200" end="00:05:22.220" style="s2">heads you know some of the symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.210" end="00:05:24.200" style="s2">values the symbols are young to suits</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.220" end="00:05:26.870" style="s2">that&#39;s a cliche way of expressing a</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.200" end="00:05:29.720" style="s2">certain certain type of occupation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.870" end="00:05:31.970" style="s2">our world so I wish I had found a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.720" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">elegant way to to describe that but</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.970" end="00:05:35.479" style="s2">other symbols are yes the eye is being</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.160" end="00:05:37.610" style="s2">closed then I think that works</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.479" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">subconsciously on the psyche of going</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.610" end="00:05:41.150" style="s2">through all these individuals who are</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:43.430" style="s2">whose guys are either and in shadow</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.150" end="00:05:46.280" style="s2">presumably closed or are actually closed</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.430" end="00:05:49.850" style="s2">and the impact at the end of the film</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.280" end="00:05:52.400" style="s2">the mind the two eyes open that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.850" end="00:05:55.190" style="s2">profound to some viewers other symbols</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">are you know the cube the red cube the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.190" end="00:06:03.370" style="s2">six sided cube some some people have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:05.860" style="s2">noted there are many synchronistic</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.370" end="00:06:10.729" style="s2">alignments to that 6iq</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.860" end="00:06:13.070" style="s2">it&#39;s that the mask as well the dark</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.729" end="00:06:16.370" style="s2">clouds the dark gunk coming out of some</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.070" end="00:06:18.169" style="s2">individuals yeah so I guess I can start</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.370" end="00:06:19.760" style="s2">with the cube and the cube in a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.169" end="00:06:21.880" style="s2">broad broad way</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.760" end="00:06:25.490" style="s2">speaking as narratives and</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.880" end="00:06:27.920" style="s2">interpretations of events of our reality</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.490" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">of a way of being in this world can in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.920" end="00:06:31.730" style="s2">my opinion be traced and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:34.550" style="s2">strong argument to be made that many</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.730" end="00:06:37.190" style="s2">narratives are manufactured to what end</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.550" end="00:06:40.580" style="s2">sometimes we can guess other times we</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.190" end="00:06:43.160" style="s2">know to what end the cube itself is a it</p>

<p begin="00:06:48.470" end="00:06:54.140" style="s2">filtered through that cubes structure</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.710" end="00:06:57.020" style="s2">and so that&#39;s all we receive and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.140" end="00:07:00.670" style="s2">all we that&#39;s how we act in the world</p>

<p begin="00:07:00.670" end="00:07:06.250" style="s2">simply saying defining that and then the</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:10.460" style="s2">mask of course is the social persona</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.250" end="00:07:12.020" style="s2">it&#39;s the it&#39;s as I mentioned earlier</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.460" end="00:07:14.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.020" end="00:07:17.120" style="s2">constructed as a way to buffer the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.870" end="00:07:19.250" style="s2">anxiety of the world the threat of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.120" end="00:07:22.160" style="s2">world and our misconceptions about it</p>

<p begin="00:07:45.170" end="00:07:52.610" style="s2">and our true self many times that lower</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.970" end="00:08:02.000" style="s2">all kinds of things that can be masked</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.550" end="00:08:04.340" style="s2">by a well curated image and this well</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.000" end="00:08:07.870" style="s2">curated image can and there&#39;s a scene in</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.340" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">the film in a way which this couple</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.870" end="00:08:13.460" style="s2">advertises this on a screen advertises</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:16.700" style="s2">the mask it comes out to the first first</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.460" end="00:08:19.540" style="s2">man it&#39;s there are many types of masks</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.700" end="00:08:21.970" style="s2">that that are advertised you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.540" end="00:08:25.270" style="s2">whether it&#39;s intentional or not they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.970" end="00:08:28.970" style="s2">and those masks are available for our</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.270" end="00:08:29.940" style="s2">purchase so to speak embodying those</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.970" end="00:08:33.090" style="s2">masks</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.940" end="00:08:35.370" style="s2">and there are they&#39;re extremely limiting</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.090" end="00:08:38.039" style="s2">because they&#39;re closed circuits they</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.370" end="00:08:40.830" style="s2">allow certain types of behavior and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.039" end="00:08:43.770" style="s2">require a certain kind of feedback they</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.830" end="00:08:46.380" style="s2">seek success and that successes am i</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.770" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">validated and they constantly need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.380" end="00:08:49.830" style="s2">fed and the other thing that comes to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.290" style="s2">mind there are that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">other symbolism but the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.290" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a running theme is the dark sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:09:01.230" style="s2">of cloud that comes through the bodies</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:03.450" style="s2">and all of these images were were</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.230" end="00:09:08.400" style="s2">designed in a way to evoke feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.450" end="00:09:10.500" style="s2">emotions and so the dark cloud itself is</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.400" end="00:09:13.260" style="s2">just that it came from my own feeling</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.500" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">emotions of observing and feeling myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.260" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">and feeling doubting others and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:21.630" style="s2">almost as disrupt this purification of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:24.450" style="s2">in a repression of disowning the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.630" end="00:09:26.310" style="s2">the summoning that which is deformed it</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.450" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work which really is crying out</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.310" end="00:09:32.580" style="s2">to be untangled and then brought to bite</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:34.740" style="s2">so that health vitality and life can</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.580" end="00:09:38.730" style="s2">truly flow through and create higher</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.740" end="00:09:41.220" style="s2">order so that that dark gunk is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.730" end="00:09:43.530" style="s2">purification of all that and it it just</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.220" end="00:09:45.480" style="s2">indicates heavy suppression of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.530" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">have your own consciousness obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.480" end="00:09:50.250" style="s2">the title refers is called in shadow and</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:51.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a term that maybe people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.250" end="00:09:54.270" style="s2">familiar with from Jungian psychology</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.780" end="00:09:55.710" style="s2">which shadow being all the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.270" end="00:09:58.980" style="s2">ourselves that we don&#39;t that we reject</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.710" end="00:10:00.450" style="s2">or we don&#39;t integrate is that a you is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.980" end="00:10:02.220" style="s2">that where it comes from for you is it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.450" end="00:10:04.080" style="s2">kind of Jungian reference</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.220" end="00:10:06.120" style="s2">it&#39;s a Jungian reference but it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.080" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">come from that originally it&#39;s it just</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.120" end="00:10:12.810" style="s2">came from Jung tapped into some a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.660" style="s2">reality right and then he defined it for</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.810" end="00:10:18.780" style="s2">us in the 20th century and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.660" end="00:10:21.210" style="s2">great great a very apt metaphor but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.780" end="00:10:23.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t originally come from Jung though</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.210" end="00:10:26.670" style="s2">I love you and I&#39;m very inspired by many</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.310" end="00:10:29.940" style="s2">of his articulations of reality and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.670" end="00:10:34.230" style="s2">way he frames much of the archaic wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.940" end="00:10:35.339" style="s2">and the conscious adventure of become of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.230" end="00:10:37.980" style="s2">becoming conscious from our</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.339" end="00:10:40.020" style="s2">consciousness is it&#39;s it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.980" end="00:10:42.810" style="s2">it&#39;s a slow process</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.020" end="00:10:44.850" style="s2">of shining light on things and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.810" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">integrating them can be very</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.850" end="00:10:53.190" style="s2">uncomfortable and so the shadow is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:55.080" style="s2">really helps us evolve without it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.190" end="00:10:57.270" style="s2">creates the tension it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.080" end="00:10:59.430" style="s2">like that sharpening rock because we</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.270" end="00:11:02.610" style="s2">thought it blade would just stay pretty</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.430" end="00:11:05.399" style="s2">dull it asks of us to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.610" end="00:11:08.459" style="s2">reorganize at a higher level and when we</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.399" end="00:11:11.459" style="s2">do so I feel the unconsciousness just</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.459" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">catches up or the shadow that&#39;s created</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.459" end="00:11:18.570" style="s2">matches the new light and that interplay</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:21.839" style="s2">can be really beautiful however we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.570" end="00:11:24.839" style="s2">in a way wired biologically and mentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.839" end="00:11:26.580" style="s2">to avoid discomfort and avoid pain but</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.839" end="00:11:29.520" style="s2">it&#39;s only in this honest conscious</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.580" end="00:11:33.170" style="s2">suffering if you want to say which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.520" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">very heroic of going into shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.170" end="00:11:39.540" style="s2">understanding it integrating it do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:41.430" style="s2">really evolve so it&#39;s like in shadow is</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.540" end="00:11:43.470" style="s2">a piece in which you know you said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.430" end="00:11:45.390" style="s2">pretty intense well yeah I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.470" end="00:11:48.180" style="s2">really fling it and to at that point</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.390" end="00:11:50.310" style="s2">what I was making it around 2012 is when</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.180" end="00:11:55.020" style="s2">I had the idea and that I started in 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.310" end="00:11:58.230" style="s2">and 15 to actually make it I I felt</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.020" end="00:12:01.290" style="s2">there were people around me um who I</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.230" end="00:12:02.520" style="s2">felt like you know that the TRO and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.290" end="00:12:03.990" style="s2">just wanted to throw some things in</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.520" end="00:12:06.089" style="s2">their face and be like you have to look</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.990" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">at some things we were just talking</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.089" end="00:12:09.690" style="s2">before we started recording and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">mentioned that you basically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.690" end="00:12:13.260" style="s2">locked yourself away throughout the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:15.570" style="s2">making of it like it was very much a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.260" end="00:12:17.970" style="s2">kind of individual project can you tell</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.570" end="00:12:20.390" style="s2">me about that why why was that and what</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.970" end="00:12:23.160" style="s2">was the experience of making it like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.390" end="00:12:25.970" style="s2">didn&#39;t share the project with anyone I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:28.740" style="s2">didn&#39;t feel it would be understood and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:31.230" style="s2">the only way I could describe what I was</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.740" end="00:12:33.870" style="s2">intending to relay was to finish the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.230" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">piece then and relay it that way because</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.870" end="00:12:38.310" style="s2">it&#39;s not a verbal piece it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:41.610" style="s2">essay it&#39;s not a book it is simply an</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.310" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">experience and it&#39;s a barrage of images</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.610" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a tapestry that I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:52.580" style="s2">weave and so in that regard I had to</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:55.700" style="s2">be within my own space and then way</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.580" end="00:12:57.530" style="s2">excavate my own shadow then at work of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.700" end="00:12:59.840" style="s2">that so it&#39;s very much a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.530" end="00:13:03.020" style="s2">therapeutic process for you making it</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.840" end="00:13:05.660" style="s2">yeah it definitely was therapeutic so it</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.020" end="00:13:08.120" style="s2">it exercised a lot of this darkness that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.660" end="00:13:12.190" style="s2">made me feel okay with things as they</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.120" end="00:13:15.770" style="s2">are as I see them so that I can continue</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.190" end="00:13:19.220" style="s2">having integrated that and move forward</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.770" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">with inner solutions and move forward in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.220" end="00:13:24.640" style="s2">a way with which I could navigate this</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:27.110" style="s2">world with the full awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.640" end="00:13:31.870" style="s2">more negative implications of our world</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.110" end="00:13:34.400" style="s2">and yet make not make the best of it but</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.870" end="00:13:37.010" style="s2">and yet move forward efficiently and</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.400" end="00:13:37.520" style="s2">effectively well for myself and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.010" end="00:13:41.090" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.520" end="00:13:42.530" style="s2">so yeah art art is can be that and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.090" end="00:13:44.990" style="s2">actually should be done it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.530" end="00:13:48.130" style="s2">healing process for the artists and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.990" end="00:13:52.430" style="s2">audience in my opinion and at its best</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.130" end="00:13:55.720" style="s2">it should be a pillar of light that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.430" end="00:13:59.540" style="s2">aligns in a way outlines its audience</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.720" end="00:14:02.110" style="s2">because we need to be renewed and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.540" end="00:14:05.030" style="s2">think you will know that that</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.110" end="00:14:07.100" style="s2">traditional ceremonies rituals aligning</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.030" end="00:14:10.310" style="s2">to the cycles inherent in nature and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.100" end="00:14:13.010" style="s2">cosmos we fall away from knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.310" end="00:14:14.860" style="s2">being aware of the cycles we don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.010" end="00:14:17.660" style="s2">that renewal we don&#39;t get that with</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.860" end="00:14:20.090" style="s2">verification and so I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.660" end="00:14:25.090" style="s2">truthful art can do that and should aim</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.090" end="00:14:31.130" style="s2">to do that is to infuse a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.090" end="00:14:32.750" style="s2">impulse a transcendent element into our</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.130" end="00:14:36.220" style="s2">tendency to sort of like go into</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.750" end="00:14:38.810" style="s2">cultural mental entropy in our entropy</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.220" end="00:14:40.280" style="s2">we and we do that reveal fiying in</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.810" end="00:14:43.580" style="s2">various ways whether it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.280" end="00:14:46.310" style="s2">shopping or promotions and many ways we</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.580" end="00:14:49.720" style="s2">tried we needed but I feel that our</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.310" end="00:14:52.580" style="s2">spirit our emotions our psyche overall</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.720" end="00:14:54.380" style="s2">means that infusion that&#39;s sprinkling of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.580" end="00:14:56.510" style="s2">some something higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.380" end="00:14:59.000" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s suddenly a question I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.510" end="00:15:02.270" style="s2">love to ask you because I do get that</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.000" end="00:15:02.889" style="s2">sense of the real calling in of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.270" end="00:15:05.470" style="s2">transcend</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.889" end="00:15:07.749" style="s2">in your work and I don&#39;t see that so</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.470" end="00:15:09.819" style="s2">much in a lot of art nowadays I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.749" end="00:15:13.329" style="s2">can kind of talk about whether art has</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.819" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">become a lot more parochial than its</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.329" end="00:15:17.709" style="s2">concerns rather than trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:20.649" style="s2">these grand visions but I don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.709" end="00:15:22.449" style="s2">so much like but what do you do you see</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.649" end="00:15:25.359" style="s2">much art that is kind of aiming at that</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.449" end="00:15:27.759" style="s2">kind of grand vision nowadays yeah well</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.359" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t in to be fair I don&#39;t look hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.759" end="00:15:33.009" style="s2">enough so that&#39;s that having said that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:34.779" style="s2">see a lot of art that I work in</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.009" end="00:15:37.509" style="s2">animation so of course that&#39;s more craft</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.779" end="00:15:39.819" style="s2">based very pop culture driven so you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.509" end="00:15:43.059" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t get deep inquiry in any way</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.819" end="00:15:45.449" style="s2">and I find that even the deeper inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.059" end="00:15:48.929" style="s2">of some animations tend to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.449" end="00:15:51.399" style="s2">certain cultural narrative that I find I</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.929" end="00:15:56.199" style="s2">find it&#39;s popular at the moment but not</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.399" end="00:15:58.179" style="s2">very insightful so yeah what the artists</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.199" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">work the true artists work and and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.179" end="00:16:03.790" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s my aim and my good</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:07.689" style="s2">days is to to calibrate to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.790" end="00:16:09.429" style="s2">order to have inner integrity and so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.689" end="00:16:13.499" style="s2">artist has to be able to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.429" end="00:16:15.850" style="s2">transcendent realms in various ways and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.499" end="00:16:19.059" style="s2">through the interaction with these</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.850" end="00:16:22.899" style="s2">realms through emptying oneself of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.059" end="00:16:26.919" style="s2">cultural baggage being able to take that</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.899" end="00:16:29.649" style="s2">boom like grasp it with gentleness I</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.919" end="00:16:34.350" style="s2">think and sometimes with gentle force</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.649" end="00:16:37.689" style="s2">and be able to then make sense of it so</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.350" end="00:16:40.839" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a mystical experience the</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.689" end="00:16:45.730" style="s2">insight of the experience has to be felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.839" end="00:16:48.160" style="s2">then understood then put into some sort</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.730" end="00:16:50.350" style="s2">of human manifestation so that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.160" end="00:16:54.279" style="s2">translated to others and then put into</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.350" end="00:16:58.269" style="s2">putting to craft that can then be that</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.279" end="00:16:59.709" style="s2">stream can be felt by human beings who</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.269" end="00:17:02.049" style="s2">are functioning within these closed</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.709" end="00:17:06.299" style="s2">circuits that&#39;s just what we we tend to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.049" end="00:17:10.089" style="s2">do so the artists it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot to ask</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.299" end="00:17:12.610" style="s2">because true art has to be done by by</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.089" end="00:17:13.500" style="s2">the initiates of the true work the real</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.610" end="00:17:16.380" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.500" end="00:17:20.400" style="s2">and that work is not easy and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.380" end="00:17:23.220" style="s2">promoted anywhere and it&#39;s not mmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.400" end="00:17:27.390" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not part of our culture to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.220" end="00:17:29.669" style="s2">that that work so we need we need more</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.390" end="00:17:32.010" style="s2">artists to be doing really hard work</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.669" end="00:17:35.940" style="s2">working on their craft and translating</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.010" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">the transcendent and introducing a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:43.799" style="s2">higher order of reality so that the rest</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">of us can can glean it consider it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.799" end="00:17:48.990" style="s2">possibly even you know take it on and</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">embody it yeah I mean it feels like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.990" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">narrative lie aren&#39;t used to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:56.940" style="s2">intrinsically tied to religious feeling</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:18:01.320" style="s2">to calling in the transcendent calling</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.940" end="00:18:03.120" style="s2">into like really the higher aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.320" end="00:18:05.669" style="s2">our nature and it feels like especially</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:07.890" style="s2">with post-modernism the idea of any kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.669" end="00:18:12.059" style="s2">of grand narrative or anything to reach</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.890" end="00:18:14.429" style="s2">for beyond this world it sort of is</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.059" end="00:18:15.860" style="s2">considered naive so I guess what what</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.429" end="00:18:18.419" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.860" end="00:18:20.070" style="s2">rekindle that sort of sense of something</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.419" end="00:18:22.679" style="s2">bigger something beyond ourselves yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.070" end="00:18:24.539" style="s2">and there&#39;s there was a necessity in my</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.679" end="00:18:25.830" style="s2">opinion and definitely the things that</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.539" end="00:18:27.720" style="s2">are the things that happen in the art</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.830" end="00:18:29.970" style="s2">world in the 20th century were necessary</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.720" end="00:18:32.460" style="s2">and I think it was a necessary cleansing</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.970" end="00:18:35.220" style="s2">of the palette in a way but I think it</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.460" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">turned it creator psychosis in the art</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.220" end="00:18:39.990" style="s2">world and then that aligned into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:42.390" style="s2">social media culture the scenester</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:43.890" style="s2">aspect the the not enough Nestor needs</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.390" end="00:18:46.020" style="s2">to be filled by status and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.890" end="00:18:48.210" style="s2">artists just like our creators all</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.020" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">perfectly well mostly they just keep it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.210" end="00:18:52.049" style="s2">to creators</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:53.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a status game in a race upward</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.049" end="00:18:56.580" style="s2">to some sort of you know satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.880" end="00:18:59.789" style="s2">which never will come sorry but you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.580" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">so it&#39;s that while that was necessary in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.789" end="00:19:03.870" style="s2">post-modernism etcetera I think people</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:05.789" style="s2">are just a bit too fixated now into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.870" end="00:19:08.460" style="s2">this like you know just being a bit too</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.789" end="00:19:10.049" style="s2">cool which is unfortunate that&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.460" end="00:19:11.460" style="s2">bondage and quite a trap</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.049" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">not to be able to feel deeply into</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.460" end="00:19:15.450" style="s2">something and I&#39;m definitely of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:18.120" style="s2">opinion and the feeling in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.450" end="00:19:20.039" style="s2">that I can truly appreciate more and</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.120" end="00:19:23.309" style="s2">more tradition when I book it into I</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.039" end="00:19:24.840" style="s2">consider it take it in and also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.309" end="00:19:26.940" style="s2">can appreciate the need</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.840" end="00:19:28.710" style="s2">challenged tradition to elevate it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.940" end="00:19:32.190" style="s2">to keep restructuring and so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.710" end="00:19:35.760" style="s2">available and apt for our time and for</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.190" end="00:19:37.710" style="s2">our situations and and this polarity of</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.760" end="00:19:39.539" style="s2">like either-or that you know our culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.710" end="00:19:41.730" style="s2">keeps going into sometimes being is</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.539" end="00:19:43.409" style="s2">being steered into it&#39;s much more easily</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.730" end="00:19:46.470" style="s2">manageable that way but we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.409" end="00:19:49.070" style="s2">creatures of we want a final answer and</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.470" end="00:19:50.760" style="s2">final certainty so yeah it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.070" end="00:19:52.470" style="s2">full tradition</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.760" end="00:19:54.570" style="s2">it&#39;s not about full dismantling of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.470" end="00:19:56.789" style="s2">things it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a mix of the two</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.570" end="00:19:58.200" style="s2">you got to be rebellious while knowing</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.789" end="00:19:59.700" style="s2">what you&#39;re stepping onto and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.200" end="00:20:01.830" style="s2">stepping on to the efforts of so many</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.700" end="00:20:03.450" style="s2">men and women that have brought us here</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.830" end="00:20:06.120" style="s2">you know the fabrics that we wear the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.450" end="00:20:07.590" style="s2">walls they&#39;re like these things we we</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.120" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">live on the you know the shoulders of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.590" end="00:20:11.130" style="s2">giants and I think there should be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:13.529" style="s2">of gratitude for that while also</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.130" end="00:20:15.299" style="s2">innovating constantly so we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.529" end="00:20:17.940" style="s2">at the razor edge of reality right here</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.299" end="00:20:19.860" style="s2">right now aware of it all were also</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.940" end="00:20:22.200" style="s2">aware of our own sense yeah and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.860" end="00:20:24.870" style="s2">mentioned sort of the the the the trap</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.200" end="00:20:26.760" style="s2">of cool within within the art world and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.870" end="00:20:29.250" style="s2">that also sort of links up for me with</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.760" end="00:20:31.110" style="s2">cynicism it&#39;s like it&#39;s much easier if</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.250" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">you&#39;re cynical if you&#39;re producing</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.110" end="00:20:35.820" style="s2">something that&#39;s quite cynical then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">very hard to be sort of ridiculed or</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.820" end="00:20:38.940" style="s2">criticized for that it&#39;s when you</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.159" style="s2">actually reach for the grand visions and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.940" end="00:20:42.690" style="s2">the grand sort of potentials that then</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.159" end="00:20:44.070" style="s2">you kind of open yourself out to being</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.690" end="00:20:47.940" style="s2">criticized or opening yourself up to</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.070" end="00:20:50.539" style="s2">being made fun of so it&#39;s yeah putting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.940" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">forward such a kind of compelling</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.539" end="00:20:54.390" style="s2">potential kind of awakening vision as</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:56.820" style="s2">well kind of the idea of awakening it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.390" end="00:21:00.870" style="s2">sort of can be seen as so cliched or so</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.820" end="00:21:02.669" style="s2">new-age or so kind of 1960s well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.870" end="00:21:04.350" style="s2">from the past so actually putting that</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.669" end="00:21:05.190" style="s2">out as an act of bravery it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.350" end="00:21:07.500" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.190" end="00:21:09.779" style="s2">thank you yeah it&#39;s funny that the Asian</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:12.270" style="s2">saying of the nail that sticks out gets</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.779" end="00:21:15.690" style="s2">hammered down like it&#39;s just so true and</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.270" end="00:21:17.370" style="s2">and all spheres of society the high</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.690" end="00:21:19.980" style="s2">intellectual realms and the so-called</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.370" end="00:21:23.130" style="s2">sophisticated realms you know one has to</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.980" end="00:21:24.270" style="s2">maintain a tailored image of oneself and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.130" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">I know that there are functions for that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.270" end="00:21:27.450" style="s2">you know I have to do it in certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:31.470" style="s2">instances and I&#39;m trying now to do it as</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.450" end="00:21:34.590" style="s2">much but that keeps us that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.470" end="00:21:36.040" style="s2">coolness you know that that just keeps</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.590" end="00:21:37.960" style="s2">us limited to</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.040" end="00:21:40.360" style="s2">- again if I keep saying this but a</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.960" end="00:21:43.300" style="s2">closed circuit a certain groove that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.360" end="00:21:46.060" style="s2">chose oh and and then we become binded</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.300" end="00:21:48.160" style="s2">to that and we can&#39;t escape it so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.060" end="00:21:53.110" style="s2">thank you for for the compliment of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.160" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">bravery my experience of it was I I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.110" end="00:21:59.110" style="s2">didn&#39;t face too much inner resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:00.910" style="s2">releasing it so I would say you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.110" end="00:22:02.410" style="s2">true courage comes when there&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.910" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">face of a lot of fears so I didn&#39;t face</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.410" end="00:22:07.930" style="s2">too much fear and releasing it I did of</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:10.720" style="s2">course you know anticipate some ridicule</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.930" end="00:22:13.930" style="s2">and and all sorts of claims of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.720" end="00:22:16.780" style="s2">unsophisticated and etc etc but I felt</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.930" end="00:22:19.780" style="s2">this was I wanted to do this I felt that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.780" end="00:22:21.370" style="s2">it was okay to throw my hat out and be</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.780" end="00:22:23.830" style="s2">like yeah yeah here are some things I</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.370" end="00:22:26.470" style="s2">stand for when I released the film I I</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.830" end="00:22:28.180" style="s2">had grown past many of the things not</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.470" end="00:22:29.620" style="s2">past but I had grown a sophistication in</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.180" end="00:22:32.290" style="s2">the way that I understood many of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.620" end="00:22:35.230" style="s2">things I elaborated in the film and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.290" end="00:22:39.220" style="s2">of course I wanted that to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.230" end="00:22:41.650" style="s2">recognised perhaps and but but I also</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.220" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">saw that there&#39;s a there&#39;s value in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.650" end="00:22:46.600" style="s2">film as it was for for for people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:49.270" style="s2">are on the ladder of coram quote</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.600" end="00:22:51.130" style="s2">awakening or just reorganizing their or</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.270" end="00:22:52.720" style="s2">claiming the sovereignty of their own</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.130" end="00:22:54.490" style="s2">decision-making and interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:22:56.380" style="s2">the world because what is awakening</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.490" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">awaken and I think is this signpost</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.380" end="00:23:01.240" style="s2">catch-all term that a lot of people you</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.830" style="s2">know it&#39;s a god lot of people can</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.240" end="00:23:05.920" style="s2">project all kinds of things into and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.830" end="00:23:09.130" style="s2">just wave it off but Awakening is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.920" end="00:23:12.540" style="s2">it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s all there is what else</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.130" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">is there but to climb the ladder of</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.540" end="00:23:17.950" style="s2">conscious realization and integration of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:20.830" style="s2">more and more sense data and being</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.950" end="00:23:24.190" style="s2">present with it and seeing it as it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.830" end="00:23:26.470" style="s2">and creating our own world through our</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.190" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">perceptions but I just don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.470" end="00:23:29.850" style="s2">anything more noble than that because</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">it&#39;s only through that that we can act</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.850" end="00:23:34.090" style="s2">rightfully into the world that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:35.860" style="s2">imprint ourselves into the world in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.090" end="00:23:38.590" style="s2">way that truly matters and that helps</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.860" end="00:23:41.490" style="s2">this whole ecosystem of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.590" end="00:23:44.170" style="s2">grow you know I&#39;d love to ask what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.490" end="00:23:46.930" style="s2">have made of the reception to the film I</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.170" end="00:23:49.110" style="s2">think it&#39;s got it&#39;s got over 2 million</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.930" end="00:23:51.510" style="s2">views on YouTube families and</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.110" end="00:23:53.820" style="s2">- now yeah I believe it&#39;s two million</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.510" end="00:23:55.410" style="s2">you know it&#39;s on Vimeo and people have</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.820" end="00:23:57.330" style="s2">been posting it on Facebook it has its</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.410" end="00:23:58.590" style="s2">own so it&#39;s taken off from there in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.330" end="00:24:00.510" style="s2">other ways as well</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.590" end="00:24:04.140" style="s2">what have you made of the reception to</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.510" end="00:24:06.390" style="s2">it so far I I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve I&#39;ve I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.140" end="00:24:08.820" style="s2">taken as much pleasure as I could have</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.390" end="00:24:10.650" style="s2">out of it I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.820" end="00:24:12.270" style="s2">it my correspondence is what there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.650" end="00:24:14.990" style="s2">been a lot of correspondence with with</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.270" end="00:24:17.520" style="s2">viewers getting in touch some of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.990" end="00:24:20.940" style="s2">some of their thoughts and views on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.520" end="00:24:23.100" style="s2">film have been quite staggering</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.940" end="00:24:25.980" style="s2">magnificent and have given me a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.100" end="00:24:28.920" style="s2">insight it&#39;s I&#39;m glad to say that the</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.980" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">film has had a real-life impact in some</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.920" end="00:24:34.650" style="s2">people so the experiment worked</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:38.460" style="s2">now I know that the recipe can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.650" end="00:24:42.410" style="s2">refined and moving forward and so what</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.460" end="00:24:45.930" style="s2">have I made of it is that people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.410" end="00:24:48.450" style="s2">clearly hungry for some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.930" end="00:24:52.770" style="s2">recognition that things are not okay in</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.450" end="00:24:58.590" style="s2">a certain way what aspects of the world</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">may not be okay and really to to feel</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.590" end="00:25:02.460" style="s2">that there is something beyond it that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:05.100" style="s2">you know in the grand scheme of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.460" end="00:25:09.660" style="s2">this is in a way a game it gave a game</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.100" end="00:25:13.950" style="s2">of restructuring integrating and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.660" end="00:25:15.810" style="s2">that need as there&#39;s a yeah I you know a</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.950" end="00:25:17.550" style="s2">big question that comes up as one is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.810" end="00:25:20.310" style="s2">next one coming up or what what my next</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.550" end="00:25:23.790" style="s2">artworks will be and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.310" end="00:25:25.290" style="s2">very understandable so there is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.790" end="00:25:27.510" style="s2">element of just consuming mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.290" end="00:25:31.380" style="s2">though within that and um not taking it</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.510" end="00:25:33.960" style="s2">in but I think people are are hungry for</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.380" end="00:25:36.900" style="s2">real visceral experiences that touch</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.960" end="00:25:38.370" style="s2">them beyond the intellect so you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.900" end="00:25:40.440" style="s2">made the film and sent it out there what</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.370" end="00:25:41.610" style="s2">were you hoping to get from that and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.440" end="00:25:45.120" style="s2">what do you hope people will get from</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.610" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">the film and well my hope was for people</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.120" end="00:25:51.090" style="s2">who are not who take reality as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:54.180" style="s2">given to them as its curated for them</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.090" end="00:25:55.710" style="s2">and for them to be jarred out of it at</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.180" end="00:25:57.390" style="s2">least a little bit for at least some</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.710" end="00:25:59.080" style="s2">seeds to be planted and that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.390" end="00:26:02.350" style="s2">germinate into more inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.080" end="00:26:03.519" style="s2">into you know the images of the film in</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.350" end="00:26:04.779" style="s2">the film itself I was hoping would</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.519" end="00:26:06.009" style="s2">recontextualize some of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.779" end="00:26:08.649" style="s2">relationships that we take for granted</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.009" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">between institutions and ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.649" end="00:26:15.070" style="s2">the greater social framework so my hope</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:17.320" style="s2">was mostly for the people who may be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.070" end="00:26:19.960" style="s2">quite caught up with in their habitual</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.320" end="00:26:21.940" style="s2">patterns to be really like to chart out</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.960" end="00:26:25.929" style="s2">of that with a strong punch to the solar</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.940" end="00:26:28.710" style="s2">plexus to get their own will out there</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.929" end="00:26:32.169" style="s2">moving into the world yeah I guess one</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.710" end="00:26:35.109" style="s2">one comment I I have I sent it out to my</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.169" end="00:26:38.309" style="s2">email list to receive people&#39;s responses</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.109" end="00:26:42.789" style="s2">to it and one comment that came back was</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.309" end="00:26:44.289" style="s2">that is there a danger in seeing I guess</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.789" end="00:26:47.049" style="s2">there&#39;s a question to you as well like</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.289" end="00:26:49.239" style="s2">that that there&#39;s a lot of sort of kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.049" end="00:26:51.220" style="s2">of almost like puppet-masters energy in</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.239" end="00:26:52.690" style="s2">the film sort of behind behind people</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.220" end="00:26:55.029" style="s2">who are speaking there&#39;s there&#39;s moneyed</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.690" end="00:26:56.710" style="s2">interests do you see it as a group of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.029" end="00:26:58.210" style="s2">people or do you see it as sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.710" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">strange attractors of money and power</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.210" end="00:27:04.029" style="s2">because I I&#39;m I I personally I would see</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.200" end="00:27:05.859" style="s2">it more as the latter kind of that there</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.029" end="00:27:07.539" style="s2">are that there are they have their own</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.859" end="00:27:10.029" style="s2">force that money in power has its own</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.539" end="00:27:11.830" style="s2">corrupting influence on these things not</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.029" end="00:27:14.909" style="s2">so much that there&#39;s sort of a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.830" end="00:27:17.980" style="s2">puppet masters kind of energy to it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.909" end="00:27:20.919" style="s2">yeah I mean I I would go I would say</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.980" end="00:27:24.669" style="s2">both and I&#39;ll go into that I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.919" end="00:27:28.450" style="s2">ecosystem of power control is is complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.669" end="00:27:30.909" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure anyone&#39;s done a great</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.450" end="00:27:32.919" style="s2">great intricate job in explaining it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.909" end="00:27:34.179" style="s2">diving deep into it because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.919" end="00:27:39.129" style="s2">intellectual sphere</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.179" end="00:27:42.639" style="s2">looks down upon your alternate theories</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.129" end="00:27:44.409" style="s2">that maybe a bit too far away from you</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.639" end="00:27:45.940" style="s2">know what&#39;s deemed acceptable within</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.409" end="00:27:47.590" style="s2">their spheres when I find that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.940" end="00:27:50.529" style="s2">unfortunately that really impedes</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.590" end="00:27:51.369" style="s2">progress and and excavating the reality</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.529" end="00:27:54.549" style="s2">of the situation</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.369" end="00:27:57.879" style="s2">I do see uninvested a certain</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.549" end="00:28:01.509" style="s2">concentrated interest with certain goals</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.879" end="00:28:05.950" style="s2">certain outcomes steadily at the very</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.509" end="00:28:10.629" style="s2">least about the 20th century you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.950" end="00:28:11.419" style="s2">for that sort of for that to really sink</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.629" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.419" end="00:28:17.329" style="s2">there are leaked think-tank papers there</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:19.969" style="s2">there are a lot of legitimate resources</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.329" end="00:28:23.089" style="s2">out there which can really show us the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.969" end="00:28:25.249" style="s2">intentions and a coherent shaping of</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.089" end="00:28:29.929" style="s2">society in a certain way in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.249" end="00:28:31.579" style="s2">direction now I don&#39;t like blaming those</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.929" end="00:28:35.599" style="s2">powers I just want to recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.579" end="00:28:37.929" style="s2">they are there and that I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.599" end="00:28:40.219" style="s2">their unconscious to a large degree I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.929" end="00:28:42.649" style="s2">feel that they&#39;re running many programs</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.219" end="00:28:44.899" style="s2">and in a way it&#39;s their imperative once</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.649" end="00:28:50.450" style="s2">they connected to the momentum of their</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.899" end="00:28:53.179" style="s2">in-group I believe that these yeah these</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.450" end="00:28:55.789" style="s2">sort of tendencies get propagated a kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.179" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">of ongoing question for us but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.789" end="00:29:01.039" style="s2">kind of been kind of playing with quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:02.839" style="s2">a while is where are the artists as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.039" end="00:29:08.389" style="s2">sort of question because there does seem</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.839" end="00:29:12.559" style="s2">to be a sort of an emerging cultural</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.389" end="00:29:13.940" style="s2">movement or at least a sort of a set of</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.559" end="00:29:15.589" style="s2">people who are asking similar questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.940" end="00:29:17.959" style="s2">who are sort of asking these deeper</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.589" end="00:29:19.579" style="s2">questions about reality but the jordan</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.959" end="00:29:21.769" style="s2">green halls or the daniel Shmack tim</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.579" end="00:29:25.909" style="s2">burgers or some of these people with</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.769" end="00:29:28.129" style="s2">very sort of big visions for game a</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.909" end="00:29:29.690" style="s2">being the society that we&#39;ve got now and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.129" end="00:29:31.940" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of coming to the end of life</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.690" end="00:29:33.649" style="s2">and then game B being something that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.940" end="00:29:35.119" style="s2">emergent we don&#39;t really know what it</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.649" end="00:29:39.489" style="s2">looks like but it certainly seems to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.119" end="00:29:42.379" style="s2">have elements of authentic dialogue of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.489" end="00:29:44.529" style="s2">inter subjective collective intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.379" end="00:29:47.269" style="s2">of all of these different factors and</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.529" end="00:29:50.779" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of saying okay see if this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.269" end="00:29:52.249" style="s2">a thing then where are normally cultural</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.779" end="00:29:54.289" style="s2">movements are driven by art they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.249" end="00:29:56.059" style="s2">driven by the outliers of the artists</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.289" end="00:29:58.309" style="s2">and I&#39;m not really seeing so many people</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.059" end="00:30:00.109" style="s2">dealing with those questions I&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.309" end="00:30:00.440" style="s2">that you you definitely are are one of</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.109" end="00:30:01.969" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.440" end="00:30:06.289" style="s2">do you have any thoughts about that like</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.969" end="00:30:10.219" style="s2">where are the artists in this space yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.289" end="00:30:12.320" style="s2">well I think true artists disincentivize</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.219" end="00:30:14.359" style="s2">so the art world leans in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.320" end="00:30:16.759" style="s2">direction and it&#39;s within the you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.359" end="00:30:19.819" style="s2">the dictates of the Empire and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.759" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">Empire controls art controls fill it</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.819" end="00:30:23.929" style="s2">controls media it&#39;s just the way it is</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:26.299" style="s2">this is why we see synchronized there</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.929" end="00:30:28.580" style="s2">pop-up to define any situation for us</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.299" end="00:30:30.740" style="s2">and that has to be challenged any</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.580" end="00:30:32.720" style="s2">challenges to the to the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.740" end="00:30:35.119" style="s2">narrative that&#39;s being imposed by</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.720" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">artists those artists get the platform</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.119" end="00:30:39.379" style="s2">and deeply disincentivized and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:40.940" style="s2">discouraged from going forward so where</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.379" end="00:30:43.240" style="s2">are the artists I feel there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.940" end="00:30:46.129" style="s2">of artists that are capable and willing</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.240" end="00:30:48.679" style="s2">but to create our keynote requires</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.129" end="00:30:51.799" style="s2">personal discipline fortitude and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.679" end="00:30:54.340" style="s2">vision and and staying power with it you</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.799" end="00:30:55.940" style="s2">know like no production no no no</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.340" end="00:30:58.909" style="s2">procrastination it means building</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.940" end="00:31:01.519" style="s2">character and and there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.909" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">encouragement and rewards for that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.519" end="00:31:05.990" style="s2">work it&#39;s exhausting and it&#39;s it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:08.029" style="s2">taxing and if there is no reward than</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.990" end="00:31:09.440" style="s2">even in the form of a tap on the back</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.029" end="00:31:11.809" style="s2">and saying thank you like you brought</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.440" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">something it may be wrong it may not be</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.809" end="00:31:15.529" style="s2">you know the right it&#39;s in the right</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">direction and you you risked to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.529" end="00:31:22.639" style="s2">and so yeah the things that I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:25.159" style="s2">I could do now I can&#39;t quite do because</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.639" end="00:31:27.759" style="s2">of other things happening with me quote</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.159" end="00:31:30.200" style="s2">unquote career-wise that may</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.759" end="00:31:32.230" style="s2">strategically in the future yield the</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.200" end="00:31:34.100" style="s2">greater benefit for a game for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.230" end="00:31:37.309" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.100" end="00:31:39.379" style="s2">but I think there&#39;s there&#39;s fear in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.309" end="00:31:40.639" style="s2">atmosphere so artists do need to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.379" end="00:31:43.190" style="s2">courageous right now and I think they</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.639" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">really need to be supported but we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.190" end="00:31:50.659" style="s2">we have many artists thematic Wars or</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:53.210" style="s2">you know our rife with Mike all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.659" end="00:31:55.100" style="s2">geniuses in my opinion and that digital</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.210" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">magic the digital spells are being cast</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.100" end="00:32:00.350" style="s2">constantly they rewired consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:04.340" style="s2">and they create new connections and new</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.350" end="00:32:06.950" style="s2">relations to to to our reality so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.340" end="00:32:09.830" style="s2">almost like art now is more a guerrilla</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.950" end="00:32:11.629" style="s2">warfare it&#39;s not this establishment</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.830" end="00:32:14.720" style="s2">authorized stamped and approved</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.629" end="00:32:16.309" style="s2">Hollywood film the January comedy or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.720" end="00:32:21.110" style="s2">know whatever it is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.309" end="00:32:22.759" style="s2">Pentagon a war a narrative but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.110" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">don&#39;t know just even just saying that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.759" end="00:32:26.629" style="s2">relating to this to you I feel an</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:28.610" style="s2">emerging sense that yeah the artists</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.629" end="00:32:29.779" style="s2">actually are there it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.610" end="00:32:32.659" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna come out with their</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.779" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">flag and be like I am here I think that</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.659" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">are emerging and you know as the old</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:42.139" style="s2">guard crumbles and I&#39;m starting to see</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:44.059" style="s2">the beginning a beginning of that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.139" end="00:32:45.409" style="s2">we&#39;ll see and I guess the question a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.059" end="00:32:49.070" style="s2">of people who enjoyed the film will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.409" end="00:32:51.109" style="s2">asking is is there a sequel gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.070" end="00:32:53.929" style="s2">is that what happens next</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.109" end="00:32:56.929" style="s2">yeah well what happens next I think will</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.929" end="00:32:59.179" style="s2">have to happen in the real world what</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.929" end="00:33:00.649" style="s2">happens next for me as of a few things</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.179" end="00:33:02.809" style="s2">in the can I&#39;m working on something</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.809" end="00:33:07.609" style="s2">craft right now beyond that I am writing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.109" end="00:33:09.289" style="s2">something and we&#39;ll see it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.609" end="00:33:13.580" style="s2">it&#39;s something more involved and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.289" end="00:33:16.070" style="s2">something I think more powerful and if</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.580" end="00:33:18.379" style="s2">the right if the right forces come</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.070" end="00:33:21.440" style="s2">together my inner and outer forces I</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.379" end="00:33:23.149" style="s2">will manifest itself if not that&#39;s okay</p>
