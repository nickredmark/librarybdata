<p begin="00:00:00.599" end="00:00:06.450" style="s2">right welcome to idea cafe today we are</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:08.160" style="s2">discussing if we had a years to prepare</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.450" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2">for the pandemic if somehow we knew this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">was happening a year in the future or if</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:13.320" style="s2">we knew about it a year ago what would</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:16.139" style="s2">we have liked to have in place either</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.320" end="00:00:17.640" style="s2">personally societally what would you</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.139" end="00:00:19.980" style="s2">like to Patty place if you had some</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.640" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">forewarning would like to start is</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.980" end="00:00:27.090" style="s2">welcome to or as per usual I can oh I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">go I mean the obvious answer is vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.090" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">and tests right I mean if you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:31.230" style="s2">coming and you know what it is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.000" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">coming then there&#39;s no reason in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.230" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">world not to have a huge stockpile of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:37.620" style="s2">vaccines and tests and an antiviral</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.550" end="00:00:39.329" style="s2">drugs and so on at the ready so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.620" end="00:00:41.730" style="s2">that that&#39;s the obvious answer but of</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.329" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">course the reality is we never know</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.730" end="00:00:45.000" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s coming down the road</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:47.820" style="s2">right the best we can do is prepare</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.000" end="00:00:50.100" style="s2">ourselves for as broader range of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.820" end="00:00:52.110" style="s2">eventualities that we can foresee as</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.100" end="00:00:54.510" style="s2">possibilities right something like that</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.110" end="00:00:57.360" style="s2">so yeah I mean I&#39;ve come to this wanting</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.510" end="00:00:58.829" style="s2">to promote is the wrong word that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.360" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">like I&#39;m selling something right but</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.829" end="00:01:03.870" style="s2">promote the idea of resilience just</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">generally up and down at every scale</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.870" end="00:01:09.240" style="s2">throughout the economy that this is how</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.939" end="00:01:10.860" style="s2">you prepare yourself for disasters given</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.240" end="00:01:13.380" style="s2">the reality that as I say you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.860" end="00:01:15.630" style="s2">what&#39;s coming down the road so you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.380" end="00:01:19.979" style="s2">things like for example when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.630" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">healthcare system is under strain you</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.979" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">know people that it has all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:26.970" style="s2">knock-on effects in addition to that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">right there it&#39;s not just the healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.970" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">system its financial systems its supply</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:36.390" style="s2">lines its logistical systems its storage</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:38.220" style="s2">facilities it&#39;s you I mean all of these</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.390" end="00:01:40.049" style="s2">kinds of things are impacted and so the</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.220" end="00:01:41.460" style="s2">the interconnectedness of everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.049" end="00:01:44.159" style="s2">which is inevitable in a modern society</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.460" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">right thing once everything&#39;s computed</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.159" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">it the interconnectedness is inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:53.189" style="s2">but what you can do is build things in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:56.240" style="s2">sort of whole onok nature right so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.189" end="00:01:59.100" style="s2">the whole world is not depending on one</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.240" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">you know wheat supplier or whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:03.590" style="s2">know what I mean that these things are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:06.450" style="s2">broken down into much much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.590" end="00:02:09.660" style="s2">autonomous units much more localization</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.450" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">much more much more distributed networks</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.660" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">of things rather than these giant</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:14.820" style="s2">production sensors</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.640" style="s2">which if that gets hit the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.820" end="00:02:20.370" style="s2">goes down right so that that&#39;s for me</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.640" end="00:02:21.690" style="s2">the basic point is is smaller scale</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.370" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">everything where it&#39;s where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.690" end="00:02:25.320" style="s2">sensible to do so right and food</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:27.450" style="s2">production energy production water</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.320" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">purification these can all be done at a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.450" end="00:02:31.890" style="s2">sort of neighborhood community at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:33.960" style="s2">town level right these do not need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.890" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">national infrastructures these can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.960" end="00:02:37.380" style="s2">broken down these are much much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">units and that builds resilience in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.380" end="00:02:39.960" style="s2">right you know if one person goes down</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:41.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a whole bunch of other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.960" end="00:02:43.860" style="s2">around them who have got spare capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.550" end="00:02:47.010" style="s2">that can help them out right it just it</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.860" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">just it installs a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.010" end="00:02:52.500" style="s2">redundancy spare capacity into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:55.080" style="s2">system but yeah well it&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.500" end="00:02:56.460" style="s2">to go is the efficiency profit motive</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.080" end="00:02:57.720" style="s2">because while things are run as</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.460" end="00:02:58.950" style="s2">efficiently as possible they&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.720" end="00:03:00.570" style="s2">at full capacity all the time right</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.950" end="00:03:02.370" style="s2">because to run it less than full</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.570" end="00:03:03.690" style="s2">capacity is simply not as efficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.370" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">financially as running at full capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.690" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">so that has to go so hopefully this is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:10.920" style="s2">big enough kick in the ass that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:13.410" style="s2">actually reconsider these fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.920" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">constants of human existence on this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.410" end="00:03:20.010" style="s2">earth things like you know interest</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:23.550" style="s2">bearing money and debt based currencies</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.010" end="00:03:24.959" style="s2">and the profit motive being paramount</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.550" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">right that the company&#39;s primary</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.959" end="00:03:29.580" style="s2">function is to produce profits for its</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">shareholders you know that these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.580" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">thinking needs to go right at sets over</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">three minutes I&#39;ll shut up now yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:40.800" style="s2">I know no point just filling a sign for</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:42.420" style="s2">the sake of it I&#39;ve made my point like I</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.800" end="00:03:45.410" style="s2">could make it again in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.420" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">but you know that&#39;s going to be boring</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.410" end="00:03:52.470" style="s2">Karen would you like to go to America</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">um once you go oh sorry I have questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.470" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">to comment on Eric&#39;s after but what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.170" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">would have liked to have in place the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:04:01.190" style="s2">idea this question was basically that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:03.570" style="s2">there is stuff coming down the pipeline</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.190" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">so although we can&#39;t have this stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.570" end="00:04:06.870" style="s2">place for this one we can always have it</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">in place for the next catastrophe where</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.870" end="00:04:11.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a pandemic whether it&#39;s climate</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">change whether it&#39;s anything right what</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.580" end="00:04:15.989" style="s2">I would have loved to have in place is</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.140" end="00:04:18.390" style="s2">more technological infrastructure on</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.989" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">like how to facilitate in telehealth</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.390" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">right how to facilitate how we actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:27.240" style="s2">help one another how to help people stay</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:28.919" style="s2">in quarantine and when they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.240" end="00:04:31.740" style="s2">aren&#39;t they instead of punishing and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.919" end="00:04:34.139" style="s2">giving fines and doing an authoritative</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.740" end="00:04:36.210" style="s2">why aren&#39;t you because there&#39;s a need</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.139" end="00:04:40.919" style="s2">that&#39;s not being met if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.210" end="00:04:42.630" style="s2">breaking physical distancing and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.919" end="00:04:44.699" style="s2">meeting people where they are and</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.630" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">building those those things and I would</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.699" end="00:04:50.699" style="s2">also I don&#39;t know if a year would have</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:52.919" style="s2">been enough time but I would love to if</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.699" end="00:04:55.800" style="s2">I&#39;d known I maybe would have had more of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.919" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">a gung-ho attitude to like starting an</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.800" end="00:05:03.990" style="s2">actual physical community that isn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.840" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">the city which has a lot more fragile</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.990" end="00:05:07.889" style="s2">supply chain when stuff stops coming in</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">the city you don&#39;t necessarily have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.889" end="00:05:11.699" style="s2">space to grow food you don&#39;t have you</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:13.169" style="s2">know especially didn&#39;t grow food it</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.699" end="00:05:15.060" style="s2">takes time for food to grow I just plan</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.169" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">started my garden yesterday I would&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.060" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">had like to have more gardening help to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">actually be able to like sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.610" style="s2">have someone help me plan what I could</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:26.039" style="s2">grow in my yard what I will eat what</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.610" end="00:05:29.130" style="s2">could grow here with the mainly that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.039" end="00:05:30.659" style="s2">sun exposure and although I&#39;m doing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.130" end="00:05:32.520" style="s2">the best of my ability to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.659" end="00:05:34.320" style="s2">coordinate that to be able to say and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.520" end="00:05:35.909" style="s2">that is something that actually is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.320" end="00:05:37.620" style="s2">happen six months a year down the line</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.909" end="00:05:39.630" style="s2">not now right we&#39;re not in a food</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.620" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">shortage now but we could be in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.630" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">future and so bringing people together I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.050" end="00:05:49.590" style="s2">would also have loved to have more</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:52.259" style="s2">mental health stuff in place for people</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.590" end="00:05:55.620" style="s2">going through having to sequester having</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.259" end="00:05:58.530" style="s2">options of couples counseling that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.620" end="00:06:00.360" style="s2">require a counselor where you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.530" end="00:06:01.560" style="s2">sit down with a peer or have peer groups</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.360" end="00:06:03.210" style="s2">of like here&#39;s what we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.560" end="00:06:05.759" style="s2">and how do we how do we get through that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.210" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">I would like basically an entire</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.759" end="00:06:12.210" style="s2">infrastructure which is what I am</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:16.710" style="s2">created of peer to peer support peer to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.210" end="00:06:18.360" style="s2">peer systems that help us meet our needs</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.710" end="00:06:20.490" style="s2">without relying on our governments I</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.360" end="00:06:22.530" style="s2">would have liked to have information</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.490" end="00:06:24.060" style="s2">sources in place that we can trust</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.530" end="00:06:25.800" style="s2">because we&#39;re seeing what a what a lack</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.060" end="00:06:28.110" style="s2">of trust in our governments and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.800" end="00:06:30.780" style="s2">media is costing us ie people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.110" end="00:06:32.849" style="s2">social distancing and they&#39;re you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.780" end="00:06:34.650" style="s2">in every conspiracy theory&#39; abounds</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.849" end="00:06:36.870" style="s2">because how do you know what&#39;s true we</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.650" end="00:06:38.699" style="s2">don&#39;t have one place to go and the one</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.870" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">time we need them to we maybe need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.699" end="00:06:40.950" style="s2">actually be listening</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:44.310" style="s2">governments and the powers that be</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.950" end="00:06:45.960" style="s2">they&#39;ve cried wolf so many times that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.310" end="00:06:49.290" style="s2">don&#39;t trust them</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.960" end="00:06:50.820" style="s2">and so I would have loved to have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.290" end="00:06:53.100" style="s2">system in place where we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.820" end="00:06:55.350" style="s2">witness each other around the world so I</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.100" end="00:06:57.120" style="s2">find myself constantly googling like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.350" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">what&#39;s going on in Iran right now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.120" end="00:07:00.660" style="s2">going on in Italy right now and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:02.640" style="s2">no really option to know that besides</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.660" end="00:07:04.440" style="s2">through the regular media I would have</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.640" end="00:07:06.150" style="s2">liked to have something like periscope</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.440" end="00:07:10.350" style="s2">with it&#39;s actually set up with like</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.150" end="00:07:12.360" style="s2">there&#39;s you can watch a live broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.350" end="00:07:14.610" style="s2">of someone&#39;s telling you what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.360" end="00:07:15.960" style="s2">in that country once a day shirring</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.610" end="00:07:17.550" style="s2">something like this where we are so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.960" end="00:07:20.060" style="s2">interconnected and would not something</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.550" end="00:07:22.620" style="s2">like this a one-off event a war</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.060" end="00:07:24.710" style="s2">hurricane and anything that&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.620" end="00:07:27.660" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s actually going on in them</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.710" end="00:07:28.950" style="s2">in the vicinity so there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.660" end="00:07:31.620" style="s2">things kind of like the physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.950" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">community the technology the food that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.620" end="00:07:35.280" style="s2">all of it which is what we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:37.170" style="s2">doing in solution raising or dinner talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.280" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">about the mental health period portion</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.170" end="00:07:46.740" style="s2">tomorrow you&#39;re Shiloh and I said that</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:51.150" style="s2">is my my turn so if I had had a year I</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.740" end="00:07:53.760" style="s2">think along the lines Jubilee a physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.150" end="00:07:57.000" style="s2">community I think the what I would have</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.760" end="00:08:01.350" style="s2">liked to have had in place was a place</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.000" end="00:08:06.630" style="s2">outside of the city to get to to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.350" end="00:08:10.470" style="s2">to we have we have the financial means</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.630" end="00:08:12.480" style="s2">to be able to afford some space and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.470" end="00:08:20.340" style="s2">you know having something where we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.480" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">have people come in order to you know be</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.340" end="00:08:26.090" style="s2">able to build start building that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:31.080" style="s2">community in person having a stronger</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.090" end="00:08:35.940" style="s2">in-person community then then what we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.080" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">have currently I think the it you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.940" end="00:08:42.570" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting I kept it I I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:47.640" style="s2">looking at this more from the individual</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.570" end="00:08:49.830" style="s2">like what if a year ago I had known that</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.640" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">maybe not that this this virus was</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.830" end="00:08:53.810" style="s2">coming but that something that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:55.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.810" end="00:08:56.900" style="s2">virus coming and until it comes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.640" end="00:09:01.460" style="s2">not going to know anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.900" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to know anything you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.460" end="00:09:09.650" style="s2">know there&#39;s I think I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.820" end="00:09:16.660" style="s2">working on gardening I would have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.650" end="00:09:19.730" style="s2">working on having one kind of so like</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.660" end="00:09:22.490" style="s2">that sounds like a a silly thing but I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.730" end="00:09:29.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to so and so learning how</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.490" end="00:09:32.030" style="s2">to like learning how to call the garden</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.960" end="00:09:35.210" style="s2">I have started my garden I have corn and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.030" end="00:09:39.230" style="s2">I have peas and my cantaloupe just</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:55.630" style="s2">but also what else would in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.840" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">like the bigger things more in place for</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.630" end="00:10:02.740" style="s2">being able to yeah have the Oh</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.370" end="00:10:18.080" style="s2">counseling situation and I would also</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.240" end="00:10:21.770" style="s2">want to be advocating for or or putting</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.080" end="00:10:26.450" style="s2">into place the more of the tools in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.770" end="00:10:31.820" style="s2">terms of plant medicine to help people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.450" end="00:10:36.250" style="s2">deal with like the mental problems you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.820" end="00:10:40.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s like okay right now people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.250" end="00:10:42.920" style="s2">options are psychiatric meds alcohol pot</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.280" end="00:10:44.750" style="s2">like there&#39;s more options than that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.920" end="00:10:46.610" style="s2">figuring out you know which ones make</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.750" end="00:10:54.050" style="s2">more sense for who and how does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.610" end="00:10:55.940" style="s2">work and yeah I know yeah Eric and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.050" end="00:10:57.380" style="s2">already went so an idea cafe is your</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.940" end="00:10:59.240" style="s2">first one we each take up to five</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.380" end="00:11:01.940" style="s2">minutes to share answering the question</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.240" end="00:11:03.980" style="s2">for for that week and this question is</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.940" end="00:11:06.050" style="s2">if we had a year to prepare for this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.980" end="00:11:07.519" style="s2">pandemic and social distance II</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.050" end="00:11:11.510" style="s2">what would we have liked to have in</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.519" end="00:11:13.160" style="s2">place if we knew I had 4,000 and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.510" end="00:11:14.720" style="s2">allowed to share or pass you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.160" end="00:11:18.260" style="s2">to be the hot see you ready to get in</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.720" end="00:11:22.730" style="s2">but I guess I can share a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.260" end="00:11:25.130" style="s2">I would I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about I</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.730" end="00:11:27.860" style="s2">guess you&#39;d call it a cooperative social</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.130" end="00:11:30.019" style="s2">structure so just like a counterbalance</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.860" end="00:11:34.339" style="s2">to capitalism that values our</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.019" end="00:11:36.279" style="s2">interconnectedness and so if we had</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.339" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">something like that already in place</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.279" end="00:11:42.829" style="s2">where we had let&#39;s say at least one</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:44.720" style="s2">physical hub and every community of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.829" end="00:11:47.930" style="s2">seven to ten thousand people plus</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.720" end="00:11:50.209" style="s2">satellite hubs which are just I call</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.930" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">them hubs for like human Union buildings</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.209" end="00:11:56.810" style="s2">where you can truly go and connect for</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:59.480" style="s2">solutions or just to make connections I</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.810" end="00:12:02.600" style="s2">think for our especially our mental</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.480" end="00:12:04.579" style="s2">health our our interactions with each</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.600" end="00:12:07.399" style="s2">other and our emotional support really</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.579" end="00:12:13.910" style="s2">comes from hand come from people close</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.399" end="00:12:16.310" style="s2">to us so also we have a way of valuing</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.910" end="00:12:18.529" style="s2">all those things as well as our</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.310" end="00:12:22.310" style="s2">environments and just kind of a mapping</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.529" end="00:12:24.829" style="s2">of our collective instead of our</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.310" end="00:12:31.130" style="s2">competitive side so anyway I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.829" end="00:12:33.560" style="s2">that couldn&#39;t so now we can just check</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.130" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">open it up and chat for the next next</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.560" end="00:12:38.029" style="s2">hour because I did have Eric was the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:39.620" style="s2">first one to share your first thing of</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.029" end="00:12:41.990" style="s2">like well if we knew this was coming we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.620" end="00:12:43.610" style="s2">want vaccines and tests to be there and</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.990" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">although I get that that is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.610" end="00:12:46.310" style="s2">tongue-in-cheek it&#39;s like well how what</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:47.930" style="s2">would that look like so if we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.310" end="00:12:50.029" style="s2">know it was coronavirus this exact one</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.930" end="00:12:52.579" style="s2">Kovach 19 we just knew that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.029" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">pandemic coming yeah what would it look</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.579" end="00:12:58.070" style="s2">like to have the infrastructure in place</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:13:00.649" style="s2">to get those vaccines out faster to get</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.070" end="00:13:02.449" style="s2">out faster no matter what it is I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.649" end="00:13:04.190" style="s2">one suggestion a specific one along the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.449" end="00:13:06.500" style="s2">lines of what I was saying before right</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.190" end="00:13:08.360" style="s2">about about making sure that there is</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.500" end="00:13:09.500" style="s2">additional capacity built in at every</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.360" end="00:13:12.589" style="s2">stage right and so when you&#39;re designing</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.500" end="00:13:14.959" style="s2">a factory rather than optimizing the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.589" end="00:13:16.520" style="s2">factory perfectly for that one product</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.959" end="00:13:19.260" style="s2">that is going to be producing in vast</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.520" end="00:13:21.210" style="s2">quantities you general</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.260" end="00:13:24.120" style="s2">so you build it in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.210" end="00:13:25.980" style="s2">can be relatively easily repurposed for</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.120" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">a wide range of other functions now that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.980" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">means that it&#39;s not going to be quite as</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.690" end="00:13:32.310" style="s2">well optimized for its primary function</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:34.950" style="s2">right because you&#39;re having to build you</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.310" end="00:13:36.600" style="s2">know essentially unnecessarily things to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.950" end="00:13:38.040" style="s2">its primary function in order to allow</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.040" end="00:13:41.520" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be less profit for the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.960" end="00:13:44.130" style="s2">factory builder right less profit for</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.520" end="00:13:47.130" style="s2">the manufacturer a larger upfront costs</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.130" end="00:13:49.110" style="s2">for example but in the long term you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.130" end="00:13:50.910" style="s2">got something which in the event of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.110" end="00:13:52.650" style="s2">pandemic can be repurposed immediately</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.910" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">to start making test kits or syringes or</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.650" end="00:13:56.460" style="s2">masks or ventilators or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:57.510" style="s2">might be you not I mean and if it&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.460" end="00:13:59.400" style="s2">other kind of disaster it can be</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.510" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">repurposed to make batteries or solar</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:07.530" style="s2">might be they sort of mean and so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.180" end="00:14:09.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this huge capacity so all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.530" end="00:14:11.310" style="s2">a sudden make a load of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.570" end="00:14:13.560" style="s2">you need in the face of disaster you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.310" end="00:14:15.390" style="s2">know really quickly really easily these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.560" end="00:14:16.440" style="s2">things can be repurposed this would not</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.390" end="00:14:18.380" style="s2">be difficult to do this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.440" end="00:14:20.820" style="s2">difficult technical challenge but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.380" end="00:14:25.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a significant financial cost</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.820" end="00:14:30.030" style="s2">involved I think the the piece of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.560" end="00:14:33.270" style="s2">is how do you how do you convince people</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.030" end="00:14:35.580" style="s2">or help people to understand that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.270" end="00:14:39.540" style="s2">you know if you optimize solely for one</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.580" end="00:14:42.270" style="s2">thing then you know there are trade-offs</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.540" end="00:14:44.670" style="s2">and so you know Eric you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.270" end="00:14:48.270" style="s2">about the in in that case the you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.670" end="00:14:50.760" style="s2">manufacturing the one that I see is the</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.270" end="00:14:53.490" style="s2">one in hospitals of being solely</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.760" end="00:14:55.950" style="s2">optimized for efficiency so there so</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.490" end="00:14:59.010" style="s2">demise for efficiency and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.950" end="00:15:01.050" style="s2">have which means that they have no spare</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.010" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">capacity so if there is any load</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.050" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">whatsoever then there then the system</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.010" style="s2">gets over what you know has the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:09.510" style="s2">potential to get overwhelmed but again</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.010" end="00:15:11.370" style="s2">this is easily fixed right you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.510" end="00:15:13.560" style="s2">spare Ward&#39;s which are just shut most of</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.370" end="00:15:15.450" style="s2">the time right those beds and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.560" end="00:15:17.220" style="s2">beds and wiring and plumbing and so on</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.450" end="00:15:18.540" style="s2">there and they just shut most of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.220" end="00:15:19.950" style="s2">time but you&#39;ve got the capacity there</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.540" end="00:15:21.540" style="s2">to open them up at very short notice</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.950" end="00:15:23.610" style="s2">equally you have in the same way that</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.540" end="00:15:24.900" style="s2">they have reserves in the military right</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.610" end="00:15:26.820" style="s2">and they go into a couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.900" end="00:15:28.260" style="s2">training every year and they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.820" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">part of the folder you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.260" end="00:15:31.020" style="s2">with the health service we can help you</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:33.270" style="s2">kind of health professional reserves</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.020" end="00:15:34.709" style="s2">right who are either retired or</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.270" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">they don&#39;t have quite a high level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.709" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">training the doctor but but in an</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:40.140" style="s2">emergency they&#39;re really good you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.339" style="s2">extra pairs of hands useful pairs of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.140" end="00:15:42.660" style="s2">hands around the place but again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.339" end="00:15:43.950" style="s2">financial costs all of these right</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.660" end="00:15:45.270" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a maintain train you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.950" end="00:15:47.339" style="s2">maintained space but a maintained</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.270" end="00:15:49.920" style="s2">equipment which is not in use most at</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.339" end="00:15:52.350" style="s2">the time and that&#39;s that&#39;s the only way</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.920" end="00:15:54.839" style="s2">I see you doing it well one of one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.350" end="00:15:56.700" style="s2">the interesting things I&#39;ve seen is I</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.839" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">was reading an article I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.700" end="00:16:04.050" style="s2">an LA Times where the companies who come</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:07.080" style="s2">in and build all of the the stages and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.050" end="00:16:09.149" style="s2">the tents and everything for things like</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.080" end="00:16:12.839" style="s2">Coachella and all of these you know the</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.149" end="00:16:15.860" style="s2">summer festivals immediately pivoted and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.839" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">started building tents for hospitals and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.860" end="00:16:25.080" style="s2">so you know like the capacity you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:29.190" style="s2">one thing is is like there&#39;s I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.080" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">know there&#39;s identifying where the I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.190" end="00:16:34.380" style="s2">think it&#39;s more about being able to</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:37.339" style="s2">identify where is their rigidity in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.380" end="00:16:40.950" style="s2">system where is there an inability to</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.339" end="00:16:43.589" style="s2">pivot so that would and in a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.950" end="00:16:47.940" style="s2">would be an area where there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.589" end="00:16:51.390" style="s2">not a lot of resilience and and so how</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.940" end="00:16:53.579" style="s2">do you help or how do you you know I</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.390" end="00:16:55.649" style="s2">mean how do you point out to an</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.579" end="00:16:58.110" style="s2">individual you&#39;re not resilient like</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.649" end="00:17:00.329" style="s2">that&#39;s not a sin like that&#39;s not an easy</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.110" end="00:17:02.700" style="s2">thing to do you can&#39;t just tell somebody</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.329" end="00:17:04.290" style="s2">they&#39;re not resilient and but yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.700" end="00:17:06.179" style="s2">you have to kind of have an event like</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.290" end="00:17:08.069" style="s2">this to see where that stuff comes up</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.179" end="00:17:10.290" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s fun exercise in terms</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.069" end="00:17:11.459" style="s2">of the mental thing but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.290" end="00:17:14.429" style="s2">like yeah I think it would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.459" end="00:17:17.760" style="s2">identifying where is their rigidity in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.429" end="00:17:20.640" style="s2">system you know both and I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.760" end="00:17:24.449" style="s2">rigidity would be probably like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.640" end="00:17:26.459" style="s2">first like first thing you would</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.449" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">encounter and then underneath you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.459" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">realize oh this this part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:33.510" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have any resilience hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:33.929" style="s2">it&#39;s everywhere Kiera this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.510" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">the point</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.929" end="00:17:36.870" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s everywhere been doing this</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:39.660" style="s2">for decades there we&#39;ve been driving</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.870" end="00:17:42.210" style="s2">towards efficiency and you know driving</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.660" end="00:17:43.800" style="s2">down costs and outsourcing this and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.210" end="00:17:45.540" style="s2">and right you know driving production</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.800" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">overseas to where it&#39;s cheaper and all</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.540" end="00:17:46.680" style="s2">of this kind of thing we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:48.690" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.680" end="00:17:52.380" style="s2">for decades right there&#39;s very very very</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.690" end="00:17:55.140" style="s2">little more efficiencies to be had and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.380" end="00:17:56.640" style="s2">so we have reached almost a point of</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.140" end="00:17:58.230" style="s2">maximum fragility right there was</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:17:59.430" style="s2">virtually no resilience left in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.230" end="00:18:01.740" style="s2">system at all we&#39;ve been doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.430" end="00:18:03.330" style="s2">such a long time I think both because</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.740" end="00:18:05.220" style="s2">you guys had talked about like having</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.330" end="00:18:06.510" style="s2">extra wings in a hospital just in case</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.220" end="00:18:08.430" style="s2">something like this happens and that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.510" end="00:18:10.320" style="s2">seems like a lot of real estate and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.430" end="00:18:15.090" style="s2">resources to be put into something just</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.320" end="00:18:17.850" style="s2">in case these things happen there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:20.880" style="s2">just right well my point is then Kyra</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.850" end="00:18:22.730" style="s2">talked about the stages and that those</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.880" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">people kind of pivoted and were able to</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.730" end="00:18:29.720" style="s2">now a constant like to have everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.530" end="00:18:31.920" style="s2">set up for every potential possibility</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.720" end="00:18:33.630" style="s2">does the opposite of what we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.920" end="00:18:34.860" style="s2">with efficiency on a horrible scale</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.630" end="00:18:36.420" style="s2">right like because it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.860" end="00:18:37.920" style="s2">pandemic we set up for we need to set up</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.420" end="00:18:40.110" style="s2">our pandemics and floods and all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.920" end="00:18:41.820" style="s2">these things the same suite aliens come</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.110" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">in zombies things we don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.820" end="00:18:46.890" style="s2">even even can really comprehend except</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:49.560" style="s2">in media and so there was something</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.890" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">about like having a brainstorming as</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.560" end="00:18:55.190" style="s2">place or we could coordinate to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:57.690" style="s2">here are the people we need right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.190" end="00:18:58.860" style="s2">like there are people who are like oh</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.690" end="00:19:00.720" style="s2">yeah we can build tents they are</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.860" end="00:19:02.130" style="s2">probably the ones who instigated it but</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.720" end="00:19:03.540" style="s2">if someone else could have thought I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.130" end="00:19:05.040" style="s2">been like you know who&#39;s not employed</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.540" end="00:19:07.650" style="s2">right now all the coachella people</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.040" end="00:19:08.820" style="s2">signup stages and they would be perfect</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.650" end="00:19:10.980" style="s2">to be able to orchestrate something like</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.820" end="00:19:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like finding the piece working</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.980" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">together to find the piece that could be</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.170" end="00:19:16.800" style="s2">best used and then yes we&#39;re we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:20.670" style="s2">retrofitting factories like having them</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.800" end="00:19:23.670" style="s2">set up to be modular which is what cube</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.670" end="00:19:27.080" style="s2">spawn is kind of doing like it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.670" end="00:19:29.460" style="s2">gaming world where you&#39;re manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.080" end="00:19:31.410" style="s2">anything alcohol because it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.460" end="00:19:33.390" style="s2">things right now that is is and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.410" end="00:19:35.190" style="s2">they easily pivoted to make hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.390" end="00:19:37.200" style="s2">sanitizer that was awesome</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.190" end="00:19:39.240" style="s2">I haven&#39;t at the same time we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.200" end="00:19:41.430" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have a shortage with</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.240" end="00:19:44.340" style="s2">different problems but to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.430" end="00:19:45.930" style="s2">like if we own all the factories it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.340" end="00:19:47.310" style="s2">makes sense to be able to have them</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:49.170" style="s2">pivot it doesn&#39;t make sense to have them</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.310" end="00:19:51.270" style="s2">turning out at their hundred percent it</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.170" end="00:19:52.650" style="s2">makes sense to make them produce what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.270" end="00:19:54.660" style="s2">need and then be able to have them</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.650" end="00:19:57.150" style="s2">pivots for like oh we&#39;re short on TVs we</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.660" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">need TVs this this year we need like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.150" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">be able to have it&#39;s like access</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:02.870" style="s2">information kind of gets us all of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">because if we had mapped the supply</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.870" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">chain we could know how to retrofit a</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:09.020" style="s2">factory to meet needs because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.400" style="s2">just gonna go back to making TVs that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.020" end="00:20:12.440" style="s2">why they&#39;re there right they&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.400" end="00:20:16.220" style="s2">making TVs and making TVs 24 hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.440" end="00:20:17.720" style="s2">7 days a week and then the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.220" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">that you guys talked about certain</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.720" end="00:20:23.000" style="s2">applies but is where you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:24.770" style="s2">having like a reserve of medical</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.000" end="00:20:26.419" style="s2">training stuff and I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.770" end="00:20:28.549" style="s2">actually really important I know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.419" end="00:20:29.600" style="s2">of countries Germany and Israel that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.549" end="00:20:31.669" style="s2">become smite although I think what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.600" end="00:20:35.179" style="s2">think Germany maybe switch third or they</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.669" end="00:20:36.980" style="s2">have mandatory military having four or</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.179" end="00:20:39.080" style="s2">five sectors that are absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.980" end="00:20:41.809" style="s2">necessary that you pick one in to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.080" end="00:20:43.850" style="s2">mandatory training right so maybe when</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.809" end="00:20:45.710" style="s2">you&#39;re 20 you make medical training you</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.850" end="00:20:47.120" style="s2">take food train like whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.710" end="00:20:48.559" style="s2">that&#39;s like these are the four or five</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.120" end="00:20:50.150" style="s2">and you get to pick which one you go</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.559" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">into and if there&#39;s so many people here</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.150" end="00:20:53.450" style="s2">maybe we give an incentive to go into</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:54.380" style="s2">one stuff you need but then you would</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.450" end="00:20:56.780" style="s2">have this you don&#39;t need necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.380" end="00:20:58.549" style="s2">nurses and doctors you need someone who</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.780" end="00:21:03.950" style="s2">can administer a test right like you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.549" end="00:21:06.320" style="s2">need lower-level you need like millions</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.950" end="00:21:08.200" style="s2">of lower level rather than then they can</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.320" end="00:21:11.210" style="s2">free up the nurses and doctors to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.200" end="00:21:13.250" style="s2">that work more like a lot of sadly the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.210" end="00:21:15.530" style="s2">Nerds as time is taken up right now</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.250" end="00:21:17.510" style="s2">sitting with dying patients right who do</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:19.460" style="s2">kind of their families in that is</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.510" end="00:21:22.100" style="s2">something that anyone who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.460" end="00:21:23.630" style="s2">susceptible to it could do and probably</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.100" end="00:21:25.940" style="s2">better than a nurse who&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.630" end="00:21:27.350" style="s2">that emotional impact with them to go on</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.940" end="00:21:29.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s not what they signed up to</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.350" end="00:21:33.200" style="s2">do they signed up to heal people no</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.240" end="00:21:34.460" style="s2">they&#39;re not in palliative care there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.200" end="00:21:36.500" style="s2">million things changing sheets</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.460" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">delivering meals cleaning the floors</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.500" end="00:21:40.010" style="s2">there&#39;s a million things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.159" style="s2">non-experts could be doing which will</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.010" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">take a load off absolutely absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.159" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">well and I think I come at this from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:51.710" style="s2">slightly different perspective of like</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">I&#39;m not necessarily in favor of a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.710" end="00:22:01.100" style="s2">socialist type situation but not but not</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:04.190" style="s2">opposed to it entirely either and so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.100" end="00:22:06.770" style="s2">know it like how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.190" end="00:22:08.330" style="s2">create a system where there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.770" end="00:22:10.700" style="s2">somebody you know because you said if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.330" end="00:22:12.649" style="s2">controlled all of the factories well if</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.700" end="00:22:13.040" style="s2">we controlled all of the if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.649" end="00:22:15.500" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.040" end="00:22:18.919" style="s2">if there&#39;s some centralized thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.500" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">controlling all of the factories there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.919" end="00:22:25.190" style="s2">a there&#39;s a point of failure too and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:26.900" style="s2">how do you distribute yeah you know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.190" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">like the concept of the distributed</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.900" end="00:22:31.669" style="s2">cognition how do you distribute the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:34.850" style="s2">knowledge that&#39;s needed throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.669" end="00:22:38.840" style="s2">system you know I mean that what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.850" end="00:22:40.580" style="s2">been interesting and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.840" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">things that we&#39;re learning it and and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.580" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">this is something I heard Jordan hall</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:50.000" style="s2">say on a thing on Friday I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:53.660" style="s2">Friday or Saturday you know we we seen</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.000" end="00:22:55.940" style="s2">how people mobilize for the face masks</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.660" end="00:22:58.570" style="s2">like people have mobilized and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.940" end="00:23:01.910" style="s2">solved this problem like a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.570" end="00:23:03.710" style="s2">basically solved in terms of like air</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.910" end="00:23:05.030" style="s2">lifting stuff from China instead of</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.710" end="00:23:07.910" style="s2">letting it come over on a boat I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.030" end="00:23:09.980" style="s2">all of these different pieces and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.910" end="00:23:12.740" style="s2">have we learned you know it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.980" end="00:23:15.890" style="s2">have we learned from that that is going</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.740" end="00:23:18.590" style="s2">to apply to when we have to feed people</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.890" end="00:23:22.100" style="s2">because in Africa they&#39;re having put</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.590" end="00:23:23.690" style="s2">plagues of locusts that are decimating</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.100" end="00:23:24.950" style="s2">their crops and they&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.690" end="00:23:26.690" style="s2">have it they&#39;re not gonna have a food</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.950" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">supply this year so what do you have you</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.690" end="00:23:31.970" style="s2">know it&#39;s like so what if we were to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:34.580" style="s2">work backwards like knowing what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.970" end="00:23:37.370" style="s2">learned now about that how would we work</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.580" end="00:23:40.669" style="s2">backwards in terms of like mobilization</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.370" end="00:23:42.169" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like localization you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.669" end="00:23:43.400" style="s2">can I rephrase can i rephrase your</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.169" end="00:23:44.870" style="s2">question in a slightly different way</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.400" end="00:23:49.340" style="s2">Cara because I think I think it might be</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.870" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">a more useful way to ask it right</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.340" end="00:23:53.000" style="s2">because as you pointed out things like</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:54.440" style="s2">the face mask problem you just leave</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.000" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">people alone to crack on with it they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.440" end="00:23:57.320" style="s2">figure out a way and they&#39;ll solve it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:59.720" style="s2">right and so rather than how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.320" end="00:24:01.549" style="s2">create the systems whereby this can</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.720" end="00:24:04.250" style="s2">happen I think a better question to ask</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.549" end="00:24:05.929" style="s2">is what are the barriers currently in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.250" end="00:24:06.710" style="s2">the way of just allowing that to happen</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.929" end="00:24:08.660" style="s2">on its own</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.710" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">right and I and I think that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.660" end="00:24:14.419" style="s2">much more the point right things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:17.200" style="s2">intellectual property and what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.419" end="00:24:19.880" style="s2">called patent laws and government</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.200" end="00:24:22.700" style="s2">contracts on things that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.880" end="00:24:24.530" style="s2">stuff these are barriers to people just</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.700" end="00:24:26.190" style="s2">figuring stuff out amongst themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.530" end="00:24:28.590" style="s2">remove those barriers</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.190" end="00:24:31.230" style="s2">and I think the systems will create</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.590" end="00:24:34.289" style="s2">themselves well and I would I would take</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.230" end="00:24:38.309" style="s2">that one step further and say it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.289" end="00:24:41.820" style="s2">though I mean the the physical barrier</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.309" end="00:24:44.669" style="s2">is those things but there&#39;s the one step</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.820" end="00:24:47.549" style="s2">up from that is the difference in values</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.669" end="00:24:50.100" style="s2">of you know and this comes back to our</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.549" end="00:24:57.450" style="s2">original example of prioritizing</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.100" end="00:24:59.279" style="s2">efficiency over over resilience or yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.450" end="00:25:01.769" style="s2">since you have a resilience it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.279" end="00:25:04.529" style="s2">know okay we have optimized for this and</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.769" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">now we see that that&#39;s not going to work</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.529" end="00:25:11.970" style="s2">all of the time and so like there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:15.029" style="s2">conversation of what are we optimizing</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.970" end="00:25:19.440" style="s2">for that&#39;s putting those barriers in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.029" end="00:25:21.059" style="s2">place and what are we optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.440" end="00:25:24.659" style="s2">that&#39;s causing those barriers to be put</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.059" end="00:25:29.850" style="s2">in place and what our emotion in a word</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.659" end="00:25:33.240" style="s2">profit and and what is it that we want</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.850" end="00:25:37.769" style="s2">to optimize for I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.240" end="00:25:40.649" style="s2">don&#39;t know that I could have articulated</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.769" end="00:25:44.940" style="s2">prior to this that you know hospitals</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.649" end="00:25:47.070" style="s2">were optimized for efficiency or for</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.940" end="00:25:49.320" style="s2">efficiency and didn&#39;t have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.070" end="00:25:51.389" style="s2">for the resilience I didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.320" end="00:25:53.759" style="s2">have known those but we can identify</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.389" end="00:25:56.909" style="s2">that the profit part but what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.759" end="00:26:04.049" style="s2">thing that that we&#39;re not optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.909" end="00:26:09.830" style="s2">in the case of patent laws what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.049" end="00:26:12.210" style="s2">optimizing for maximum fluidity and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.830" end="00:26:14.220" style="s2">effectiveness of collaboration right</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.210" end="00:26:16.350" style="s2">because you&#39;re it&#39;s exclusionary you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.220" end="00:26:18.750" style="s2">saying only this small group of people</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.350" end="00:26:19.889" style="s2">can work on this thing right and all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.750" end="00:26:20.639" style="s2">the other people in the world who would</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.889" end="00:26:22.769" style="s2">be interested in that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.639" end="00:26:24.659" style="s2">contribution to make are excluded from</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.769" end="00:26:28.379" style="s2">being able to make that contribution so</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.659" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">you&#39;re optimizing for profit for this</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.379" end="00:26:33.929" style="s2">company at the expense of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.220" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">actually collaborate meaningfully on</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.929" end="00:26:39.270" style="s2">this important thing what does it what</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:41.670" style="s2">does exclusion or the the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.270" end="00:26:47.460" style="s2">were the reverse of that what is</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.670" end="00:26:50.910" style="s2">inclusion optic what does that what does</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.460" end="00:26:52.500" style="s2">that optimize for and I&#39;m asking because</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.910" end="00:26:56.070" style="s2">I don&#39;t know the answer to that because</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.500" end="00:27:00.990" style="s2">if you&#39;re not in law it&#39;s weird because</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.070" end="00:27:02.460" style="s2">it actually optimizes both ways for we</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.990" end="00:27:05.310" style="s2">depending on which is camp you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.460" end="00:27:06.450" style="s2">full innovation right there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.310" end="00:27:07.320" style="s2">are like if we don&#39;t have patents no</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.450" end="00:27:08.250" style="s2">one&#39;s going to innovate because they</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.320" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">don&#39;t get to own the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.250" end="00:27:10.890" style="s2">property of it and we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:12.390" style="s2">that&#39;s and then there&#39;s other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.890" end="00:27:13.740" style="s2">were like what we can&#39;t innovate if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.390" end="00:27:15.360" style="s2">have intellectual property because we</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.740" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">can&#39;t use it unless we do like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.360" end="00:27:20.520" style="s2">all of these barriers and innovation ok</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:24.810" style="s2">not that sounds like more of a word that</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.520" end="00:27:27.510" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine yes correct yes of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.810" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">innovation yeah because that inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.510" end="00:27:31.260" style="s2">word I was like I don&#39;t I couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:35.640" style="s2">connect with that and so I was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.260" end="00:27:36.840" style="s2">figure out yeah yeah there&#39;s just no</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.640" end="00:27:38.370" style="s2">evidence to support that first</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.840" end="00:27:39.990" style="s2">opposition though jewbilee that people</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.370" end="00:27:41.250" style="s2">don&#39;t innovate if they can&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.990" end="00:27:42.330" style="s2">intellectual property and make the money</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.250" end="00:27:44.760" style="s2">off it afterwards people innovate</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:46.020" style="s2">because they have ideas in them right</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.760" end="00:27:47.190" style="s2">and they want to come out and it&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:49.500" style="s2">simple as that you know what I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.190" end="00:27:51.030" style="s2">though the the and it&#39;s very often not</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.500" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">the person that has the idea that makes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.030" end="00:27:54.060" style="s2">the money off it anyway it&#39;s someone who</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:55.530" style="s2">Nick&#39;s the idea or buys it off them</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.060" end="00:27:57.150" style="s2">really cheap and then market it or</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.530" end="00:27:58.440" style="s2">whatever you know what I mean Edison did</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.150" end="00:28:00.030" style="s2">this time and time and time in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.440" end="00:28:03.000" style="s2">number of inventions that Edison stole</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.030" end="00:28:04.770" style="s2">his American Hero right and he</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.000" end="00:28:09.900" style="s2">was a criminal plain and simply little</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.770" end="00:28:13.770" style="s2">robber an extortionist I&#39;m curious about</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.900" end="00:28:20.670" style="s2">what show those plots are we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.770" end="00:28:25.530" style="s2">each other so it&#39;s a really broad topic</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.670" end="00:28:28.050" style="s2">and I guess I&#39;ve been living with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.530" end="00:28:31.620" style="s2">vision in my head for a long time so in</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.050" end="00:28:34.650" style="s2">my mind the solution is an inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.620" end="00:28:37.650" style="s2">society that has another level that&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.650" end="00:28:39.630" style="s2">the ground that interconnects us so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.650" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">can plan these things ahead and we make</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.630" end="00:28:44.429" style="s2">the connections like with our neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:48.450" style="s2">and our communities in the bigger world</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.429" end="00:28:51.629" style="s2">more solid and by having a system that</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.450" end="00:28:53.460" style="s2">actually values that I think makes a big</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.629" end="00:28:54.860" style="s2">difference and there is like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.460" end="00:28:58.259" style="s2">saying a lot of movement towards</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.860" end="00:29:00.690" style="s2">innovation that is in the share platform</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.259" end="00:29:03.710" style="s2">like the Creative Commons so there is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.690" end="00:29:06.929" style="s2">that trend towards people wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.710" end="00:29:10.230" style="s2">share their ideas for free or really low</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.929" end="00:29:14.179" style="s2">cost to get them out there because there</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.230" end="00:29:16.850" style="s2">is that barrier I don&#39;t know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.179" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s really hard to verbalize</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.850" end="00:29:23.970" style="s2">when you hear problems but you have</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:25.619" style="s2">inside yourself already this vision that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.970" end="00:29:28.499" style="s2">works through them really well it can be</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.619" end="00:29:34.830" style="s2">very hard to verbalize that tell me</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.499" end="00:29:37.139" style="s2">about it okay so the the word that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.830" end="00:29:40.289" style="s2">coming up for me that I hear you guys</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.139" end="00:29:47.210" style="s2">saying and I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m like I</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.289" end="00:29:50.460" style="s2">don&#39;t know the inclusion so what you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:52.259" style="s2">if we assume that everyone within a</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.460" end="00:29:54.090" style="s2">community might be at different levels</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.259" end="00:29:58.470" style="s2">of development and have different love</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.090" end="00:30:01.799" style="s2">different motivations how do you handle</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.470" end="00:30:03.629" style="s2">a situation where somebody might be mode</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.799" end="00:30:06.869" style="s2">where you might have a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.629" end="00:30:08.909" style="s2">who are motivated by participating in</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.869" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">the community but another group of</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.909" end="00:30:15.809" style="s2">people who are in their developmental</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:20.009" style="s2">process motivated by money or motivated</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.809" end="00:30:22.019" style="s2">by getting attention or you know by</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.009" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">something you know by something else how</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.019" end="00:30:30.139" style="s2">do you accommodate or people at</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:34.200" style="s2">different stages of emotional spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.139" end="00:30:38.549" style="s2">mental development where not everyone is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.200" end="00:30:39.720" style="s2">necessarily motivated solely by and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.549" end="00:30:42.690" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s completely off</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.720" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">topic but like it I think this although</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.690" end="00:30:47.070" style="s2">a topic after we&#39;ve answered the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:49.259" style="s2">question well but actually I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.070" end="00:30:52.379" style="s2">this this would be the type of question</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.259" end="00:30:54.410" style="s2">if we knew this was coming you know a</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.379" end="00:30:58.420" style="s2">question to be answered</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.410" end="00:31:01.790" style="s2">Shilo you had your uh I think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.420" end="00:31:03.950" style="s2">inclusion is that everybody is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.790" end="00:31:05.900" style="s2">and everybody has something to offer</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.950" end="00:31:08.140" style="s2">even if they&#39;re at different places and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.900" end="00:31:13.160" style="s2">I think that&#39;s the real difference with</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.140" end="00:31:14.840" style="s2">a bottom-up system I&#39;m not saying get</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.160" end="00:31:16.610" style="s2">rid of the top-down system I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.840" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">it&#39;s already there people are motivated</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.610" end="00:31:20.210" style="s2">by money</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:22.250" style="s2">people will function in that aspect but</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.210" end="00:31:24.440" style="s2">giving other people an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.250" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">function in a way that&#39;s more beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.440" end="00:31:31.850" style="s2">to the collective instead of just for</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:34.190" style="s2">the individual profit I think is a way</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.850" end="00:31:37.220" style="s2">to start to balance that out I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.190" end="00:31:39.650" style="s2">think that at all we need to control</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.220" end="00:31:43.160" style="s2">people&#39;s ideas or stop them from having</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.650" end="00:31:47.300" style="s2">their own passion or Drive I think by</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.160" end="00:31:49.250" style="s2">providing incentive in a way even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.300" end="00:31:51.800" style="s2">it&#39;s just recognition and support within</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.250" end="00:31:54.380" style="s2">your community through this system you</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.800" end="00:31:56.600" style="s2">actually get more participation from</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.380" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">people that might have very different</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.600" end="00:32:01.580" style="s2">ideas and motivations than just money</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:05.450" style="s2">and therefore more solutions more</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.580" end="00:32:11.750" style="s2">connectivity more ability to respond in</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.450" end="00:32:13.790" style="s2">times of crisis that makes coming up for</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.750" end="00:32:15.800" style="s2">me when Charlotte was speaking that was</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.790" end="00:32:18.290" style="s2">like I have this concept I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.800" end="00:32:21.170" style="s2">this morning on the broadcast of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.290" end="00:32:23.180" style="s2">people choosing to profit and purpose so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.170" end="00:32:25.580" style="s2">whatever industry you&#39;re in all of game</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.180" end="00:32:26.870" style="s2">a is focused on profit you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.580" end="00:32:29.180" style="s2">profit without having some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.870" end="00:32:30.710" style="s2">purpose but you need to be focused on</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.180" end="00:32:32.450" style="s2">profit and you can only leave two</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.710" end="00:32:33.770" style="s2">masters you have to are you in it for</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.450" end="00:32:36.290" style="s2">transportation are you in it to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.770" end="00:32:37.820" style="s2">money off of transportation but what</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.290" end="00:32:40.160" style="s2">came up for real Australia was talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.820" end="00:32:43.670" style="s2">you know was that we do have different</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.160" end="00:32:46.070" style="s2">value systems money is a placeholder for</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.670" end="00:32:48.740" style="s2">all of them and then we maximize for</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.070" end="00:32:50.420" style="s2">money somewhat it equals that out but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:52.430" style="s2">actually destroys them all because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.420" end="00:32:54.380" style="s2">like your access to money you might be</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.430" end="00:32:56.060" style="s2">for connection we think you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.380" end="00:32:58.790" style="s2">people out of it my access to money</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.060" end="00:33:01.310" style="s2">might be for to know that I can support</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.790" end="00:33:03.530" style="s2">myself more though that what it is but</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.310" end="00:33:04.910" style="s2">like it&#39;s the placeholder but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.530" end="00:33:06.380" style="s2">the problem because it&#39;s the placeholder</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.910" end="00:33:06.770" style="s2">like right now during this pen I gotta</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.770" end="00:33:10.130" style="s2">laughing about how the right it appears</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.130" end="00:33:13.760" style="s2">be the right it&#39;s like the left is like</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.380" end="00:33:15.050" style="s2">wait I&#39;m sorry the right is like we need</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.240" end="00:33:24.800" style="s2">right is like or the left is like closed</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.260" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s because aren&#39;t that like we got</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.800" end="00:33:27.230" style="s2">to the point where we&#39;re desperate</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:29.000" style="s2">enough that like the other person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.230" end="00:33:31.130" style="s2">values like our values are still the</p>

<p begin="00:33:31.130" end="00:33:35.690" style="s2">think having open borders hurt that in</p>

<p begin="00:33:47.330" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">in right now because we need to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.560" end="00:33:52.310" style="s2">sequester up but anyway God just thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:54.560" style="s2">that money was a placeholder for like</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.310" end="00:33:56.330" style="s2">all of these values but it&#39;s also where</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.560" end="00:33:57.700" style="s2">the conflict comes in because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.330" end="00:34:00.020" style="s2">telling you not turn money but what</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.700" end="00:34:02.030" style="s2">because whatever money was a placeholder</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.020" end="00:34:03.740" style="s2">for I&#39;m telling you we can optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.030" end="00:34:06.590" style="s2">that for you right so if you want</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.740" end="00:34:10.909" style="s2">security that was not security we can</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.590" end="00:34:12.200" style="s2">make sure you feel secure in a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.909" end="00:34:13.760" style="s2">way that we can make sure everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.200" end="00:34:15.470" style="s2">money because that game just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.760" end="00:34:17.510" style="s2">work money is based on debt and you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.470" end="00:34:20.390" style="s2">can&#39;t even break even let alone be in</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.510" end="00:34:23.330" style="s2">surplus you make a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.390" end="00:34:24.890" style="s2">point I I really like you said about you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.330" end="00:34:26.570" style="s2">know I&#39;m going into transportation am i</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.890" end="00:34:28.429" style="s2">doing it to make money am i doing it</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.570" end="00:34:31.250" style="s2">because I&#39;m interested in providing</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.429" end="00:34:33.020" style="s2">transportation right and these are two</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.250" end="00:34:36.230" style="s2">totally different things the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.020" end="00:34:37.940" style="s2">and this is a systemic thing this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.230" end="00:34:42.290" style="s2">really a choice thing this isn&#39;t down to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.940" end="00:34:44.870" style="s2">values until I mean it is but the values</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.290" end="00:34:46.370" style="s2">have broadly shift right because let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.870" end="00:34:48.350" style="s2">say you&#39;ve got two people who go into</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.370" end="00:34:49.550" style="s2">running bus companies right and one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.350" end="00:34:50.600" style="s2">them&#39;s doing it for the money and one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.550" end="00:34:52.700" style="s2">them doing it because they want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.600" end="00:34:56.690" style="s2">provide a good bus service for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.700" end="00:34:58.010" style="s2">citizens of that area right and the two</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.690" end="00:34:59.540" style="s2">are going to take very very different</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.010" end="00:35:00.620" style="s2">approaches right the one doing it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.540" end="00:35:01.820" style="s2">the for the for the good of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.620" end="00:35:03.140" style="s2">transportation is going to train their</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.820" end="00:35:05.090" style="s2">drivers property they&#39;re gonna buy good</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.140" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">vehicles they&#39;re gonna have a frequent</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.090" end="00:35:08.450" style="s2">service so that the things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.840" style="s2">overcrowded bla bla bla bla bla the</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.450" end="00:35:13.940" style="s2">other one is going to you know hire</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.840" end="00:35:15.800" style="s2">people as cheaply as possible use shitty</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.940" end="00:35:17.510" style="s2">clapped-out vehicles not maintain them</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.800" end="00:35:19.210" style="s2">very well run as few as they possibly</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.510" end="00:35:21.730" style="s2">can the things are always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.210" end="00:35:24.460" style="s2">now which of these two is going to win</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.730" end="00:35:26.260" style="s2">well person 2 is inevitably going to win</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.460" end="00:35:28.210" style="s2">because if you&#39;re an investor wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.260" end="00:35:29.349" style="s2">invest in a bus company that&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.210" end="00:35:31.540" style="s2">that&#39;s going to pay you more money right</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.349" end="00:35:34.030" style="s2">and there and so until there are a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.540" end="00:35:35.890" style="s2">predominance of investors who care more</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.030" end="00:35:37.150" style="s2">about the provision of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.890" end="00:35:38.619" style="s2">transportation service than they do</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.150" end="00:35:39.670" style="s2">about profits they go I mean they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.619" end="00:35:43.319" style="s2">still going to make profit out of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.670" end="00:35:43.319" style="s2">other company right but not as much</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.710" end="00:35:49.690" style="s2">investors willing to do that to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.119" end="00:35:50.859" style="s2">that hit if you like then Company B</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.690" end="00:35:54.250" style="s2">always wins</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.859" end="00:35:56.200" style="s2">but no because company a always wins not</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.250" end="00:35:58.150" style="s2">enter the game a paradigm where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.200" end="00:35:59.559" style="s2">looking for investors right you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.150" end="00:36:01.720" style="s2">they&#39;re always gonna pick the second one</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.559" end="00:36:03.880" style="s2">but if what you&#39;re looking for is to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.720" end="00:36:06.010" style="s2">optimize for the customer and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.880" end="00:36:09.010" style="s2">customers the investor they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.010" end="00:36:11.650" style="s2">gonna pick the first one so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.010" end="00:36:13.150" style="s2">dependent on our entire systems built on</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.650" end="00:36:14.920" style="s2">bankers and all they don&#39;t I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.150" end="00:36:17.020" style="s2">investors don&#39;t they have the money to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.920" end="00:36:18.730" style="s2">invest all these things but in actuality</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.020" end="00:36:21.250" style="s2">this is the difference being top down</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.730" end="00:36:23.950" style="s2">like you have money and privilege so is</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.250" end="00:36:26.829" style="s2">my idea okay versus hey let&#39;s optimize</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.950" end="00:36:28.660" style="s2">for transportation it&#39;s optimized to</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.829" end="00:36:30.970" style="s2">have it the best experience well of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.660" end="00:36:32.829" style="s2">course still maintaining profitability</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.970" end="00:36:37.359" style="s2">in that we need the resources we need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.829" end="00:36:41.829" style="s2">be able to maintaining this and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.359" end="00:36:44.740" style="s2">came up for me is you know there&#39;s again</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.829" end="00:36:47.950" style="s2">what you know what we&#39;re optimizing for</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.740" end="00:36:49.809" style="s2">like I I was talking to a friend the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.950" end="00:36:52.119" style="s2">other day and you know there&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.809" end="00:36:55.900" style="s2">question of you know I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.119" end="00:36:58.180" style="s2">which Native American community but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.900" end="00:37:00.930" style="s2">like is this the best decision for me</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.180" end="00:37:05.589" style="s2">and for the next seven generations and</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.930" end="00:37:08.950" style="s2">there&#39;s this relationship between you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.589" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">know making a decision that&#39;s optimal</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.950" end="00:37:16.569" style="s2">for me and an optimal and optimal for me</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.690" end="00:37:17.890" style="s2">in the future and I think that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.569" end="00:37:22.119" style="s2">the things that we haven&#39;t talked about</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.890" end="00:37:27.250" style="s2">the Jordan Peterson talks about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.119" end="00:37:31.480" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a thing in mice where</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.250" end="00:37:32.369" style="s2">mice will if they&#39;re there are two mice</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.480" end="00:37:33.809" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.369" end="00:37:36.539" style="s2">percent bigger than the other will win</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.809" end="00:37:40.289" style="s2">every time but if he doesn&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.539" end="00:37:42.390" style="s2">smaller what rap win 30% of the time the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.289" end="00:37:45.779" style="s2">smaller rat will stop playing so the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.390" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">larger rat will actually buy you know in</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.779" end="00:37:53.249" style="s2">his neural circuitry let the smaller rat</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:55.140" style="s2">win 30% of the time because that ensures</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.249" end="00:37:58.380" style="s2">that he gets to play to the game over</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.140" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">the long run and so what you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.380" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">optimizing not just for what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:06.299" style="s2">now but optimizing for what is the game</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">that we can continue playing you know or</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.299" end="00:38:11.279" style="s2">where all of the you know over you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:13.079" style="s2">not just the short run you know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.279" end="00:38:16.380" style="s2">what helps me to win not just in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.079" end="00:38:20.430" style="s2">short run but in the long run - and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.380" end="00:38:24.089" style="s2">think we it&#39;s we&#39;ve lost the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.430" end="00:38:25.470" style="s2">have that perspective and so I don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.089" end="00:38:29.819" style="s2">know I don&#39;t necessarily think that like</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.470" end="00:38:32.549" style="s2">that our I don&#39;t want there&#39;s part of me</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.819" end="00:38:34.799" style="s2">that wants to say we are our values are</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.549" end="00:38:37.380" style="s2">distorted but I think it&#39;s more of we</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.799" end="00:38:39.900" style="s2">lost the ability to have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.380" end="00:38:41.849" style="s2">perspective that those multiple</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.900" end="00:38:47.640" style="s2">perspectives with the short term and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.849" end="00:38:51.509" style="s2">long term yeah and how do you and how do</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.640" end="00:38:54.779" style="s2">you encourage that being able to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.509" end="00:38:56.700" style="s2">that those perspectives yeah he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.779" end="00:38:57.779" style="s2">the the problem is care and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.700" end="00:38:59.369" style="s2">saying that this is right I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.779" end="00:39:01.140" style="s2">saying this is the thinking this this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.369" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re saying right is</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.140" end="00:39:05.009" style="s2">that the long weather the long future is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:07.069" style="s2">uncertain I can&#39;t really predict that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.009" end="00:39:09.720" style="s2">but I can predict that if I take this</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.069" end="00:39:11.069" style="s2">exploit this affection now then my bonus</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.720" end="00:39:12.420" style="s2">checking three months time is going to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.069" end="00:39:15.450" style="s2">be a fat one you know what I mean and</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.420" end="00:39:18.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the primary motivated</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.450" end="00:39:20.789" style="s2">those incentives have to somehow be</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.480" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">neutralized I have no idea how you go</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.789" end="00:39:24.329" style="s2">about doing that but those those</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:26.930" style="s2">incentives to focus entirely on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.329" end="00:39:29.220" style="s2">short-term gain at the expense of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.930" end="00:39:30.569" style="s2">expense of the long term I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.220" end="00:39:32.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a really nice thing yeah not just</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.569" end="00:39:33.900" style="s2">what&#39;s not worth worth to there but</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.130" end="00:39:35.309" style="s2">what&#39;s right for seven generate for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.900" end="00:39:37.829" style="s2">next seven generations I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.309" end="00:39:39.509" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good source of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.829" end="00:39:41.099" style="s2">perspective to have in mind when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.509" end="00:39:43.289" style="s2">taking major decisions about things</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.099" end="00:39:45.299" style="s2">right you know not that you can with any</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.289" end="00:39:45.750" style="s2">accuracy predict seven generations down</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.299" end="00:39:49.590" style="s2">the road</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.750" end="00:39:52.500" style="s2">right but at least having that front and</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.590" end="00:39:54.270" style="s2">say you know it is this likely to have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.500" end="00:39:55.770" style="s2">near person adverse impact on my</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.270" end="00:39:57.750" style="s2">great-great-grandchildren sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.770" end="00:39:59.430" style="s2">you know and and and and catch it in</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.750" end="00:40:02.280" style="s2">those personal terms right how is it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.430" end="00:40:05.670" style="s2">going to affect my descendants you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.280" end="00:40:07.230" style="s2">yeah or me in the future I machine in</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.670" end="00:40:09.180" style="s2">ten years and I can visit myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.230" end="00:40:09.870" style="s2">future how&#39;s it going to affect me in</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.180" end="00:40:11.670" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.870" end="00:40:12.840" style="s2">I&#39;m really sorry bro but one more point</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.670" end="00:40:14.220" style="s2">to make which is just popped into my</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.840" end="00:40:16.230" style="s2">head along these lines I can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.220" end="00:40:18.330" style="s2">what the Philosopher&#39;s name is he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.230" end="00:40:20.460" style="s2">quite an obscure one his name may come</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.330" end="00:40:21.630" style="s2">to me but his basic thing was it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.460" end="00:40:25.380" style="s2">really nice idea</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.630" end="00:40:28.170" style="s2">imagine that you haven&#39;t been born yet</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.380" end="00:40:29.850" style="s2">right and the circumstances of your</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.170" end="00:40:32.520" style="s2">birth are entirely random you have no</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.850" end="00:40:34.350" style="s2">way of knowing which country you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.520" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">in what family you&#39;re going to be born</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.350" end="00:40:37.980" style="s2">in and what the circumstances are you</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:41.490" style="s2">going to be born you have no idea how</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.980" end="00:40:44.040" style="s2">would you organize a world based on that</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.490" end="00:40:46.020" style="s2">starting point that&#39;s funny because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.040" end="00:40:47.700" style="s2">was just about to say that even if I</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.020" end="00:40:51.230" style="s2">don&#39;t fully believe in it like I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.700" end="00:40:53.730" style="s2">stake my I believe in reincarnation and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.230" end="00:40:55.520" style="s2">reincarnation me means you optimize for</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.730" end="00:40:57.690" style="s2">that right there&#39;s people believe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.520" end="00:40:58.920" style="s2">coordinated in the same family I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:00.390" style="s2">if I believe in it I don&#39;t believe that</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.920" end="00:41:02.610" style="s2">I believe I more likely be reincarnated</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.390" end="00:41:05.490" style="s2">in China or India based on population</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.610" end="00:41:08.280" style="s2">size so how do i optimize for the global</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.490" end="00:41:10.500" style="s2">community not just me and my offspring</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.280" end="00:41:13.230" style="s2">because quite frankly as much money as i</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.500" end="00:41:14.850" style="s2">could amass my kids could squander it</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.230" end="00:41:16.200" style="s2">away and that happens time and time</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.850" end="00:41:17.640" style="s2">again it&#39;s like so let&#39;s get</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.200" end="00:41:20.010" style="s2">billionaires that my kids will never</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.640" end="00:41:21.120" style="s2">starve when seven generations from now</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.010" end="00:41:23.670" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to be tied to your</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.120" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">wealth at all whereas we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.670" end="00:41:28.380" style="s2">world that actually functions for</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:30.990" style="s2">everyone and then it optimizes for your</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.380" end="00:41:34.170" style="s2">best benefit and for the global best</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.990" end="00:41:36.150" style="s2">benefit without needing by playing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.170" end="00:41:38.130" style="s2">infinite game by saying yes I could be</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.150" end="00:41:42.200" style="s2">that person because they all we are all</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.130" end="00:41:42.200" style="s2">the same I am that person right now</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.930" end="00:41:56.369" style="s2">and how I come I always come back to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.060" end="00:41:59.130" style="s2">question of you know I have a similar</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.369" end="00:42:01.170" style="s2">ever similar canoe Jubilee but I know</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.130" end="00:42:03.060" style="s2">people who do not believe in</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.170" end="00:42:04.710" style="s2">reincarnation and believe that this life</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.060" end="00:42:06.840" style="s2">is the only one you&#39;ve got and you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.710" end="00:42:11.420" style="s2">got to make the best of it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.840" end="00:42:14.510" style="s2">optimize you know they don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.420" end="00:42:20.490" style="s2">perspective you know they don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.510" end="00:42:24.900" style="s2">they&#39;re not capable of seeing that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.490" end="00:42:27.630" style="s2">not from a not from a like I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.900" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">that as in a derogatory term I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.630" end="00:42:32.340" style="s2">one of the thing with rebel wisdom over</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:35.040" style="s2">the weekend and Diane who show Hamilton</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.340" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">what she talked about is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.040" end="00:42:41.369" style="s2">some people in her mediation that she</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:43.619" style="s2">comes across a mediation where she</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.369" end="00:42:45.900" style="s2">realizes they&#39;re not capable of taking</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.619" end="00:42:48.150" style="s2">other people&#39;s perspective they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.900" end="00:42:51.330" style="s2">not emotionally developed enough to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.150" end="00:42:54.210" style="s2">able to do that and so have you know how</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.330" end="00:42:55.859" style="s2">do you account for those right now I</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.210" end="00:42:58.560" style="s2">think what we do is we put most of those</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.859" end="00:43:01.800" style="s2">people we&#39;ve worked we put a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:04.770" style="s2">in jail and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.800" end="00:43:07.730" style="s2">answer so how do we accommodate how do</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.770" end="00:43:10.260" style="s2">we accommodate for people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.730" end="00:43:12.840" style="s2">emotionally or mentally developed enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.260" end="00:43:16.980" style="s2">to take that perspective and and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.840" end="00:43:18.510" style="s2">encourage that and that&#39;s where Eric&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.980" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">wording on the philosopher is a much</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.510" end="00:43:21.960" style="s2">better than first we have to instilled</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.250" end="00:43:23.250" style="s2">in court reincarnation do you believe in</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.960" end="00:43:26.190" style="s2">that because there&#39;s all the religion</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.250" end="00:43:28.050" style="s2">stuff associated with that right and but</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.190" end="00:43:30.180" style="s2">there is a philosopher and I also do not</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.050" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">remember the name pump the person but</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.180" end="00:43:33.210" style="s2">the concept Eric is talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:37.050" style="s2">like the veil of ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.210" end="00:43:39.510" style="s2">so you intellectually take on the veil</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.050" end="00:43:42.030" style="s2">of ignorance to say I don&#39;t know where I</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.510" end="00:43:43.859" style="s2">fit in society we&#39;re gonna let&#39;s say we</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.030" end="00:43:46.440" style="s2">take a member of like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.859" end="00:43:48.000" style="s2">different classes in society and you put</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.440" end="00:43:50.070" style="s2">them in a room and they know how society</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.000" end="00:43:51.570" style="s2">works but they don&#39;t actually know what</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.070" end="00:43:54.060" style="s2">part they fit in they don&#39;t know whether</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.570" end="00:43:55.680" style="s2">they&#39;re poor or rich they don&#39;t know so</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.060" end="00:43:57.410" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re eliminating their</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.680" end="00:43:58.850" style="s2">individual portion to</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.410" end="00:43:59.900" style="s2">side on what&#39;s best for the group you</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.850" end="00:44:01.670" style="s2">don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going back into</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.900" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">we can&#39;t actually do that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.670" end="00:44:06.020" style="s2">Doctor Who episode where they did that</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:07.130" style="s2">but there was like two warring factions</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.020" end="00:44:08.420" style="s2">and they&#39;ve got the leaders together</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.130" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">ever like but you don&#39;t know which side</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.420" end="00:44:12.260" style="s2">you&#39;re on you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.190" end="00:44:13.760" style="s2">and uh you know it&#39;d be like the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.260" end="00:44:15.500" style="s2">Palestinian Palestinians and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:17.420" style="s2">Israelis getting together and being like</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.500" end="00:44:20.120" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m Israeli or</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.420" end="00:44:22.760" style="s2">Palestinian what am I going to decide on</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.120" end="00:44:25.850" style="s2">this right not knowing what worldview</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.760" end="00:44:26.840" style="s2">step out to once you you remove yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.850" end="00:44:28.490" style="s2">from the room something there&#39;s a way to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.840" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">have but some people won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.490" end="00:44:34.430" style="s2">intellectually capable of that for sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:36.410" style="s2">right well and so the thought that came</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.430" end="00:44:42.290" style="s2">up as you&#39;re saying that is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.410" end="00:44:45.380" style="s2">have an example of I think any tune or</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.290" end="00:44:49.670" style="s2">you know a culture that tried to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.380" end="00:44:51.950" style="s2">implement something and I think it gone</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.670" end="00:44:55.490" style="s2">horribly wrong and that by that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.950" end="00:44:58.670" style="s2">the caste system in India like okay you</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.490" end="00:45:01.850" style="s2">you were born into this and so clearly</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.670" end="00:45:03.980" style="s2">that means that you can&#39;t you know like</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.850" end="00:45:07.610" style="s2">you have these let like that means you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.980" end="00:45:12.850" style="s2">have these lessons to learn yeah and but</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.610" end="00:45:16.850" style="s2">I there&#39;s serious problems with it and</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.850" end="00:45:18.740" style="s2">there&#39;s also you know some wisdom in</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.850" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">that there are people that are at</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.740" end="00:45:27.740" style="s2">different different ages and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:34.910" style="s2">accommodate for those but yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.740" end="00:45:37.310" style="s2">think yeah it&#39;s know for me it is just</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.910" end="00:45:41.030" style="s2">and just it&#39;s hard to actually implement</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.310" end="00:45:43.520" style="s2">but like if this kind of human being</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.030" end="00:45:45.800" style="s2">exists we have to make room for them</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">yeah and so there&#39;s a ton of people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.800" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">society that I might not want to exist</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:51.980" style="s2">but they exist</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:53.570" style="s2">so either we talk about we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.980" end="00:45:56.750" style="s2">talking about which is annihilating all</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.570" end="00:45:58.340" style="s2">of them or we need to allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.750" end="00:45:59.810" style="s2">exist and I&#39;m not talking about races</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.340" end="00:46:01.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no race that I have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.810" end="00:46:03.080" style="s2">with but like there&#39;s certain people</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.400" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">were like well they just know they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.080" end="00:46:08.360" style="s2">exist right and so our option is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:10.450" style="s2">imprison them even if they haven&#39;t done</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.360" end="00:46:11.980" style="s2">anything wrong or just like bleep</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.450" end="00:46:13.300" style="s2">out of existence like no they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.980" end="00:46:15.609" style="s2">not allowed to exist because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.300" end="00:46:18.040" style="s2">allowed done for more in Australia</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.609" end="00:46:22.540" style="s2">that&#39;s what we used to do we go we need</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.040" end="00:46:24.040" style="s2">a new Australia I know but that is part</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.540" end="00:46:28.900" style="s2">of it is possibly because that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.040" end="00:46:29.980" style="s2">same as like saying you don&#39;t get to sit</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.900" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">at my tip you don&#39;t get to sit at any</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.980" end="00:46:32.710" style="s2">table or saying well you can go find</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:34.329" style="s2">your own table but I&#39;m gonna make sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.710" end="00:46:37.030" style="s2">you can&#39;t sit at any of them isn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.329" end="00:46:39.640" style="s2">the same thing and so that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.030" end="00:46:41.619" style="s2">different is our strength but requiring</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.640" end="00:46:44.230" style="s2">everyone see it that way isn&#39;t honoring</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.619" end="00:46:45.849" style="s2">our differences like allowing for true</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.230" end="00:46:47.079" style="s2">diversity means allowing for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.849" end="00:46:49.540" style="s2">diversity that doesn&#39;t allow for</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.079" end="00:46:51.970" style="s2">diversity without it breaking diversity</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.540" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">yeah allowing people to be their mental</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.970" end="00:46:55.660" style="s2">state which you know racism sexism</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:58.060" style="s2">homophobia sometimes in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.660" end="00:47:00.520" style="s2">sometimes overall you still get to exist</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.060" end="00:47:02.650" style="s2">because you exist right how do we work</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.520" end="00:47:04.180" style="s2">with that yeah you&#39;ve also got to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.650" end="00:47:05.800" style="s2">room to get away from people to drive</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.180" end="00:47:06.849" style="s2">you mad day because sooner or later if</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.800" end="00:47:08.140" style="s2">you&#39;re around people that drive you mad</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.849" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">all the time sooner or later you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.140" end="00:47:10.810" style="s2">gonna snap right you&#39;re gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:16.140" style="s2">something you regret and you can take</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.810" end="00:47:16.140" style="s2">back so yeah you do need retreat space</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.349" end="00:47:25.060" style="s2">like this counter balancing system that</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:29.190" style="s2">I hope we&#39;re trying to create actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.060" end="00:47:32.020" style="s2">does as a part of its functioning is</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.190" end="00:47:35.319" style="s2">trying to teach people to see from</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.020" end="00:47:40.750" style="s2">different angles and really values our</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.319" end="00:47:42.910" style="s2">differences in ways that is a more</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.750" end="00:47:44.650" style="s2">personal it&#39;s not like top down I value</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.910" end="00:47:47.410" style="s2">you if you&#39;re this way it&#39;s like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.650" end="00:47:49.599" style="s2">inside out like I value these parts of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.410" end="00:47:51.220" style="s2">myself and now I can share them more</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:53.319" style="s2">with you because I see that you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.220" end="00:47:55.690" style="s2">something similar or something different</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.319" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">then I can share my side so starting to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.690" end="00:48:01.780" style="s2">value those that consciousness like</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:04.810" style="s2">conscious living conscious connections</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.780" end="00:48:06.700" style="s2">conscious affect on each other by</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.810" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">recognizing that and teaching people how</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.700" end="00:48:11.859" style="s2">to do that I think we elevate everybody</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:13.810" style="s2">instead of saying oh I need to separate</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.859" end="00:48:16.290" style="s2">this part of society because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.810" end="00:48:19.450" style="s2">different I think it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.290" end="00:48:22.829" style="s2">connective sharing informational thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.450" end="00:48:24.250" style="s2">instead of separating so it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.829" end="00:48:27.340" style="s2">inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.250" end="00:48:29.950" style="s2">I guess but valuing it so we realized</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.340" end="00:48:35.099" style="s2">like there is value in our capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.950" end="00:48:35.099" style="s2">our ability to respond because of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.340" end="00:48:42.990" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m reminded of conversations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.430" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">like there&#39;s also how do you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.990" end="00:48:51.210" style="s2">the how do you deal with the people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:54.220" style="s2">have personality disorders so the narcs</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.210" end="00:48:56.109" style="s2">narcissistic psychopathic sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.220" end="00:49:00.220" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be some percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.109" end="00:49:02.859" style="s2">those that are that&#39;s that is influenced</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.220" end="00:49:05.230" style="s2">by nature or by nurture but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.859" end="00:49:08.340" style="s2">also some percentage of them that where</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.230" end="00:49:11.770" style="s2">they&#39;re you know there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.340" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2">fundamental issue with their DN you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.770" end="00:49:19.810" style="s2">with like it&#39;s not something that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:22.270" style="s2">can educate them out of and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.810" end="00:49:30.099" style="s2">how do you build a system like her that</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.270" end="00:49:33.790" style="s2">I know so I agree with I either I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.099" end="00:49:36.310" style="s2">have I would have agreed with you guys a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.790" end="00:49:38.530" style="s2">couple of years ago and there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.310" end="00:49:42.420" style="s2">few experiences in my life that have</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.530" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">have changed my perspective on that</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.420" end="00:49:48.369" style="s2">there&#39;s just a grand sense you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:50.560" style="s2">make sense of biology independently of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.369" end="00:49:54.040" style="s2">environment it just makes no sense right</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.560" end="00:49:56.020" style="s2">biology is a dynamic interplay of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.040" end="00:49:57.640" style="s2">organic matter with its environment you</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.020" end="00:50:00.700" style="s2">know what I mean that that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.640" end="00:50:02.859" style="s2">it is and so to say that something is</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.700" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">genetic is essentially giving up right</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.859" end="00:50:05.650" style="s2">it can&#39;t be fixed you&#39;re stuck with it</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:07.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the we do</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.650" end="00:50:10.450" style="s2">that&#39;s it it&#39;s unchangeable it&#39;s set in</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.540" end="00:50:12.640" style="s2">stone forever and and and there&#39;s yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.450" end="00:50:14.349" style="s2">listen I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t had your</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.640" end="00:50:15.970" style="s2">experiences in life right Kiera so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.349" end="00:50:17.410" style="s2">know maybe if I&#39;d had your experiences</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.970" end="00:50:19.599" style="s2">I&#39;d feel very differently there you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.410" end="00:50:21.940" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s very but then that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.599" end="00:50:24.609" style="s2">is also an argument in favor of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.940" end="00:50:26.470" style="s2">environmental impact on one&#39;s behavior</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.609" end="00:50:27.880" style="s2">and perceptions right you know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.470" end="00:50:29.650" style="s2">experiences that you have had have led</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.880" end="00:50:31.869" style="s2">you to conviction which you hold very</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.650" end="00:50:33.460" style="s2">strongly the absence of my having had</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.869" end="00:50:35.140" style="s2">those experiences all that having ever</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.460" end="00:50:37.300" style="s2">had different experiences led me to a</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.140" end="00:50:38.020" style="s2">very very different equally strongly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.300" end="00:50:41.290" style="s2">held convey</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.020" end="00:50:43.810" style="s2">right so yeah it&#39;s very interesting well</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.290" end="00:50:45.670" style="s2">I think both I think that there&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.810" end="00:50:47.770" style="s2">nature and nurture involved in</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.670" end="00:50:51.730" style="s2">personality disorders I think our</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.770" end="00:50:54.130" style="s2">society both if you had any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.730" end="00:50:55.510" style="s2">genetic and it predisposition it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.130" end="00:50:57.010" style="s2">to basically force you in that direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.510" end="00:50:58.210" style="s2">because it&#39;s profitable to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.010" end="00:51:01.420" style="s2">narcissist its profitable to be a</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.210" end="00:51:03.820" style="s2">psychopath or sociopath and so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.420" end="00:51:05.560" style="s2">society set up to actually help elevate</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.820" end="00:51:07.210" style="s2">those people I don&#39;t think doing the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.560" end="00:51:09.400" style="s2">opposite and vilifying all of them is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.210" end="00:51:10.660" style="s2">the answer I think that in a society</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.400" end="00:51:12.280" style="s2">where we are more connected and there</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.660" end="00:51:14.170" style="s2">everyone has access to their emotional</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.280" end="00:51:16.510" style="s2">and physical needs met you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.170" end="00:51:19.360" style="s2">way less of them it&#39;ll never reach zero</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.510" end="00:51:22.510" style="s2">and I again then we have to say if these</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.360" end="00:51:25.690" style="s2">people exist where is their place in</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.510" end="00:51:28.060" style="s2">society because my guess is we have it</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.690" end="00:51:29.890" style="s2">for an evolutionary real reason we just</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.060" end="00:51:31.990" style="s2">don&#39;t need the number of them right like</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.890" end="00:51:34.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a real need for sociopaths</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.990" end="00:51:36.970" style="s2">and nurses even if I can&#39;t see it and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.900" end="00:51:39.190" style="s2">allowing that and I don&#39;t need to have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.970" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">relationship with a narcissist I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.190" end="00:51:42.820" style="s2">and I don&#39;t need to feel bad about now</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:45.220" style="s2">Peter like Gemma narcissus and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.820" end="00:51:49.300" style="s2">I&#39;m not someone who brings a narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.220" end="00:51:51.370" style="s2">in my life and other people do and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.300" end="00:51:53.320" style="s2">sucks right that they kept narcissists</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.370" end="00:51:54.970" style="s2">after narcissists after narcissists and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.320" end="00:51:56.500" style="s2">then those people are also ones who</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.970" end="00:51:59.770" style="s2">label every what is it or it&#39;s like we</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.500" end="00:52:03.160" style="s2">all have a piece of it in us and to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.770" end="00:52:04.960" style="s2">able to create society that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.160" end="00:52:07.000" style="s2">cost to be in that way as opposed to a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.960" end="00:52:09.370" style="s2">benefit to being that way and the cost</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.000" end="00:52:11.050" style="s2">can just that we can see you right we</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.370" end="00:52:12.520" style="s2">can see that you&#39;re going from person to</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.050" end="00:52:15.670" style="s2">person and feeding off of them with your</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.520" end="00:52:19.030" style="s2">narcissistic energy that&#39;s more evident</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.670" end="00:52:20.320" style="s2">and and therefore they&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.030" end="00:52:22.570" style="s2">less impact because that&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.320" end="00:52:26.050" style="s2">narcissist generally does is go in and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.570" end="00:52:27.190" style="s2">change the let they go and they feed off</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.050" end="00:52:28.480" style="s2">of you until they&#39;ve pissed you off and</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.190" end="00:52:30.040" style="s2">off you either walk away or they keep</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.480" end="00:52:31.510" style="s2">they keep keeping you there then they go</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.040" end="00:52:32.770" style="s2">on to someone else once you stop feeding</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.510" end="00:52:34.900" style="s2">them they&#39;re gonna go on to someone else</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.770" end="00:52:37.090" style="s2">someone else if you can see that pattern</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.900" end="00:52:38.590" style="s2">even if they can&#39;t you&#39;re like every</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.090" end="00:52:40.990" style="s2">group you&#39;re a part of you see this hang</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.590" end="00:52:43.270" style="s2">out for six months and then nothing then</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.990" end="00:52:44.770" style="s2">there&#39;s more trust built into it and</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.270" end="00:52:46.150" style="s2">then we don&#39;t cuz otherwise you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.770" end="00:52:48.070" style="s2">around with like narcissists radar and</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.150" end="00:52:49.750" style="s2">everyone&#39;s a narcissist which costs you</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.070" end="00:52:51.790" style="s2">more than it costs them right because</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.750" end="00:52:56.200" style="s2">you&#39;ve encountered it off of them you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.790" end="00:52:59.140" style="s2">see them everywhere and I still think</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.200" end="00:53:02.590" style="s2">I&#39;m coke because I do know of some I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.140" end="00:53:05.470" style="s2">have a narcissist in my family who has</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.590" end="00:53:08.800" style="s2">finally at like if he&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.470" end="00:53:10.780" style="s2">realized this about himself and is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.800" end="00:53:12.910" style="s2">trying I know it&#39;s very challenging for</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.780" end="00:53:15.640" style="s2">him but he&#39;s trying very hard to do a</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.910" end="00:53:20.110" style="s2">lot of self work and going to these</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.640" end="00:53:21.490" style="s2">workshops retreats he&#39;s still it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.110" end="00:53:23.800" style="s2">challenging for him but at least he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.490" end="00:53:25.570" style="s2">trying to break out of that realizes</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.800" end="00:53:33.610" style="s2">that that&#39;s why his life sucks is</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.570" end="00:53:36.190" style="s2">because of himself and I&#39;m very amazed</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.610" end="00:53:38.890" style="s2">that he&#39;s even stepping into that area</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.190" end="00:53:42.280" style="s2">I&#39;m very proud and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.890" end="00:53:45.010" style="s2">easy but it makes me hopeful for other</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.280" end="00:53:52.450" style="s2">people if they can get there I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.010" end="00:53:54.640" style="s2">support is huge if that&#39;s like the one</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.450" end="00:53:56.680" style="s2">pointing characteristic narcissist as</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.640" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">they can&#39;t even if proven they can&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.680" end="00:54:00.550" style="s2">themselves as narcissist</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:02.440" style="s2">so matters that weird we were part of it</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.550" end="00:54:05.260" style="s2">yeah he probably wouldn&#39;t call himself</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.440" end="00:54:09.910" style="s2">that but he is realizing wow I&#39;m a real</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.260" end="00:54:16.930" style="s2">ass and around me and I don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.910" end="00:54:18.550" style="s2">for the rest of my life you know yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.930" end="00:54:20.980" style="s2">like Jubilee said it&#39;s in all of us</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.550" end="00:54:23.670" style="s2">right I mean I I&#39;m well aware of my</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.980" end="00:54:26.380" style="s2">narcissistic tendencies you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.670" end="00:54:28.450" style="s2">and they&#39;re not insignificant and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.380" end="00:54:32.050" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not a binary condition right</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.450" end="00:54:33.430" style="s2">and I think again as Jubilee said Italy</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.050" end="00:54:35.950" style="s2">there&#39;s at least a little part of it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.430" end="00:54:37.720" style="s2">all of us right and so we should be able</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.950" end="00:54:39.490" style="s2">to find some common ground with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.720" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">out-and-out narcissists right and be</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.490" end="00:54:43.660" style="s2">able to have a laugh with them and even</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:44.920" style="s2">if they don&#39;t realize we&#39;re laughing at</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.660" end="00:54:46.360" style="s2">them they can be a great source of</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.920" end="00:54:48.370" style="s2">entertainment if you you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.360" end="00:54:50.260" style="s2">don&#39;t take it all too seriously don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.370" end="00:54:53.740" style="s2">see it as a threat to yourself in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.260" end="00:54:57.070" style="s2">way or another you know see as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.740" end="00:54:59.740" style="s2">you know healthy a healthy population is</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.070" end="00:55:02.290" style="s2">well aware of these traits in some</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.740" end="00:55:04.060" style="s2">people right and just don&#39;t as you say</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.290" end="00:55:05.970" style="s2">don&#39;t feed them right and if they stop</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.060" end="00:55:08.349" style="s2">getting fed then</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.970" end="00:55:19.809" style="s2">their emotional feeding we should</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.349" end="00:55:21.490" style="s2">definitely be actually view and behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.809" end="00:55:24.130" style="s2">is gonna starve it is gonna starve to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.490" end="00:55:26.020" style="s2">death right you know eventually you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.130" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">over over several generations in an</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.020" end="00:55:32.700" style="s2">actual healthy society where you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:36.460" style="s2">nobody really wanted for anything of</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.700" end="00:55:39.069" style="s2">serious consequence then all that I</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.460" end="00:55:41.220" style="s2">really really believe all that goes</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.069" end="00:55:44.140" style="s2">away so much as a signs of human nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.220" end="00:55:47.890" style="s2">you know greed and narcissism and</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.140" end="00:55:50.440" style="s2">violence and you know ugly competitive</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.890" end="00:55:52.599" style="s2">Bo that the the stamping on people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.440" end="00:55:53.710" style="s2">head in victory sort of sort of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.599" end="00:55:57.640" style="s2">I just</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.710" end="00:55:59.710" style="s2">IIIi absolutely believe that all of this</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.640" end="00:56:01.390" style="s2">is drawn out of us of course the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.710" end="00:56:03.309" style="s2">capacity for it exist in as we see</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.390" end="00:56:05.290" style="s2">around us every day right there is there</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.309" end="00:56:09.490" style="s2">is no argument with that but but I I</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.290" end="00:56:11.890" style="s2">remain deeply convinced that the</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.490" end="00:56:13.630" style="s2">circumstances of our environment draw</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.890" end="00:56:15.910" style="s2">that out of us and you change those</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.630" end="00:56:17.500" style="s2">circumstances and it draws different</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.910" end="00:56:20.170" style="s2">things out of us you know we have the</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.500" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">capacity we are unbelievably plastic and</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.170" end="00:56:23.740" style="s2">malleable</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:26.260" style="s2">in in in in the in the behaviors that we</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.740" end="00:56:28.690" style="s2">can exhibit right and they are almost</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.260" end="00:56:31.299" style="s2">entirely driven by what we witness</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.690" end="00:56:33.369" style="s2">around us and we emulate that right you</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.299" end="00:56:36.099" style="s2">change that environment you change what</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.369" end="00:56:41.410" style="s2">comes out I I don&#39;t think I could be</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.099" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">dissuaded from that view and where does</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.410" end="00:56:48.250" style="s2">our evolution play in that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:50.170" style="s2">about individuals is it evolution is</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.250" end="00:56:53.410" style="s2">about eCos is not even about species</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.170" end="00:56:55.329" style="s2">it&#39;s about ecosystems yeah the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.410" end="00:56:56.920" style="s2">which has the most effective feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.329" end="00:56:59.530" style="s2">loops and balancing mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.920" end="00:57:01.960" style="s2">repair systems and so on survive and all</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.530" end="00:57:04.869" style="s2">the members of that ecosystem benefit</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.960" end="00:57:08.260" style="s2">from the survival and evolution of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.869" end="00:57:09.760" style="s2">ecosystem the the whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.260" end="00:57:12.010" style="s2">survival of the fittest apart at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.760" end="00:57:14.319" style="s2">individual or even at the species level</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.010" end="00:57:16.599" style="s2">is actually kind of nonsensical you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.319" end="00:57:18.640" style="s2">doing it absent of the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.599" end="00:57:20.290" style="s2">ecosystem in which it exists</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.640" end="00:57:23.590" style="s2">can&#39;t do that the only thing that</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.290" end="00:57:26.920" style="s2">evolution really sensibly applies to is</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.590" end="00:57:31.300" style="s2">his ecosystems as a whole it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.920" end="00:57:34.170" style="s2">geneticist pretty much how Brett</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.300" end="00:57:36.250" style="s2">Weinstein sees not every cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.170" end="00:57:38.050" style="s2">Dawkins is like it&#39;s on the gene level</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.250" end="00:57:41.860" style="s2">right it&#39;s the final unit wants</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.050" end="00:57:43.300" style="s2">appropriate explain the explain the</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.860" end="00:57:44.980" style="s2">development of the fetus in the womb you</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.300" end="00:57:48.130" style="s2">know and explain these things from a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.980" end="00:57:49.420" style="s2"> list of letters I agree I think I</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.130" end="00:57:51.810" style="s2">got every level I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.420" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">ecosystem down to the G yeah I think you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.810" end="00:57:56.290" style="s2">go with the macro and the micro at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:58.930" style="s2">same time there you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.290" end="00:58:01.990" style="s2">individual gene expression that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.930" end="00:58:06.420" style="s2">to mutate and you&#39;re going to have large</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.990" end="00:58:09.070" style="s2">you know means mutate all at every level</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.420" end="00:58:10.570" style="s2">the organism level that gene will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.070" end="00:58:12.520" style="s2">expressed with that gene will be</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.570" end="00:58:14.470" style="s2">expressed or not expressed given the</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.520" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">circumstances of the environment and it</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.470" end="00:58:18.250" style="s2">will be advantageous or not advantageous</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:21.010" style="s2">given the circumstances of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.250" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">ecosystem in that moment right and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.010" end="00:58:25.060" style="s2">the evolution of the species and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:27.880" style="s2">individual only makes sense in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.060" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">context of the overall development of</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.880" end="00:58:30.940" style="s2">the ecosystem I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:34.180" style="s2">separate from it is part of it but but</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.940" end="00:58:36.940" style="s2">but the actual thing which is evolving</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.180" end="00:58:39.550" style="s2">is the ecosystem the rest are cells</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.940" end="00:58:41.260" style="s2">within that ecosystems evolution if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.550" end="00:58:43.600" style="s2">see what I mean and that is what I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.260" end="00:58:46.540" style="s2">our society is slightly needs to be in</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.600" end="00:58:48.790" style="s2">that right now humans we look at humans</p>

<p begin="00:58:48.790" end="00:58:53.530" style="s2">we really are are representations of all</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.250" end="00:58:55.720" style="s2">of the species like you can&#39;t all be</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.530" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">Tigers there&#39;s no one to eat right you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.720" end="00:58:59.830" style="s2">can all be narcissists there&#39;s no defeat</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:59:02.140" style="s2">other you can&#39;t all and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.830" end="00:59:04.630" style="s2">we still have even in biology like the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.140" end="00:59:06.250" style="s2">Tigers more evolved than the answer no</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.630" end="00:59:07.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not any more evolved they</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.250" end="00:59:09.430" style="s2">have been on the planet the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.540" end="00:59:11.290" style="s2">amount of time we are not more involved</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.430" end="00:59:14.020" style="s2">than the ends we have different</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.290" end="00:59:16.030" style="s2">functions and we don&#39;t get to say what</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.020" end="00:59:18.610" style="s2">those are we just are they are what they</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.030" end="00:59:21.040" style="s2">are right the ant can&#39;t be it can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.610" end="00:59:23.500" style="s2">cantaloupe either organs look we still</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.040" end="00:59:25.990" style="s2">like nearer individually ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.500" end="00:59:27.910" style="s2">we can&#39;t really be something else but we</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.990" end="00:59:29.410" style="s2">have one species that we prop up which</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.910" end="00:59:31.090" style="s2">is like the Tigers and the Lions and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.410" end="00:59:32.200" style="s2">Bears and like those ones are not the</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.090" end="00:59:34.150" style="s2">sustainable ones those</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.200" end="00:59:36.430" style="s2">our there&#39;s a reason there&#39;s so few of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.150" end="00:59:38.260" style="s2">them compared to the rest and yet when</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.430" end="00:59:40.840" style="s2">we tap into that we&#39;re truly our</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.260" end="00:59:43.540" style="s2">diversity helps us evolve the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.840" end="00:59:45.160" style="s2">that is how as it&#39;s one member of one</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.540" end="00:59:47.470" style="s2">species I can&#39;t be everything to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.160" end="00:59:50.290" style="s2">ecosystem it&#39;s impossible you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.470" end="00:59:52.210" style="s2">an ant and a bird and a tiger and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.290" end="00:59:53.620" style="s2">can only be one of those things and be</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.210" end="00:59:56.200" style="s2">part of the coast and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.620" end="01:00:00.220" style="s2">diversity helps us that&#39;s actually my</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.200" end="01:00:03.640" style="s2">background is film where they</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.220" end="01:00:04.980" style="s2">reintroduce the rules to this in I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.640" end="01:00:07.900" style="s2">remember where it was summer in America</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.980" end="01:00:12.490" style="s2">reintroduce and and the whole ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.900" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">just just it was it was miraculous it</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.490" end="01:00:16.480" style="s2">really was I mean it brings you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:18.070" style="s2">watch it and not be moved by it you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.480" end="01:00:19.600" style="s2">what I mean it was absolutely the most</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.070" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">beautiful thing so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.600" end="01:00:24.810" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of what I mean right</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:29.260" style="s2">whether the restored some balance to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.810" end="01:00:31.420" style="s2">ecosystem and the thriving of dozens</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.260" end="01:00:34.150" style="s2">hundreds of species comes about as a</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.420" end="01:00:37.000" style="s2">consequence of it right but it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.150" end="01:00:38.940" style="s2">ecosystem which is now private not this</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.000" end="01:00:41.950" style="s2">species in this piece in this CD but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.940" end="01:00:44.290" style="s2">that that organism the organism of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.950" end="01:00:45.790" style="s2">ecosystem has been reinvigorated and</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.290" end="01:00:48.730" style="s2">brought back to life and that brings</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.790" end="01:00:50.650" style="s2">with it all over all of the biodiversity</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.730" end="01:00:54.430" style="s2">and yet it&#39;s the individual who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.650" end="01:00:56.170" style="s2">competing and the individual that if</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.430" end="01:00:59.530" style="s2">they&#39;re active in their own</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.170" end="01:01:01.600" style="s2">self-interest and it still exists yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.530" end="01:01:07.990" style="s2">you don&#39;t like no Angela like you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.600" end="01:01:09.940" style="s2">no lion is like they&#39;re in their own</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.990" end="01:01:12.220" style="s2">self-interest and it still plays out</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.940" end="01:01:13.600" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s played by different</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.220" end="01:01:15.640" style="s2">rules then it doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.600" end="01:01:17.410" style="s2">selfish just live your life do your</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.640" end="01:01:18.820" style="s2">thing and I think that we are at the our</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.410" end="01:01:21.250" style="s2">marks it does anyone have any closing</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.820" end="01:01:22.930" style="s2">minute well I I need to respond to that</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.250" end="01:01:24.820" style="s2">because you can be as selfish as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.930" end="01:01:26.230" style="s2">like when you rely on right and if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.820" end="01:01:27.490" style="s2">eat all the antelopes then there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.230" end="01:01:29.290" style="s2">enough food to go around and most of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.490" end="01:01:30.910" style="s2">lions die away right and so either you</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.290" end="01:01:33.430" style="s2">can be a substitute you like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.910" end="01:01:35.140" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t apply to us right we</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.430" end="01:01:37.000" style="s2">can be as selfish as we like and there</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.140" end="01:01:38.920" style="s2">is no end to the continuation of</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.000" end="01:01:42.300" style="s2">extraction and refinement and alteration</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.920" end="01:01:44.800" style="s2">that we can do to keep us going</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.300" end="01:01:47.070" style="s2">Yujin Amin Lions can&#39;t do that they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.800" end="01:01:49.390" style="s2">they have natural</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.070" end="01:01:52.090" style="s2">Millenia we&#39;re coming to the end of that</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.390" end="01:01:55.000" style="s2">right there&#39;s pandemic all of it is like</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.090" end="01:01:56.050" style="s2">okay we ate all our Antelope not enough</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.000" end="01:01:57.730" style="s2">that we can figure out where other</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.050" end="01:01:59.800" style="s2">things are and eat those things but</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.730" end="01:02:01.690" style="s2">eventually we kind of have to figure it</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.800" end="01:02:02.920" style="s2">out on it like we can have lions and you</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.690" end="01:02:05.770" style="s2">can have these we can have that but we</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.920" end="01:02:07.630" style="s2">can&#39;t all be lions probably you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.770" end="01:02:09.730" style="s2">well and I just want to I wanted to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.630" end="01:02:12.070" style="s2">one quick thing Erik that the example of</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.730" end="01:02:15.330" style="s2">the wolves being introduced a predator</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.070" end="01:02:17.710" style="s2">brought balance to this district and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.330" end="01:02:19.450" style="s2">when I was bringing that question so</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.710" end="01:02:21.460" style="s2">when I was bringing that question about</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.450" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">people with personality disorders like</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.460" end="01:02:26.110" style="s2">sociopathy and psychopathy and our</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:28.540" style="s2">narcissism they&#39;re predators predators</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.110" end="01:02:30.640" style="s2">are needed as part of the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.540" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">there we go I like that yeah yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.640" end="01:02:35.620" style="s2">like that so so the ulema so you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.760" end="01:02:38.790" style="s2">that the idea of trying to create a</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.620" end="01:02:43.360" style="s2">society where we&#39;re eliminating that</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.790" end="01:02:45.100" style="s2">you&#39;re equating human society with an</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.360" end="01:02:46.750" style="s2">ecosystem though and the levels of</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.100" end="01:02:50.170" style="s2">complexity and feedback loop to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.750" end="01:02:52.270" style="s2">ecosystem far exceed those in human in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.170" end="01:02:57.400" style="s2">way it&#39;s a microcosm of but but but the</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.270" end="01:03:00.280" style="s2">the capacity for you know maintaining</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.400" end="01:03:03.040" style="s2">equilibrium is not as great obviously in</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.280" end="01:03:08.350" style="s2">human societies is in the system as a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.040" end="01:03:12.210" style="s2">whole but I was also good I would</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.350" end="01:03:15.190" style="s2">disagree with that not assertion that I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.210" end="01:03:18.520" style="s2">I can&#39;t go I can&#39;t go into the</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.190" end="01:03:20.410" style="s2">explanation but just your massive I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.520" end="01:03:23.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about 7 billion people on</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.410" end="01:03:26.950" style="s2">a planet and I mean yes there&#39;s a far</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.110" end="01:03:29.410" style="s2">greater number of bugs on the planet</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.950" end="01:03:32.470" style="s2">than there are humans but I just I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.410" end="01:03:34.360" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that&#39;s about relationships</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.470" end="01:03:36.430" style="s2">right the number of relationships that</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.360" end="01:03:39.730" style="s2">exist think about you know right from</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.430" end="01:03:42.070" style="s2">the sub microscopic tiny diatoms and and</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.730" end="01:03:43.720" style="s2">bacteria all of the relationships that</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.070" end="01:03:45.340" style="s2">exist between that not to mention all</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.720" end="01:03:48.070" style="s2">the plants and the fungi and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.340" end="01:03:49.720" style="s2">mycelial networks and and all of those</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.070" end="01:03:52.030" style="s2">work that exist right up to the top to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.720" end="01:03:53.110" style="s2">the apex predator right there that web</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.030" end="01:03:55.960" style="s2">of relationships</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.110" end="01:03:58.299" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine human society competes</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.960" end="01:04:01.119" style="s2">with that that in terms of can</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.299" end="01:04:05.319" style="s2">maybe I&#39;m wrong yeah but I don&#39;t see it</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.119" end="01:04:07.779" style="s2">personally we have to wrap it up they</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.319" end="01:04:11.519" style="s2">talk about ecosystem and economy all day</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.779" end="01:04:11.519" style="s2">maybe they&#39;ll be next week study a cafe</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.929" end="01:04:19.359" style="s2">I just want to make one quick thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.400" end="01:04:21.999" style="s2">about the wolves again and they were</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.359" end="01:04:26.829" style="s2">reintroduced and thrive the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.999" end="01:04:28.989" style="s2">ecosystem but then what happens men who</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.829" end="01:04:31.509" style="s2">need more money go out and use the</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.989" end="01:04:34.689" style="s2">wolves Robin works with us I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.509" end="01:04:39.029" style="s2">to make more money so that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.689" end="01:04:42.549" style="s2">happening fewer will again probably</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.029" end="01:04:44.459" style="s2">anyway sorry so little ecosystem yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.549" end="01:04:49.499" style="s2">all right well say goodbye to YouTube</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.459" end="01:04:49.499" style="s2">like you take your shadow</p>
