<p begin="00:00:29.510" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">it just felt not appropriate to give a</p>

<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:43.980" style="s2">right to give a quote that then might be</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.090" end="00:00:45.809" style="s2">taken out of context because I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.980" end="00:00:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna take us at least 40 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.809" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">and maybe more to really unpack it know</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.960" end="00:00:51.539" style="s2">you mentioned you work in the media I</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:55.860" style="s2">used to work in advertising as well so</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.539" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting moment for an ad</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.860" end="00:00:59.219" style="s2">to be this kind of cultural lightning</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:01.949" style="s2">rod</p>

<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:13.710" style="s2">phenomena to to observe yeah just for</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:16.950" style="s2">for the last couple of days I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.000" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">seen this I mean the amount of views</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.950" end="00:01:20.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s had it was up to about 9</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:22.920" style="s2">million views in a very short space of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.280" end="00:01:25.100" style="s2">time at two days hugely polarized</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.920" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">reactions it was running about 10 to 1</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.100" end="00:01:29.130" style="s2">dislikes to light ratio it&#39;s now up to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:31.829" style="s2">about four to one which we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.130" end="00:01:33.270" style="s2">later because that already some people</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.829" end="00:01:36.000" style="s2">are questioning whether that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.270" end="00:01:38.610" style="s2">completely authentic and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.000" end="00:01:41.430" style="s2">interesting I thought it was done in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.610" end="00:01:44.189" style="s2">way it&#39;s done very well because these</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.430" end="00:01:46.290" style="s2">things these huge amounts of budget</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.189" end="00:01:49.649" style="s2">behind it and it&#39;s very easy to get</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.290" end="00:01:51.360" style="s2">polarized into if you don&#39;t approve this</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.649" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">then you must be a sexist you must be a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.360" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">misogynist but you look at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">the response and either and there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:00.570" style="s2">some people that even I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">tweeting this is like whoa this was so</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.570" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">needed because look at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">response look at the level of there must</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:09.869" style="s2">be far more troglodytes misogynists out</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">there than we realise by the response to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.869" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">this film and that&#39;s really unfair</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:16.209" style="s2">but I think to unpack it properly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:18.610" style="s2">gonna take a little while to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.209" end="00:02:20.620" style="s2">cultural context to look at play a few</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.610" end="00:02:22.120" style="s2">clips from some of the people we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.620" end="00:02:23.920" style="s2">interviewed especially Warren Farrell</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.120" end="00:02:25.810" style="s2">because I think his perspective is</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.920" end="00:02:27.459" style="s2">really valuable in this in this point</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.810" end="00:02:31.120" style="s2">but let&#39;s let&#39;s start by talking about</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.459" end="00:02:35.650" style="s2">the film itself yes because it was done</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.120" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">by a very high-profile director Kim</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.650" end="00:02:42.610" style="s2">Gehrig so a female director who did a</p>

<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:51.549" style="s2">now and we&#39;ll just sort of then unpack</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.989" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">the differences and what it says about</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.549" end="00:02:58.329" style="s2">the cultural context Mississippi bring</p>

<p begin="00:03:09.680" end="00:03:13.070" style="s2">campaign it&#39;s actually by death by</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:15.380" style="s2">pretty much any definition was a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.070" end="00:03:18.140" style="s2">campaign it took a real need and a real</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.380" end="00:03:19.670" style="s2">issue which is women feeling like they</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.140" end="00:03:20.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to exercise because they</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.180" end="00:03:26.570" style="s2">about this about the kind of feeling</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.190" end="00:03:28.070" style="s2">especially like in the freeway section</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.570" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">of the gym like I really want to go in</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.070" end="00:03:32.690" style="s2">there so it took that need it did a</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.690" end="00:03:36.380" style="s2">something like well according to an</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.670" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2">award entry they did you know 1.6</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.380" end="00:03:40.820" style="s2">million women doing exercise</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:44.150" style="s2">attributable to some way in that to that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.820" end="00:03:45.860" style="s2">campaign which is great so really</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.150" end="00:03:49.100" style="s2">different response to the Gillette ad</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.860" end="00:03:50.600" style="s2">and I think part of that is because so</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.100" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">this girl can everything in there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.600" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">aspirational is this girl can do this</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.120" end="00:04:00.470" style="s2">very empowering nothing wrong with that</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.050" end="00:04:09.170" style="s2">and I mean it&#39;s very early to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:12.020" style="s2">saying whether the Gillette had a</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.170" end="00:04:13.940" style="s2">success or not but the the way that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.020" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">sort of raced to attend to one dislike</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.940" end="00:04:17.930" style="s2">ratio and then it&#39;s come back somewhat I</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:20.330" style="s2">don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s just cause a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.930" end="00:04:22.520" style="s2">lot of kind of early adopters and people</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.330" end="00:04:24.550" style="s2">who kind of immediately hate clicked on</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.520" end="00:04:27.950" style="s2">the ads were kind of anti the message</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.550" end="00:04:31.190" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of suggestions that</p>

<p begin="00:04:39.320" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">out on one of the ad agency campaign</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.960" end="00:04:46.970" style="s2">campaign a kind of official Bible of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:49.730" style="s2">ad agency there&#39;s already been a senior</p>

<p begin="00:04:49.730" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">successful campaign yeah I&#39;m pointing</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.980" end="00:04:57.890" style="s2">out Fernando de shoot who runs new macho</p>

<p begin="00:05:00.110" end="00:05:02.870" style="s2">target audience that&#39;s interesting what</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:04.250" style="s2">he was saying about I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.870" end="00:05:06.350" style="s2">really nuanced article he wrote I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.250" end="00:05:08.570" style="s2">actually surprised to see a major</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.350" end="00:05:10.490" style="s2">advertising publication put that out</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.570" end="00:05:13.820" style="s2">there so this is a guy he used to be the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.490" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">head of links links links and was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.820" end="00:05:18.530" style="s2">responsible for links rebranding</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:19.880" style="s2">from probably American viewers will be</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.530" end="00:05:22.930" style="s2">aware of it but links especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.880" end="00:05:25.550" style="s2">90s have really kind of crass</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.930" end="00:05:26.600" style="s2">advertising which was the idea was one</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.550" end="00:05:28.010" style="s2">of them was you spray yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.600" end="00:05:30.100" style="s2">links and a woman actually falls out of</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.010" end="00:05:32.360" style="s2">the sky like it like an angel you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.100" end="00:05:33.680" style="s2">they were kind of it was ridiculous and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.360" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">they had to they change their</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.680" end="00:05:37.520" style="s2">positioning to be a bit more mature and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:39.590" style="s2">he did a very good job of that so he was</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.520" end="00:05:41.240" style="s2">pointing out the fact amongst many other</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.590" end="00:05:45.020" style="s2">things about why the campaign isn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:48.110" style="s2">great is that it falls into the</p>

<p begin="00:05:48.110" end="00:05:52.730" style="s2">oversimplifies what we&#39;re men are really</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.260" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">at as well you know he&#39;s on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.730" end="00:05:57.380" style="s2">research with looking at talking to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:05:58.550" style="s2">2,000 men and women and I thought one of</p>

<p begin="00:05:58.550" end="00:06:02.380" style="s2">out is that it&#39;s not that there&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.740" end="00:06:06.140" style="s2">progressive man or traditionalist men</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.380" end="00:06:09.140" style="s2">most men have are holding different</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.140" end="00:06:11.390" style="s2">viewpoints at the same time so I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.140" end="00:06:15.350" style="s2">they focus on the symptoms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.390" end="00:06:18.050" style="s2">masculinity saying okay the main crisis</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.350" end="00:06:20.300" style="s2">has symptoms men are more violent men</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.050" end="00:06:24.950" style="s2">are not well behaved with women they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.300" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">not a man so they focus on that and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.950" end="00:06:29.390" style="s2">what was the underlying issues they</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.050" end="00:06:32.540" style="s2">focus on the symptoms if they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.390" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">focus on men are in crisis why they are</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.540" end="00:06:36.260" style="s2">in crisis that is what I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:38.600" style="s2">article they are in crisis because they</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.260" end="00:06:43.010" style="s2">are performing who they are unknown</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.600" end="00:06:46.720" style="s2">being there so it is empower them to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.010" end="00:06:52.010" style="s2">who they are they said okay why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.720" end="00:06:56.540" style="s2">teach them how to be and that was then</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.010" end="00:07:01.040" style="s2">the execution and mistake that is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.540" end="00:07:03.650" style="s2">idea of teach them how to be and do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.040" end="00:07:05.630" style="s2">also in in a way that is not very</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.650" end="00:07:07.100" style="s2">Olympic so I guess I&#39;m gonna frame this</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.630" end="00:07:09.050" style="s2">film that we&#39;re doing now it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.100" end="00:07:11.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a whole series called men and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.050" end="00:07:13.400" style="s2">women after me too based on the premise</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.240" end="00:07:14.360" style="s2">that if the cultural conversation right</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.400" end="00:07:16.910" style="s2">now looks like a dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.360" end="00:07:18.470" style="s2">relationship and I think it does what</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.910" end="00:07:21.380" style="s2">does a functional relationship look like</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.470" end="00:07:23.270" style="s2">and why I think Warren Farrell is such</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.380" end="00:07:26.420" style="s2">an interesting voice in this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.270" end="00:07:28.010" style="s2">that he was one of the earliest and most</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.420" end="00:07:31.070" style="s2">high-profile leaders of the feminist</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.010" end="00:07:33.670" style="s2">movement and then started doing men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.070" end="00:07:36.260" style="s2">groups listen to men&#39;s stories and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.670" end="00:07:39.650" style="s2">became known as the father of the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.260" end="00:07:41.900" style="s2">movement and but his real skill and his</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.650" end="00:07:43.460" style="s2">real job is relationship counseling like</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.900" end="00:07:45.710" style="s2">he runs relationship counseling with his</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.460" end="00:07:48.770" style="s2">wife he&#39;s a therapist it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.710" end="00:07:50.900" style="s2">cannot have a functional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.770" end="00:07:53.270" style="s2">between men and women if one side is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.900" end="00:07:55.070" style="s2">allowed to speak the more I paid</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.270" end="00:07:57.230" style="s2">attention to the dialogues that were</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.070" end="00:07:58.550" style="s2">happy to though the the discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.230" end="00:08:00.860" style="s2">were happening in the men&#39;s groups I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.550" end="00:08:03.890" style="s2">formed the forms of 300 men&#39;s groups and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.860" end="00:08:05.720" style="s2">those were ways where men opened up and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.890" end="00:08:09.290" style="s2">said what they felt in the safety of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.720" end="00:08:11.360" style="s2">other men who were saying gee I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.290" end="00:08:16.520" style="s2">realize anybody else but me felt that</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.360" end="00:08:19.760" style="s2">and so but then when many of them when I</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.520" end="00:08:21.920" style="s2">started to incorporate those what I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.760" end="00:08:24.140" style="s2">heard in the men&#39;s groups when I started</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.920" end="00:08:26.960" style="s2">to incorporate men&#39;s pain and feelings</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.140" end="00:08:29.330" style="s2">into my presentations of two groups at</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.960" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">colleges and universities I found myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.330" end="00:08:34.540" style="s2">going from very large standing ovations</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">large audiences standing ovations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.540" end="00:08:39.230" style="s2">always being invited back to two or</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:42.890" style="s2">three more speaking engagements versus</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.230" end="00:08:44.720" style="s2">slowly all of that dwindled and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.890" end="00:08:46.730" style="s2">that if I continued speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.720" end="00:08:49.700" style="s2">incorporating men&#39;s feelings and fears</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.730" end="00:08:51.860" style="s2">that I would continue to have fewer and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.700" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">fewer speaking engagements and I had to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.860" end="00:08:56.690" style="s2">make a decision you know did I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:59.660" style="s2">have you know now that I saw the formula</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.690" end="00:09:02.420" style="s2">did I want to be formula speak and have</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.660" end="00:09:05.240" style="s2">a huge income and do very well and be</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.420" end="00:09:07.940" style="s2">very respected and and and applauded or</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.240" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">did I want to go ahead and and try to</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.940" end="00:09:12.620" style="s2">discover my best truth and speak up</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:14.810" style="s2">about that and try to represent and</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.620" end="00:09:17.810" style="s2">incorporate men and it while still</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.810" end="00:09:20.450" style="s2">retaining a compassion for women and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.810" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">and make that part of my life and my my</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.450" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">contribution and I decided at least I</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:28.070" style="s2">would try to incorporate the best truth</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:30.530" style="s2">that I could why I think this is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.070" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">key right now is we&#39;re in a cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.530" end="00:09:35.570" style="s2">context immediately after me to those it</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:35.900" style="s2">was actually said men now is not your</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.570" end="00:09:37.690" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.900" end="00:09:40.070" style="s2">speak now is your time to listen</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.690" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">absolutely I can understand that I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.070" end="00:09:46.730" style="s2">we&#39;ve said before like me too was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:49.670" style="s2">valuable before it went too far was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.730" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">valuable speaking up of women who</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.670" end="00:09:53.420" style="s2">perhaps had never felt able to have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:54.550" style="s2">voice have never been able to express</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.420" end="00:09:57.170" style="s2">some of the things they express</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.550" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">fantastic and perhaps it was appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.170" end="00:10:01.520" style="s2">then for men to listen and women to</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:03.830" style="s2">speak but you can&#39;t stay there because</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.520" end="00:10:05.570" style="s2">by definition that is not a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.830" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not a relationship it can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.570" end="00:10:10.490" style="s2">relationship it&#39;s so where when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:14.690" style="s2">both allowed to speak what would we be</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.490" end="00:10:16.880" style="s2">saying and we&#39;ve also got a very quite a</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.690" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">lot of lived experience lived experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:22.670" style="s2">for want of another problematic term</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:26.080" style="s2">because we leave men&#39;s groups and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.670" end="00:10:30.170" style="s2">we see so we see men coming to our</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.080" end="00:10:32.630" style="s2">groups with a whole range of different</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.170" end="00:10:34.820" style="s2">issues but one of the big things that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.630" end="00:10:36.500" style="s2">see almost all the time is men with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.820" end="00:10:38.630" style="s2">real sense of shame around themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.500" end="00:10:40.630" style="s2">men and I think that&#39;s such a big thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.630" end="00:10:44.840" style="s2">in the cultural context right now and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.630" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not recognized it&#39;s not spoken to</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.840" end="00:10:49.640" style="s2">it&#39;s still like where we&#39;re operating in</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:52.970" style="s2">the 1950s almost where the big problem</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.640" end="00:10:54.680" style="s2">is just toxic masculinity and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.970" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">really unbalanced picture and I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.680" end="00:10:59.660" style="s2">that&#39;s why this is such a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:11:01.900" style="s2">thing to unpick because if you went</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.660" end="00:11:05.150" style="s2">through the film frame by frame you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.900" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">probably agree with most of the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.150" end="00:11:08.840" style="s2">within it like yes I think I think as</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:11.540" style="s2">men we should kind of hold each other</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.840" end="00:11:12.920" style="s2">accountable I think we should aspire to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.540" end="00:11:16.280" style="s2">be the best that we can be I think we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.920" end="00:11:19.460" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t objectify women I think we</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.280" end="00:11:21.560" style="s2">should stand up for the underdog I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.460" end="00:11:23.210" style="s2">all of these things are valuable but</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.560" end="00:11:25.310" style="s2">what is the cultural context that this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.210" end="00:11:28.100" style="s2">is being put into yeah and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.310" end="00:11:30.110" style="s2">other thing just if I think back to what</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.100" end="00:11:32.630" style="s2">we experienced leading the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.110" end="00:11:35.540" style="s2">workshops is that a lot of what we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.630" end="00:11:36.890" style="s2">lot of what we are experiencing together</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.540" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">is getting into a space where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.890" end="00:11:40.820" style="s2">often Takai ourselves and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:42.830" style="s2">efforting we&#39;re not coming from a space</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.820" end="00:11:44.660" style="s2">of feeling inadequate having to prove</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.830" end="00:11:46.110" style="s2">ourselves by getting validation from the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.660" end="00:11:48.570" style="s2">outside world I&#39;ll be the big</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.110" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">tough-guy whatever it is we call we talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.570" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">about relaxed confidence so it&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">of being connected to myself being</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:57.720" style="s2">authentically me and from that space I</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:12:00.660" style="s2">don&#39;t need to act out in these ways now</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.720" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">that comes from connecting to oneself</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.660" end="00:12:04.380" style="s2">that&#39;s an inner journey but we may do</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:06.329" style="s2">with others and with the support of</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.380" end="00:12:10.140" style="s2">others but ultimately that comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.329" end="00:12:12.300" style="s2">place within and one thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.140" end="00:12:15.209" style="s2">difficult about the ad is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.300" end="00:12:17.670" style="s2">effectively telling people how to behave</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.209" end="00:12:18.600" style="s2">you know and I think the the refrain and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.670" end="00:12:19.950" style="s2">the thing they have in the description</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.600" end="00:12:23.399" style="s2">is say the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.950" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2">act the right way and that for me and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.399" end="00:12:26.279" style="s2">totally agree with you now looking at</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:27.660" style="s2">individual points in the film it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.279" end="00:12:28.680" style="s2">yes well I mean that&#39;s being a decent</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.680" end="00:12:32.820" style="s2">disagree with a lot of that in the wider</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.420" end="00:12:36.029" style="s2">context and the bizarre situation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.820" end="00:12:37.589" style="s2">Gillett a razor company telling men to</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.029" end="00:12:41.070" style="s2">say the right thing act the right way</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.589" end="00:12:43.260" style="s2">hey who are they to say it and be what</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.070" end="00:12:46.649" style="s2">axioms are they basing that behavior on</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.260" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s usually that&#39;s the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.649" end="00:12:51.630" style="s2">religion or philosophy to to decide what</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:53.970" style="s2">are the right ways to behave how do we</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.630" end="00:12:56.640" style="s2">you know it&#39;s very bizarre and it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.970" end="00:12:58.529" style="s2">open question I&#39;m very curious what is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.640" end="00:13:00.089" style="s2">the right way to behave and the right</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.529" end="00:13:02.640" style="s2">way to think and behave and you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.089" end="00:13:05.250" style="s2">according to to the left just and just</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.640" end="00:13:06.870" style="s2">to preface a potential counter-argument</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.250" end="00:13:09.630" style="s2">which I&#39;ve seen to this point which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.870" end="00:13:11.550" style="s2">that brands because they have so many</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.630" end="00:13:12.810" style="s2">they have such a big audience that they</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.550" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">have a moral worth but they do have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.810" end="00:13:18.120" style="s2">moral responsibility to tackle issues</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:19.380" style="s2">and look at social issues okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.120" end="00:13:21.240" style="s2">assume that&#39;s true and I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.380" end="00:13:23.190" style="s2">something in that brands do have a huge</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.240" end="00:13:25.949" style="s2">audience and you know brand having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.190" end="00:13:29.610" style="s2">social role is not necessarily a problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.949" end="00:13:32.430" style="s2">in and of itself but the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.610" end="00:13:34.380" style="s2">role and the way it&#39;s executed can be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.430" end="00:13:35.910" style="s2">massive massive problem and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.380" end="00:13:39.029" style="s2">love ways I think a lot of the pushback</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.910" end="00:13:41.600" style="s2">with Gillette has been this is far too</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.029" end="00:13:45.360" style="s2">much and the toning which is slivered is</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.600" end="00:13:47.339" style="s2">condescending it&#39;s patronizing and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.360" end="00:13:48.769" style="s2">big issue goes back to that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.339" end="00:13:51.269" style="s2">think the right way act the right way</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.769" end="00:13:52.769" style="s2">it&#39;s not really okay for anyone to say</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.269" end="00:13:54.540" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s no sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.769" end="00:13:56.550" style="s2">inquiry into okay what is it like for</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.540" end="00:13:57.840" style="s2">men what&#39;s going on let&#39;s have a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.550" end="00:14:00.540" style="s2">open discussion it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.840" end="00:14:02.640" style="s2">didactic so yeah I think the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.540" end="00:14:06.270" style="s2">context is the really important piece</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.640" end="00:14:09.410" style="s2">recently there was an article in The</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.270" end="00:14:12.210" style="s2">Washington Post why can&#39;t we hate men</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.410" end="00:14:15.210" style="s2">now you could say that&#39;s an outlier but</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.210" end="00:14:18.510" style="s2">for that to be commissioned by a</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.210" end="00:14:20.820" style="s2">mainstream publication when no one could</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.510" end="00:14:23.779" style="s2">even imagine commissioning something why</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.820" end="00:14:27.420" style="s2">can&#39;t we hate women it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.779" end="00:14:30.870" style="s2">it&#39;s this idea of do men men do not have</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.420" end="00:14:32.670" style="s2">to fall for women to rise and the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.870" end="00:14:34.020" style="s2">point very recently even at about two or</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.670" end="00:14:37.940" style="s2">three days ago there were the APA</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.020" end="00:14:41.660" style="s2">guidelines which were clearly</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.940" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2">ideologically driven and were</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.660" end="00:14:46.950" style="s2">criticizing aspects of traditional</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.740" end="00:14:49.650" style="s2">masculinity which included they</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.950" end="00:14:51.779" style="s2">described a stoicism ambition for the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.650" end="00:14:52.980" style="s2">sake of it in the end they were forced</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.779" end="00:14:54.600" style="s2">to issue a clarification and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.980" end="00:14:58.830" style="s2">clarification ended up pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.600" end="00:15:01.020" style="s2">saying well men who pursue their own</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.830" end="00:15:03.780" style="s2">goals at the expense of everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.020" end="00:15:05.339" style="s2">are dangerous and bad and in the end</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.780" end="00:15:07.410" style="s2">they ended up describing a psychopath</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.339" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">like Psychopaths are bad it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.410" end="00:15:11.130" style="s2">okay so why did you call it traditional</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:12.630" style="s2">masculinity I think Warren Farrell makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.130" end="00:15:14.730" style="s2">a really interesting point as well about</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.630" end="00:15:16.800" style="s2">how the cultural conversation is going</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.730" end="00:15:18.300" style="s2">right now where let me see in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.800" end="00:15:21.180" style="s2">workshops men are really quite confused</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.300" end="00:15:22.110" style="s2">and and kind of scared about it feels</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.180" end="00:15:23.100" style="s2">like a lot of people feel like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.110" end="00:15:24.600" style="s2">walking on eggshells</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.100" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">I think part of that is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.600" end="00:15:29.610" style="s2">a huge social pressure to be more</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:31.410" style="s2">vulnerable speak more but then at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.610" end="00:15:33.060" style="s2">same time Warren Farrell points us out</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.410" end="00:15:35.100" style="s2">there&#39;s an equal pressure to shut the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.060" end="00:15:36.630" style="s2">hell up and listen on one level we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.100" end="00:15:37.890" style="s2">a narrative that says men need to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.630" end="00:15:40.680" style="s2">much more in touch with their emotional</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.890" end="00:15:42.300" style="s2">side they need to be much more men lock</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.680" end="00:15:45.780" style="s2">things down and that&#39;s really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.300" end="00:15:48.720" style="s2">women often complaining about that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.780" end="00:15:49.800" style="s2">then on the other side when men do say</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.720" end="00:15:51.780" style="s2">how they&#39;re feeling they&#39;re often</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.800" end="00:15:53.760" style="s2">described as whining or complaining and</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.780" end="00:15:55.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a little compassion for it this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.760" end="00:15:57.570" style="s2">is exactly accurate and this is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.890" end="00:16:00.900" style="s2">this is one of the challenges that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.570" end="00:16:04.230" style="s2">need to really confront is that that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.900" end="00:16:07.709" style="s2">say men speak up share your feelings</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.230" end="00:16:10.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like Lois Lane and Superman Lois</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.709" end="00:16:12.970" style="s2">Lane wanted and begged Superman to cry</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.450" end="00:16:16.540" style="s2">but she has zero interest in hearing</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.970" end="00:16:18.790" style="s2">about anything from Clark Kent women do</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.540" end="00:16:21.339" style="s2">want to hear men&#39;s feelings and hurts</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.790" end="00:16:22.450" style="s2">and pains if they&#39;re assured first that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.339" end="00:16:25.029" style="s2">their Superman that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.450" end="00:16:27.130" style="s2">protector but when they meet Clark Kent</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.029" end="00:16:30.850" style="s2">and he&#39;s more open about his feelings</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.130" end="00:16:32.860" style="s2">and his pain this just turns the women</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.850" end="00:16:35.829" style="s2">off and women don&#39;t understand this</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.860" end="00:16:37.959" style="s2">about themselves they think that oh you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.829" end="00:16:41.139" style="s2">know my husband really cried when his</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.959" end="00:16:43.810" style="s2">old when his mother was dying of cancer</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.139" end="00:16:45.639" style="s2">I really supported that so doesn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.810" end="00:16:48.699" style="s2">mean I support a man expressing his</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.639" end="00:16:50.500" style="s2">feelings the answer is yes and no you</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.699" end="00:16:52.779" style="s2">ears you&#39;re supportive of a man</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.500" end="00:16:54.940" style="s2">expressing his feelings what he&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.779" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">he has empathy for someone else&#39;s pain</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.940" end="00:16:59.740" style="s2">you&#39;re not often support or look more</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:02.769" style="s2">introspectively about whether you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.740" end="00:17:05.770" style="s2">open to a man expressing his feelings of</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.769" end="00:17:08.740" style="s2">anger or hurt or upset about something</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.770" end="00:17:11.380" style="s2">that you did but when you experience it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.740" end="00:17:14.140" style="s2">as a criticism from your husband from</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.380" end="00:17:16.600" style="s2">your boyfriend oftentimes your boyfriend</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.140" end="00:17:18.819" style="s2">experiences you as backing off as being</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.600" end="00:17:21.160" style="s2">less willing to be sexual less willing</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.819" end="00:17:23.799" style="s2">to be emotionally open being more</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.160" end="00:17:25.510" style="s2">distant from him after that he needs</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.799" end="00:17:27.429" style="s2">your love he wants your love when he</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.510" end="00:17:30.070" style="s2">expresses what hurts him and gives him</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.429" end="00:17:31.900" style="s2">pain and he sees that you back off he</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.070" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">tends to repress it because everybody</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.900" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">else as well as you in the society has</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:38.919" style="s2">encouraged him to back off from</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:41.230" style="s2">expressing his weakness in any culture</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.919" end="00:17:44.110" style="s2">there will be some misogyny but there</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.230" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">will also be misandry because of I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.110" end="00:17:47.830" style="s2">misogyny comes wrong you have a negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:48.790" style="s2">experiences as women you have a bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.830" end="00:17:50.470" style="s2">relationship with your mother or</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.790" end="00:17:52.720" style="s2">whatever and that can get internalized</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.470" end="00:17:57.250" style="s2">and some we see if that&#39;s that that acts</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.720" end="00:17:59.140" style="s2">out and I think but the art the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.250" end="00:18:01.210" style="s2">misandry where women have bad</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.140" end="00:18:03.100" style="s2">experiences with men bad upbringing was</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.210" end="00:18:05.080" style="s2">bad romantic experiencing and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.100" end="00:18:05.740" style="s2">internalized a generalized resentment</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.080" end="00:18:07.720" style="s2">towards men</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.740" end="00:18:10.049" style="s2">there is it&#39;s not most people don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.720" end="00:18:13.809" style="s2">know what the word misandry means and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.049" end="00:18:17.740" style="s2">what&#39;s really I don&#39;t think enough</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.809" end="00:18:19.750" style="s2">people recognize water the the culture</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.740" end="00:18:21.640" style="s2">that we&#39;re in for example we did an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.750" end="00:18:22.700" style="s2">interview with Cassie J who did the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.640" end="00:18:24.080" style="s2">red</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.700" end="00:18:25.550" style="s2">so it&#39;s a film about the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.080" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">movement she went into that film</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.550" end="00:18:31.040" style="s2">genuinely as a feminist who was going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:34.070" style="s2">do an expose on the men&#39;s rights</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.040" end="00:18:35.480" style="s2">movement and she had her mind changed</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.070" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">during this film we&#39;ve interviewed her</p>

<p begin="00:18:41.540" end="00:18:45.710" style="s2">there were issues around men&#39;s rights</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.870" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">make any kind of money in whatsoever and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.140" end="00:19:02.870" style="s2">was very brave</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.430" end="00:19:11.000" style="s2">was given a mauling on most of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.380" end="00:19:13.700" style="s2">of mainstream TV channels that she went</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.000" end="00:19:16.730" style="s2">on to this happened we recently put out</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.700" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">a piece also by Heather huiying who the</p>

<p begin="00:19:32.990" end="00:19:37.370" style="s2">think the whole framing around is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.520" end="00:19:39.650" style="s2">dodgy but let&#39;s let&#39;s at least bring in</p>

<p begin="00:19:39.650" end="00:19:44.690" style="s2">think is the cultural context of why</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.350" end="00:19:47.210" style="s2">people are reacting to this it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.690" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">it&#39;s part of a non perhaps overreacting</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.210" end="00:19:53.540" style="s2">to it as well because it&#39;s part of an</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:56.440" style="s2">ongoing narrative that has come from the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.540" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">university&#39;s postmodern relativism and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.440" end="00:20:01.640" style="s2">has been increasingly pushing out into</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:03.350" style="s2">the culture at large and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.640" end="00:20:05.000" style="s2">the key thing in terms of the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.350" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">context to understand I&#39;ve seen a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.000" end="00:20:10.100" style="s2">people asking and I think with genuine</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:12.020" style="s2">confusion why is anyone upset about this</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.100" end="00:20:14.540" style="s2">ad you know how did anyone have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.020" end="00:20:15.830" style="s2">problem with men acting this way and as</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.540" end="00:20:17.930" style="s2">we said before it&#39;s not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.830" end="00:20:19.700" style="s2">behaviors that are going on it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.930" end="00:20:22.160" style="s2">within the framework of what you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.700" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">mentioned of let&#39;s just lay out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.160" end="00:20:26.300" style="s2">system basically of what this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">the kind of postmodern worldview is and</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.300" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">why it matters to this conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.940" end="00:20:34.750" style="s2">it breaks the world down into identity</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">groups and then also breaks it that work</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.750" end="00:20:39.250" style="s2">reduces everything to power relations so</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:42.100" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing going on within that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.250" end="00:20:45.370" style="s2">framework men especially with the kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.100" end="00:20:47.350" style="s2">of the way third grade feminism is going</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.370" end="00:20:50.380" style="s2">right now maybe not where it came from</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.350" end="00:20:52.450" style="s2">but the way it goes in some circles men</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.380" end="00:20:55.690" style="s2">are at the top of that hierarchy by</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.450" end="00:20:58.059" style="s2">definition it doesn&#39;t matter what Batman</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.690" end="00:21:01.059" style="s2">you know what his situation is by by</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.059" end="00:21:03.220" style="s2">virtue of his group identity he&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.059" end="00:21:05.590" style="s2">top of that power hierarchy so in this</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.220" end="00:21:08.770" style="s2">extreme form he&#39;s the cause of all the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.590" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">world&#39;s ills is inherently in a position</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.770" end="00:21:14.049" style="s2">of power and privilege and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.029" style="s2">needs to be in some sense and has been</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.049" end="00:21:18.130" style="s2">throughout history yes as well yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.029" end="00:21:21.940" style="s2">exactly and and from that what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.130" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">noticed is a sense of men are inherently</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.940" end="00:21:25.809" style="s2">dangerous and they need to be taught how</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">to behave and they need to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.809" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked before about this idea of</p>

<p begin="00:21:32.679" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">does happen little boys in school being</p>

<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">forced into behaving in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.820" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">more conducive and less masculine all of</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.289" style="s2">that is going on and it comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:49.390" style="s2">sense of it comes from a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.289" end="00:21:51.250" style="s2">worldview and yes and it&#39;s rampant in</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.390" end="00:21:54.010" style="s2">critical theory and universities in</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.010" end="00:21:56.890" style="s2">I think a lot of people have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:21:58.630" style="s2">more nuanced take on this particular</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.890" end="00:22:01.029" style="s2">kind of ideology but on it&#39;s mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.630" end="00:22:03.130" style="s2">its most extreme form it obliterates any</p>

<p begin="00:22:20.620" end="00:22:23.860" style="s2">obliterates the fact that throughout</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.270" end="00:22:27.070" style="s2">most of history men were</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.200" end="00:22:36.309" style="s2">for others and this is completely missed</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.779" end="00:22:37.690" style="s2">in this kind of idea that men were just</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.960" end="00:22:48.090" style="s2">is now manifesting</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.000" end="00:23:04.260" style="s2">up in an in a dysfunctional relationship</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.620" end="00:23:06.450" style="s2">that would be kind men we know we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.700" end="00:23:13.080" style="s2">we&#39;re repressed we&#39;re so repressed that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.040" end="00:23:16.770" style="s2">we&#39;re the sexes that commit suicide and</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.920" end="00:23:27.510" style="s2">greater amount than women and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.560" end="00:23:31.110" style="s2">not dysfunctional and tell me what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.510" end="00:23:33.750" style="s2">now suicide is probably the ultimate so</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.110" end="00:23:35.790" style="s2">in order for us so we are wanting men to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.750" end="00:23:38.850" style="s2">open up on the one hand and then we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:53.400" style="s2">getting told that they&#39;re filled with</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.130" end="00:23:56.090" style="s2">power and privilege and yet walking</p>

<p begin="00:24:04.920" end="00:24:08.190" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s that is about as dysfunctional</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.850" end="00:27:04.710" style="s2">the 1960s really I mean that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.910" end="00:27:06.510" style="s2">completely ludicrous perspective to be</p>

<p begin="00:27:16.840" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">in that game so you have to no matter</p>

<p begin="00:27:27.010" end="00:27:32.470" style="s2">to that particular religion let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.140" end="00:27:35.020" style="s2">it you must still maintain that you are</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.470" end="00:27:36.430" style="s2">the victim and that and then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.020" end="00:27:37.840" style="s2">find other victims as well they it gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.430" end="00:27:40.420" style="s2">kind of a you know people called it race</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.840" end="00:27:42.250" style="s2">to the bottle if we grant that women</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.420" end="00:27:44.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a voice in public until the</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.250" end="00:27:49.180" style="s2">1960s which i&#39;m which i think is is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.620" end="00:27:50.830" style="s2">pretty true and where we&#39;re hearing</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.180" end="00:27:53.340" style="s2">women&#39;s voices women&#39;s stories for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.830" end="00:27:57.280" style="s2">first time for the last 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.340" end="00:28:00.670" style="s2">have we really heard men&#39;s emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.280" end="00:28:02.740" style="s2">truths at all because it was never part</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.670" end="00:28:05.440" style="s2">of traditional masculinity that men</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.740" end="00:28:06.970" style="s2">would be emotionally vulnerable so ok</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.440" end="00:28:09.100" style="s2">we&#39;ve we&#39;ve only listened to women for</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.970" end="00:28:11.980" style="s2">about 50 years but how long have we been</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.100" end="00:28:14.050" style="s2">listening to men&#39;s deeper truths about</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.980" end="00:28:16.930" style="s2">their experience we have to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.050" end="00:28:19.570" style="s2">the male-female evolutionary dance has</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.930" end="00:28:22.870" style="s2">evolved as a tango for millions of years</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.570" end="00:28:24.220" style="s2">and it&#39;s very important that women speak</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.870" end="00:28:26.290" style="s2">up about what they do and don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.220" end="00:28:28.030" style="s2">about their parts of the tango and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.290" end="00:28:29.080" style="s2">we recognize that there are thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.030" end="00:28:30.550" style="s2">different women from different</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.080" end="00:28:32.380" style="s2">backgrounds who have different answers</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.550" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">to that question that women don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.380" end="00:28:36.490" style="s2">have one message to deliver on that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:37.960" style="s2">issue at the same time all the exact</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.490" end="00:28:40.810" style="s2">opposite is also true</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.960" end="00:28:42.010" style="s2">it is not true that we haven&#39;t listened</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.810" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">to women</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.010" end="00:28:45.970" style="s2">we haven&#39;t listened to women speak the</p>

<p begin="00:28:45.970" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">half-century but we haven&#39;t listened to</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.160" end="00:28:52.540" style="s2">men express their feelings ever at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:55.390" style="s2">that was exactly the opposite of what</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.540" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">masculinity was about so let&#39;s open up</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.390" end="00:29:00.790" style="s2">and hear boys and men&#39;s stories but what</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:04.390" style="s2">do we need to do we need to know how to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.790" end="00:29:06.070" style="s2">listen so on the subject of men&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.390" end="00:29:07.690" style="s2">of emotional stories not being heard</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.070" end="00:29:09.730" style="s2">it&#39;s also quite closely linked to that</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.690" end="00:29:12.250" style="s2">idea of men being forced to play certain</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.730" end="00:29:14.080" style="s2">roles or you know for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.250" end="00:29:16.150" style="s2">playing certain roles I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.080" end="00:29:17.860" style="s2">best criticisms of the Jillette ad is</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.150" end="00:29:19.450" style="s2">actually from Fernando the</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.860" end="00:29:22.360" style="s2">advertising guy we talked about earlier</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.450" end="00:29:24.850" style="s2">where he points out that they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.360" end="00:29:27.490" style="s2">effectively doing exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.850" end="00:29:29.380" style="s2">in that ad they are saying you must</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:30.220" style="s2">perform a certain role to be the right</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.380" end="00:29:31.900" style="s2">kind of man</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.220" end="00:29:34.270" style="s2">so Gillette is really doing what</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.900" end="00:29:36.010" style="s2">Gillette was doing in the 1950s this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.270" end="00:29:38.440" style="s2">how to be the right kind of man and</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.010" end="00:29:42.340" style="s2">they&#39;re doing exactly the same thing so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.440" end="00:29:45.340" style="s2">they are effectively just I&#39;d say moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.340" end="00:29:47.070" style="s2">the goal posts repackaging it and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.340" end="00:29:49.600" style="s2">core problem remains the same of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.070" end="00:29:52.510" style="s2">pressuring and shaming people into</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.600" end="00:29:55.960" style="s2">behaving in a certain way and hidden</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.510" end="00:29:59.410" style="s2">within that is the idea that unless you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.960" end="00:30:01.990" style="s2">are threatened or compelled to act in</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.410" end="00:30:04.180" style="s2">that way you won&#39;t act that way that men</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.990" end="00:30:06.310" style="s2">by their nature are not good</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.180" end="00:30:09.430" style="s2">that there is something inherently toxic</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.310" end="00:30:11.740" style="s2">about masculinity about men and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.430" end="00:30:14.530" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s terrifying is that unless</p>

<p begin="00:30:14.530" end="00:30:19.540" style="s2">yourself in and behave you will act out</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.020" end="00:30:21.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s really that&#39;s toxic</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.540" end="00:30:23.110" style="s2">yeah and it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.280" end="00:30:26.440" style="s2">I just think of as soon as you say that</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.110" end="00:30:30.250" style="s2">I think of the many beautiful moments of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.440" end="00:30:33.460" style="s2">male support and brotherhood we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.250" end="00:30:35.380" style="s2">the workshops I would quite like anyone</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.460" end="00:30:37.150" style="s2">who wants to mature let marketing team</p>

<p begin="00:30:37.150" end="00:30:41.500" style="s2">witness it just to see how absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.250" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">off the mark that is and how absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.500" end="00:30:44.740" style="s2">damaging and toxic it is to put that</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:47.110" style="s2">message out there they make a big show</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.740" end="00:30:48.370" style="s2">about the boys of the future you know</p>
