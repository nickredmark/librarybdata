<p begin="00:03:31.060" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">is what should be one of our major areas</p>

<p begin="00:03:40.750" end="00:03:47.680" style="s2">diagnoses are rightly talked about</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:49.630" style="s2">imposing a tax which perhaps the global</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.680" end="00:03:53.050" style="s2">community should look at very seriously</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.630" end="00:03:58.180" style="s2">for the use of global Commons because</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.050" end="00:04:00.900" style="s2">it&#39;s everybody&#39;s what should I say</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.180" end="00:04:04.300" style="s2">inheritance and yet it seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.900" end="00:04:07.200" style="s2">nobody&#39;s possession so we funded it the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.300" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">over use it to the extent that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.200" end="00:04:13.890" style="s2">we have now reached the point where we</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:16.989" style="s2">need to work much faster and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.890" end="00:04:20.530" style="s2">explain much larger resources to solve</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.989" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">the problem then if we are done so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.530" end="00:04:29.920" style="s2">20 or 25 years ago so we need to not</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">only use knowledge but also shed the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.920" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">illusion of knowledge what we think</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:38.410" style="s2">you&#39;re funny and here I&#39;d like to put</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:40.540" style="s2">something that job and a change said he</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.410" end="00:04:43.690" style="s2">said the difficulty lies not in the new</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.540" end="00:04:47.740" style="s2">ideas but an escaping from the old ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.690" end="00:04:50.560" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s it was a challenge is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.740" end="00:04:53.080" style="s2">finding the means by which we can bridge</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.560" end="00:04:57.820" style="s2">the gap between knowledge and its</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.080" end="00:05:01.930" style="s2">application i personally believe that</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.820" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">there is really not an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.930" end="00:05:08.139" style="s2">this is provided to the whole issue of</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:12.100" style="s2">risk management after all human society</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.139" end="00:05:14.850" style="s2">is missing risks the spread of poverty</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.100" end="00:05:19.300" style="s2">is one type of residence but we are</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.850" end="00:05:21.850" style="s2">exacerbating that condition by imposing</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.300" end="00:05:24.190" style="s2">let&#39;s say need paxil climate change</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.850" end="00:05:27.970" style="s2">there are going to make it almost</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.190" end="00:05:30.520" style="s2">impossible for poor people to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.970" end="00:05:33.610" style="s2">lift themselves out of the tension that</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:36.070" style="s2">they arranged so I think we really need</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.610" end="00:05:38.530" style="s2">to pay attention through the whole</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.070" end="00:05:41.349" style="s2">objective of risk management in</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.530" end="00:05:44.410" style="s2">development policy as in this context I</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.349" end="00:05:48.520" style="s2">would like to say that the IPCC has</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.410" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">brought out two special reports in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.520" end="00:05:54.400" style="s2">last year which have particular</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:56.349" style="s2">relevance to what I&#39;m talking about one</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.400" end="00:05:59.050" style="s2">of them deals with extreme events in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.349" end="00:06:01.419" style="s2">disaster and the other deals with</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.050" end="00:06:04.150" style="s2">renewable energy sources and climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.419" end="00:06:06.190" style="s2">change mitigation so on the one hand we</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.150" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">are talking about these types of climate</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.190" end="00:06:12.039" style="s2">changes which represented a major threat</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:15.340" style="s2">for human society and all living species</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.039" end="00:06:18.400" style="s2">and on the other we are looking at means</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.340" end="00:06:20.440" style="s2">mention was made earlier about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.400" end="00:06:23.349" style="s2">about the transition away from fossil</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.440" end="00:06:26.860" style="s2">fuels well as it happens renewable</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.349" end="00:06:28.510" style="s2">energy technologies today of one part of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.860" end="00:06:32.650" style="s2">the solution that should be implemented</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.510" end="00:06:36.430" style="s2">with the sense of urgency but if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.650" end="00:06:38.740" style="s2">look at it minimizing risks then they</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.430" end="00:06:41.289" style="s2">really talking about the use of</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.740" end="00:06:43.720" style="s2">incremental steps versus</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.289" end="00:06:46.659" style="s2">transformational changes and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.720" end="00:06:49.599" style="s2">question he should ask is in specific</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.659" end="00:06:52.780" style="s2">conditions are small incremental steps</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.599" end="00:06:56.710" style="s2">and often or do we need to bring about</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.780" end="00:07:00.310" style="s2">changes because it is entirely possible</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.710" end="00:07:03.760" style="s2">that with extreme climate and weather</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.310" end="00:07:06.820" style="s2">events we may find it very difficult for</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.760" end="00:07:10.210" style="s2">systems to adapt sustainably without</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.820" end="00:07:12.220" style="s2">transformational change so I think this</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.210" end="00:07:14.889" style="s2">is an issue that we have to build into</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.220" end="00:07:17.110" style="s2">our development policies and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.889" end="00:07:19.960" style="s2">we must also create the conditions by</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.110" end="00:07:21.669" style="s2">which societies are resilient because</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.960" end="00:07:24.460" style="s2">there will be risks there will be the</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.669" end="00:07:26.770" style="s2">last and a fall through mitigation of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.460" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">conditions of me now scat systems we</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.770" end="00:07:31.270" style="s2">have to contain them we have been limit</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" end="00:07:34.600" style="s2">them it but we really don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.270" end="00:07:37.830" style="s2">choice other than to adapt to some</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.600" end="00:07:40.630" style="s2">impacts that are our inevitable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.830" end="00:07:43.780" style="s2">societies which happened within this</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.630" end="00:07:47.200" style="s2">extremely important notion of resilience</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.780" end="00:07:49.210" style="s2">in our development policies the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.200" end="00:07:52.930" style="s2">degradation of English systems are also</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.210" end="00:07:56.560" style="s2">of course often something else these</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.930" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">provide essential services and if these</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.560" end="00:08:00.430" style="s2">services are affected than we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:03.610" style="s2">limiting the options for future risk</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.430" end="00:08:05.950" style="s2">management and of course in all this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.610" end="00:08:09.430" style="s2">learning processes are extremely crucial</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.950" end="00:08:11.470" style="s2">because unless we use knowledge we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.430" end="00:08:14.620" style="s2">be doing things which are ineffective or</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.470" end="00:08:18.100" style="s2">much too expensive so what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.620" end="00:08:20.590" style="s2">that we need and interactive set of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.100" end="00:08:23.650" style="s2">policies that involve a tactician</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.590" end="00:08:25.330" style="s2">mitigation as well as sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.650" end="00:08:28.530" style="s2">development and the three are linked</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.330" end="00:08:31.510" style="s2">together you can&#39;t have one without the</p>

<p begin="00:10:27.100" end="00:10:32.700" style="s2">is that all of this has happened only if</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.490" end="00:10:35.110" style="s2">we adopt the lights and policies and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.700" end="00:10:37.810" style="s2">policies necessarily will have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.110" end="00:10:41.560" style="s2">forward-looking will have to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.810" end="00:10:45.160" style="s2">comprehensive and broad in their suite</p>

<p begin="00:10:47.950" end="00:10:55.540" style="s2">say in this special performance we</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">assess 164 definition values of our</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.540" end="00:11:01.329" style="s2">renewable energy can take the share of</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:04.110" style="s2">energy supply by 2050 and you would be</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.329" end="00:11:07.570" style="s2">surprised that the range is very must</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.110" end="00:11:11.199" style="s2">from a level percent of the total energy</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.570" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">supply in 2050 from radio and resources</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.199" end="00:11:17.290" style="s2">to seventy-seven percent now why is</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:19.870" style="s2">there this huge space well simply</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.290" end="00:11:22.269" style="s2">because this is going to be dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.870" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">the policies that we adopt not in 20</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.269" end="00:11:25.980" style="s2">fucking but that we</p>
