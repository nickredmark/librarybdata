<p begin="00:00:04.940" end="00:00:10.380" style="s2">so my name is Michael Robillard and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.160" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">a philosopher at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.380" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">Oxford and I focused mainly on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:20.070" style="s2">ethics of war so in a past life prior to</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">my my time is a professional philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.070" end="00:00:24.300" style="s2">I was an officer in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:27.000" style="s2">military I was an officer with the 82nd</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.300" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">airborne for five years roughly I spent</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.000" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">eight months in Iraq in 2003 2004 as a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:36.540" style="s2">light infantry platoon leader and I</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">exited the military in 2007 and have</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.540" end="00:00:44.489" style="s2">been doing philosophy in some capacity</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:45.870" style="s2">ever since so at least for the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.489" end="00:00:48.530" style="s2">years since I&#39;ve been out and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.870" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">reintegrate back into civilian society</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.530" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">you know I&#39;ve talked with a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:56.430" style="s2">veteran friends from Iraq or Afghanistan</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">trying to sort of make sense of what it</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.430" end="00:01:02.879" style="s2">is that we took part in and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:06.869" style="s2">to sort of fit back in and move past it</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.879" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">and I came across a book called tribe by</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.869" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">the war journalist Sebastian Junger</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">and what Younger looked at was that</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:18.810" style="s2">there&#39;s since war - there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:21.509" style="s2">decline in in trigger time and a combat</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.810" end="00:01:24.090" style="s2">time for soldiers from World War two</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.509" end="00:01:27.000" style="s2">through Korea through Vietnam through</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.090" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">the existing engagements in Iraq and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.000" end="00:01:32.729" style="s2">Afghanistan and there&#39;s been an inverse</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:35.820" style="s2">relationship of reports of PTSD and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.729" end="00:01:38.159" style="s2">psychological illness in reported in</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.820" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">soldiers so that seems rather</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.159" end="00:01:46.170" style="s2">counterintuitive and what I found</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">younger CSIS was that when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.170" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">combat scenario and you&#39;re with a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">platoon and you&#39;re trusting one another</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">with one another look one another&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">lives and you&#39;re in a context where</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:01:59.850" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re living and sleeping right</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">next to each other you&#39;re eating next to</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.850" end="00:02:04.020" style="s2">each other you&#39;re relying on one another</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">for emotional support and what&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.020" end="00:02:09.780" style="s2">that bubble and outside that perimeter</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:12.120" style="s2">is the threat of imminent danger that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.590" style="s2">that essentially mimics what would</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.120" end="00:02:16.019" style="s2">otherwise be</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.590" end="00:02:19.890" style="s2">a tribe in a more earlier</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.019" end="00:02:21.269" style="s2">hunter-gatherer epoch and for the modern</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.890" end="00:02:23.910" style="s2">mind that would have probably been one</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.269" end="00:02:27.690" style="s2">of the closest instances ever of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.910" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">experiencing that type of bonding so</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.690" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">youngers thesis is that what&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">making present returning veterans so</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:37.890" style="s2">disoriented it&#39;s not so much the amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:40.709" style="s2">of horror and traumas that they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.890" end="00:02:43.830" style="s2">exposed to rather it&#39;s the sharp and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.709" end="00:02:46.200" style="s2">jarring transition from being in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.830" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">sort of Band of Brothers moment back</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.200" end="00:02:52.739" style="s2">into 21st century alienating society</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2">where we&#39;re amongst a rather thin and</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.739" end="00:02:57.930" style="s2">consumer based society people are very</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">sort of atomic and individualistic in</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.930" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">their social relationships and it ends</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">up sort of being like the wolf that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:08.700" style="s2">lost its pack and in so doing people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:11.190" style="s2">lose their sense of identity and their</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.700" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">sense of meaning or purpose in relation</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.190" end="00:03:17.400" style="s2">to some sort of overarching group or</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:19.980" style="s2">overarching project and furthermore I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.400" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">would argue that I think it has bearing</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.980" end="00:03:26.250" style="s2">on a lot of the maybe groups of young</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:29.970" style="s2">men that are even older men that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.250" end="00:03:32.930" style="s2">feeling alienated in this sort of highly</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.970" end="00:03:37.859" style="s2">atomic post informational</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.930" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">post-industrial society that we&#39;re in so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.859" end="00:03:43.549" style="s2">not really sure what to do about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:47.069" style="s2">I don&#39;t think that we need something</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.549" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">like war or combat or life or death</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.069" end="00:03:51.750" style="s2">scenarios in order to be some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.660" style="s2">surrogate or proxy just for men to find</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.750" end="00:03:56.579" style="s2">solidarity or meaning or purpose in fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.660" end="00:03:58.950" style="s2">I think that&#39;s I mean that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.579" end="00:04:02.780" style="s2">the very narrative that Isis and and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.950" end="00:04:04.859" style="s2">lot of extremist groups are tapping into</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.780" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">I&#39;m sort of puzzling through this myself</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.859" end="00:04:10.799" style="s2">and you know I&#39;m hoping at least some</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.340" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">people would step up and begin leading</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.799" end="00:04:15.569" style="s2">and trying to to put together these</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:18.599" style="s2">types of things these types of groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.569" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">that that could express this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.599" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">mail and energy and and sense of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">and bonding in a way that could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:29.250" style="s2">productive and build social fabric</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:31.410" style="s2">in the absence of this I&#39;m worried</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.250" end="00:04:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one of two things will happen</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.410" end="00:04:36.870" style="s2">either men will continue to be more sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">of alienated and feeling without a place</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.870" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">or that energy that could be co-opted by</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:47.730" style="s2">more pernicious groups with a lot worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.350" end="00:04:49.410" style="s2">agendas I would end by saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.730" end="00:04:50.910" style="s2">scenario that I&#39;ve described or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.410" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">state of affairs that are described I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.910" end="00:04:54.780" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s endemic to soldiers I</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:57.950" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s just endemic to men I</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.780" end="00:05:02.940" style="s2">think it&#39;s endemic to really the post</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.950" end="00:05:05.490" style="s2">21st century person and what we really</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.940" end="00:05:07.890" style="s2">need to look at is our conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.490" end="00:05:10.230" style="s2">individual not as some sort of atomic</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.890" end="00:05:12.990" style="s2">entity the cleaved from all culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.230" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">cleaved from all history or cleave from</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.990" end="00:05:17.240" style="s2">all relations so I really understand the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:22.460" style="s2">individual is still important</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.240" end="00:05:27.450" style="s2">withstanding as in relation to a context</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.460" end="00:05:29.940" style="s2">to a family to friends to a history to</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.450" end="00:05:32.610" style="s2">it sort of social set of relations as</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.940" end="00:05:35.130" style="s2">opposed to this sort of Cartesian atomic</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.610" end="00:05:38.580" style="s2">individual that is not grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.130" end="00:05:43.050" style="s2">anything bigger than itself that&#39;s all I</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">get my name is David fuller I&#39;m a</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:48.290" style="s2">and I&#39;ve recently started teaching men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:50.760" style="s2">work and this is a bit of a story about</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.290" end="00:05:54.540" style="s2">how I got into men&#39;s work what I got out</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.760" end="00:05:55.740" style="s2">of it and it&#39;s about masculinity it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.540" end="00:05:58.260" style="s2">about my relationship with my father</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.740" end="00:06:01.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a very personal story but I hope</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.260" end="00:06:04.200" style="s2">that it&#39;s also in some way Universal</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.880" end="00:06:06.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve told it to people in the past it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.200" end="00:06:07.650" style="s2">sort of yeah it seems to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.150" end="00:06:10.950" style="s2">something quite deep in the experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.650" end="00:06:12.150" style="s2">of having a father and maybe not getting</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.950" end="00:06:14.670" style="s2">on so well with your father and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.150" end="00:06:16.410" style="s2">trying to rebuild that light that that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.670" end="00:06:19.170" style="s2">relationship and in the later years of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.410" end="00:06:23.820" style="s2">your life so we&#39;re going to pull back</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.170" end="00:06:26.880" style="s2">and start this story back in 2011 in</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.820" end="00:06:29.810" style="s2">Libya I used to be a foreign producer</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.880" end="00:06:33.360" style="s2">with channel 4 news Tripoli was falling</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.810" end="00:06:36.390" style="s2">Gaddafi was on the run we came into</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.360" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">Tripoli just as Gaddafi&#39;s regime was</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.390" end="00:06:38.780" style="s2">crumbling</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.110" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s guns going off people firing</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.520" end="00:06:55.870" style="s2">their this is center of Tripoli just as</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:57.280" style="s2">everything&#39;s going so yeah then so</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.870" end="00:06:59.470" style="s2">shortly after that we got to get out</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.280" end="00:07:01.720" style="s2">Gaddafi&#39;s tent this is the burnt-out</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.180" end="00:07:08.230" style="s2">going off people firing into the air</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.440" end="00:07:10.060" style="s2">it&#39;s just this incredible moment there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.230" end="00:07:11.710" style="s2">a few times in my journalistic career or</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.060" end="00:07:13.210" style="s2">I felt I&#39;m in the middle of history this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.710" end="00:07:16.060" style="s2">is just an extraordinary place an</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.210" end="00:07:17.920" style="s2">extraordinary experience and we had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.060" end="00:07:19.920" style="s2">satellite phone I thought I really want</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.920" end="00:07:22.000" style="s2">to share this so I called my parents</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.920" end="00:07:25.870" style="s2">called my mom and she answered the phone</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.000" end="00:07:27.910" style="s2">and I said listen listen to this just</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:31.540" style="s2">crazy crazy moment guns going off</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.910" end="00:07:40.570" style="s2">everywhere and she started crying and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.540" end="00:07:43.690" style="s2">said okay I&#39;m not in danger and she then</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.570" end="00:07:45.010" style="s2">said I&#39;m at the hospital with your dad</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.690" end="00:07:48.460" style="s2">he&#39;s just been diagnosed with stomach</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.770" end="00:07:54.130" style="s2">diagnosis of stomach cancer usually</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.330" end="00:07:59.260" style="s2">means it&#39;s pretty advanced and we think</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.130" end="00:08:00.940" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty bad and he he was young he</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.260" end="00:08:03.160" style="s2">was fit he&#39;d just been on cycling</p>

<p begin="00:08:06.760" end="00:08:12.490" style="s2">completely out of the blue and I knew it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.990" end="00:08:14.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t good I started crying as well on</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.490" end="00:08:17.290" style="s2">the phone and my bosses at Channel 4</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.680" end="00:08:21.550" style="s2">News thankfully just put me on a plane</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.290" end="00:08:22.900" style="s2">straight back to to the UK and so as</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.550" end="00:08:23.710" style="s2">we&#39;re in the plane going back to the UK</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.900" end="00:08:27.370" style="s2">I&#39;m just going to take a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.710" end="00:08:28.870" style="s2">digression and fill in the gaps because</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.370" end="00:08:34.599" style="s2">growing up I didn&#39;t get on well with my</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.870" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">father at all we always fought and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.599" end="00:08:39.969" style="s2">still didn&#39;t get on even in 2011 just</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:41.500" style="s2">before this happened and I to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.969" end="00:08:45.220" style="s2">I was I was a bit of a little shit to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.500" end="00:08:47.110" style="s2">him growing up I used to kind of take</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.220" end="00:08:48.459" style="s2">the piss out of him I used to there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.110" end="00:08:49.670" style="s2">a sort of conspiracy with my mother</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.459" end="00:08:52.910" style="s2">against him</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.670" end="00:08:54.890" style="s2">and I was I I never worked this out</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.910" end="00:08:56.630" style="s2">worked out why for a long time but I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.890" end="00:08:59.990" style="s2">really nasty to him and I push him I</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.630" end="00:09:01.700" style="s2">push him I push it and I I remember one</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.990" end="00:09:03.170" style="s2">time I pushed him so much that he</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.700" end="00:09:07.010" style="s2">grabbed me by my throat and held me up</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.170" end="00:09:08.780" style="s2">against the wall and it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.010" end="00:09:09.770" style="s2">sort of dawn on me until later and there</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.780" end="00:09:12.170" style="s2">was kind of a real sense of euphoria</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.770" end="00:09:13.910" style="s2">when I got when that happened as well it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.170" end="00:09:15.650" style="s2">never dawned on me until later why that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.910" end="00:09:18.650" style="s2">had happened it took me quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.650" end="00:09:20.210" style="s2">time to work it out and a lot of it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.650" end="00:09:21.470" style="s2">through the kind of the men&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.210" end="00:09:22.910" style="s2">the inner work that I&#39;d done after that</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.470" end="00:09:27.380" style="s2">that I sort of started to make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.910" end="00:09:29.810" style="s2">it so my parents were very left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.380" end="00:09:33.350" style="s2">very idealistic my childhood was like</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.810" end="00:09:34.850" style="s2">CND marchers delivering leaflets for the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.350" end="00:09:43.130" style="s2">Labour Party they were very rebellious</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.850" end="00:09:45.080" style="s2">as well and naturism now for about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.130" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">next couple of minutes I&#39;m gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.080" end="00:09:49.100" style="s2">speaking with a picture of my naked</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.580" end="00:09:54.500" style="s2">father behind me but it&#39;s what he would</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.100" end="00:09:57.830" style="s2">have wanted so my father was very much a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.500" end="00:09:59.300" style="s2">kind of new man he wanted to be very</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.830" end="00:10:02.330" style="s2">different from the male role models that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.300" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">he had and he wanted to kind of yeah be</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.330" end="00:10:07.910" style="s2">non-competitive and be be someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:13.070" style="s2">different from from his father and what</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.910" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">he&#39;d seen growing up very non competitor</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.070" end="00:10:16.340" style="s2">when we were played when we played</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:17.540" style="s2">football me and my brother he&#39;d say why</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.340" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">do you have to have a goal I can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.540" end="00:10:20.260" style="s2">pass it to each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.629" end="00:10:27.430" style="s2">and it took me a while but underneath he</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.509" end="00:10:29.110" style="s2">was he was really opinionated he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.430" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">really stubborn he always thought he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.110" end="00:10:36.790" style="s2">right very different from me everybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:39.250" style="s2">knows he lies and he could also get</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.790" end="00:10:40.689" style="s2">really really angry and want his own way</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.250" end="00:10:42.160" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s what I was doing when</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.689" end="00:10:44.319" style="s2">I pushed him just sort of pushing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.160" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">point like to say I know that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.319" end="00:10:48.220" style="s2">that that&#39;s not authentic that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">non competitive edge there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.220" end="00:10:53.500" style="s2">more there and I pushed him until he</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:55.209" style="s2">until he snapped until I found it and my</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.500" end="00:10:57.220" style="s2">mum told me later on that just that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.209" end="00:10:59.170" style="s2">moment really traumatized him like him</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.220" end="00:11:01.060" style="s2">really it took him a long time to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.170" end="00:11:02.920" style="s2">over that that that I pushed him to that</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.060" end="00:11:06.759" style="s2">point that he grabbed me and that he</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.920" end="00:11:09.670" style="s2">realized that he had that in him and it</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.759" end="00:11:11.290" style="s2">took it took a lot a lot of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.670" end="00:11:13.060" style="s2">transformational work after that where I</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.290" end="00:11:14.889" style="s2">started to really unpack the the anger</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.060" end="00:11:17.110" style="s2">that I had towards my father and to</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.889" end="00:11:18.490" style="s2">really kind of understand it and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.110" end="00:11:21.759" style="s2">recognize that all the things that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.490" end="00:11:23.709" style="s2">disliked in him I I had it I had all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.759" end="00:11:26.439" style="s2">those things in myself and was really</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.709" end="00:11:28.630" style="s2">able to kind of understand the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.439" end="00:11:33.910" style="s2">what what I was pushing out in him was</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.630" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">something that I also had because my my</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.910" end="00:11:38.920" style="s2">experience of men&#39;s work is that I can</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:40.959" style="s2">speak for myself as a man I have those</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.920" end="00:11:42.819" style="s2">those edges I have that aggression I</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.959" end="00:11:44.199" style="s2">have that wanting to be right I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.819" end="00:11:46.209" style="s2">that wanting to dominate I have all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.199" end="00:11:48.639" style="s2">these things that can come out and my</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.209" end="00:11:50.439" style="s2">experience is it&#39;s only through fully</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.639" end="00:11:53.649" style="s2">recognizing those and integrating them</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.439" end="00:11:56.199" style="s2">that I&#39;ve become more whole as a man to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.649" end="00:11:57.819" style="s2">to do what you could call the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.199" end="00:12:00.880" style="s2">work of really kind of looking at myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.819" end="00:12:02.730" style="s2">really deeply and then taking that anger</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.880" end="00:12:04.779" style="s2">taking that aggression and using it</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.730" end="00:12:07.029" style="s2">integrating it into the personality and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.779" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">then becoming sort of more more present</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.029" end="00:12:10.870" style="s2">more powerful it becomes I think once</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:12.699" style="s2">integrated a form of sort of personal</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.870" end="00:12:14.350" style="s2">power and becomes a kind of fuel for</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.699" end="00:12:18.189" style="s2">certainly to become a kind of fuel for</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.350" end="00:12:19.870" style="s2">my life and over probably since about</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.189" end="00:12:21.399" style="s2">2006 when I first started doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.870" end="00:12:23.559" style="s2">workshops and starting doing this work</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.399" end="00:12:26.529" style="s2">this sort of in a work from a place of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.559" end="00:12:27.699" style="s2">crisis in myself that I started to</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.529" end="00:12:31.449" style="s2">really kind of integrate some of these</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.699" end="00:12:32.889" style="s2">things and on some level I started to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.449" end="00:12:34.090" style="s2">heal at least some of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.889" end="00:12:35.950" style="s2">with him in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.090" end="00:12:37.770" style="s2">although at this point we haven&#39;t kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.950" end="00:12:42.810" style="s2">of healed it in the in the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.770" end="00:12:45.490" style="s2">so planes now about to land in in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.810" end="00:12:48.400" style="s2">and I go straight down to Southampton to</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.490" end="00:12:50.050" style="s2">see my dad in the hospital and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.400" end="00:12:52.900" style="s2">outside in the garden with my mom and a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.050" end="00:13:02.160" style="s2">family friend and I just go up to him</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.900" end="00:13:05.320" style="s2">and I embrace him and for my friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.160" end="00:13:07.390" style="s2">after a few minutes my friend takes this</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.320" end="00:13:11.410" style="s2">picture which is one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.390" end="00:13:14.590" style="s2">precious things I have in my life I</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.410" end="00:13:15.550" style="s2">think how probably lasted for about 10</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.590" end="00:13:18.460" style="s2">minutes it might have been even more</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.550" end="00:13:19.870" style="s2">sort of time stopped and my friend</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.460" end="00:13:21.660" style="s2">realized at some point that he was in</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.870" end="00:13:23.800" style="s2">the presence of something special and</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.660" end="00:13:29.110" style="s2">got his phone out and took this picture</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.800" end="00:13:30.790" style="s2">and something something I think very</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.110" end="00:13:32.290" style="s2">profound happened in that moment some</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.790" end="00:13:34.330" style="s2">kind of healing happens and I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.290" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">few friends who&#39;ve looked at this a</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.330" end="00:13:38.050" style="s2">friend of mine touched it up and has</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:40.000" style="s2">turned it into a picture I having my</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.050" end="00:13:41.770" style="s2">wall at home and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.000" end="00:13:43.660" style="s2">the way he&#39;s kind of collapsing into me</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.770" end="00:13:47.620" style="s2">and I&#39;m holding him that&#39;s a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.660" end="00:13:50.080" style="s2">transfer of some kind of I don&#39;t know as</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.620" end="00:13:52.450" style="s2">a child taking something and taking it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.080" end="00:13:53.950" style="s2">from my father that that from what then</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.450" end="00:13:57.220" style="s2">happened I feel that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.950" end="00:13:59.800" style="s2">happened in that moment and I think what</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.220" end="00:14:01.860" style="s2">happened here catalyzed a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.800" end="00:14:04.780" style="s2">happened next</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.860" end="00:14:06.370" style="s2">because shortly after that he got the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.780" end="00:14:13.780" style="s2">diagnosis and he was diagnosed with</p>

<p begin="00:17:43.800" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s often I told this sort of over</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.809" end="00:17:50.040" style="s2">the last few years and this is normally</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:56.790" style="s2">where it ends and it&#39;s but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.040" end="00:17:58.679" style="s2">where it ends because as someone who had</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.790" end="00:18:00.990" style="s2">I believed my father&#39;s image of himself</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.679" end="00:18:02.760" style="s2">like I I treated him as this failure</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.990" end="00:18:04.140" style="s2">growing up I&#39;d realized that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.760" end="00:18:05.370" style="s2">turn alized the story that he hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.140" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">treated him the same way to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.370" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">treated himself and then to have all of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:12.570" style="s2">this come on at the age of 36 to realize</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:14.130" style="s2">by the time he was my age he&#39;d opened at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.570" end="00:18:15.720" style="s2">Art Center he saved a theater he&#39;d</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.720" end="00:18:21.510" style="s2">had three kids it&#39;s like oh this guy I</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.710" end="00:18:24.059" style="s2">thought was a failure at a chief farm or</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.510" end="00:18:25.500" style="s2">that that stage that I had and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.059" end="00:18:27.960" style="s2">also something that in my experience</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.500" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">when your father goes as a man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.960" end="00:18:30.870" style="s2">there&#39;s something archetypal even though</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get on that well my father</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.870" end="00:18:35.070" style="s2">there&#39;s something there that&#39;s missing</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">this sort of archetypal grounding point</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.070" end="00:18:39.090" style="s2">and I really found that I had to go on a</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:42.720" style="s2">journey of myself over the next sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.090" end="00:18:44.610" style="s2">six months to really find my path and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.720" end="00:18:46.590" style="s2">find what I needed to do and it was it</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.610" end="00:18:50.220" style="s2">then became like the hardest period of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.590" end="00:18:51.720" style="s2">my life like I had some real ups and</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.220" end="00:18:52.860" style="s2">downs over the last six years just</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.720" end="00:18:54.360" style="s2">really trying to get my shit together</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.860" end="00:18:56.190" style="s2">and decide what it was that was meant to</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.360" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">be doing with my life and what I was</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.490" end="00:19:10.340" style="s2">feel that I&#39;ve really started to come</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:13.130" style="s2">out of that and realize what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.340" end="00:19:18.380" style="s2">I&#39;m supposed to be doing and it&#39;s sort</p>

<p begin="00:21:00.280" end="00:21:05.410" style="s2">decade ago and we were sat in a loft and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:08.770" style="s2">there was a group of us about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.410" end="00:21:10.570" style="s2">seventeen eighteen of us and we&#39;d all</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.770" end="00:21:13.420" style="s2">been doing the type of men&#39;s work that</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.570" end="00:21:16.540" style="s2">David was describing that process of</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.980" end="00:21:23.410" style="s2">meaning and purpose and we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.030" end="00:21:26.680" style="s2">this work for about four or five years</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.410" end="00:21:29.710" style="s2">and we felt a huge amount better about</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.680" end="00:21:32.590" style="s2">ourselves but as we sat there in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.710" end="00:21:35.680" style="s2">loft in Hove we realized that if if</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.590" end="00:21:39.400" style="s2">there is a crisis in masculinity it</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.680" end="00:21:41.470" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really amongst us because we were</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.400" end="00:21:45.550" style="s2">pretty white pretty middle-class and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.470" end="00:21:49.270" style="s2">pretty privileged and that maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.550" end="00:21:51.160" style="s2">maybe if we were to set about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.270" end="00:21:54.520" style="s2">do something to address some problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.160" end="00:21:57.070" style="s2">that we saw in society where we should</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.520" end="00:22:00.190" style="s2">be focusing our efforts was in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.070" end="00:22:03.670" style="s2">council estates where we knew that young</p>

<p begin="00:22:10.390" end="00:22:16.060" style="s2">when they went in and what would it be</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.030" end="00:22:21.060" style="s2">like for us to set ourselves the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.060" end="00:22:23.860" style="s2">challenge of reaching out a hand to them</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.060" end="00:22:29.370" style="s2">going back to the ancient ancient</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.860" end="00:22:33.030" style="s2">traditions of the older men in a society</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.370" end="00:22:37.510" style="s2">believing it to be their responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.030" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">their sacred charge to initiate the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.510" end="00:22:44.260" style="s2">younger men to say to the younger men</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:47.160" style="s2">this is how we do stuff around here this</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.260" end="00:22:50.820" style="s2">is what we expect from you</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.160" end="00:22:53.570" style="s2">and in return this is what you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.820" end="00:22:57.330" style="s2">expect from us it&#39;s not a one-way street</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.570" end="00:22:59.550" style="s2">being a man in this tribe and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.330" end="00:23:01.890" style="s2">believed that that that that social</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.550" end="00:23:03.810" style="s2">contract that bond had been lost and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.890" end="00:23:07.320" style="s2">what would it be like if we try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.810" end="00:23:10.650" style="s2">recreate that so that was ten years ago</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.320" end="00:23:14.430" style="s2">and what I&#39;m going to do now is show you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.650" end="00:23:16.170" style="s2">and allow you to hear the voices of some</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.430" end="00:23:18.480" style="s2">of the young men and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.170" end="00:23:21.180" style="s2">volunteers that we&#39;ve worked with over</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.480" end="00:23:23.310" style="s2">the past decade and then I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.180" end="00:23:25.800" style="s2">return and talk a bit about what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.310" end="00:23:29.730" style="s2">learned in the ten years that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.800" end="00:23:31.350" style="s2">doing this work well if you think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.730" end="00:23:33.980" style="s2">communities in the safety of communities</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.350" end="00:23:37.110" style="s2">they&#39;re most sort of at risk through</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.980" end="00:23:38.940" style="s2">unsocialized young men I remember seeing</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.110" end="00:23:40.860" style="s2">my dad going down the road from his</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.940" end="00:23:43.860" style="s2">house when he had passed and I was there</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.860" end="00:23:45.210" style="s2">and I&#39;m bogged down about it I got put</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.860" end="00:23:48.990" style="s2">in the cell and I said I&#39;ll never do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.210" end="00:23:51.690" style="s2">again then I got done it again and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.990" end="00:23:54.480" style="s2">ended up back in the cell I don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.690" end="00:23:58.850" style="s2">at a to become man it&#39;s just one of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.480" end="00:24:02.600" style="s2">things we as a community of men</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.850" end="00:24:06.630" style="s2">recognized that all of us are wounded</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.600" end="00:24:07.920" style="s2">all of us have our own issues all of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.630" end="00:24:10.110" style="s2">are struggling to answer the big</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.920" end="00:24:12.870" style="s2">questions of life of Who am I really</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.110" end="00:24:15.630" style="s2">what should I do with my life and is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.870" end="00:24:18.150" style="s2">there really any meaning or purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.630" end="00:24:20.460" style="s2">we engage in those questions with the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.150" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">young men but I&#39;m living the new life</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.460" end="00:24:23.960" style="s2">that I always wanted to live</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.590" end="00:24:28.770" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.600" end="00:24:38.540" style="s2">so what we do is we take young men</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.150" end="00:24:41.880" style="s2">referrals from the Probation Service and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.540" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">we approach them and we offer them the</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.880" end="00:24:46.970" style="s2">call to adventure do you want to come</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:49.920" style="s2">and see what what maybe is behind and</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.970" end="00:24:54.420" style="s2">driving what what what what your life</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.920" end="00:24:56.670" style="s2">looks like and those young men have</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.420" end="00:25:00.660" style="s2">often never had an invitation quite like</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.670" end="00:25:01.860" style="s2">that we take them away to the woods we</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.660" end="00:25:03.960" style="s2">take them off to the woods</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.860" end="00:25:07.950" style="s2">we take them away from their known world</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.960" end="00:25:10.790" style="s2">and surrounding those 10 or 12 men on</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.950" end="00:25:14.790" style="s2">those rites of passage weekends are</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.790" end="00:25:20.190" style="s2">twenty five grown men from their</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.790" end="00:25:23.220" style="s2">community we set out with a belief and a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.190" end="00:25:26.100" style="s2">hypothesis that what the young men were</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.220" end="00:25:29.490" style="s2">looking for was meaning purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.100" end="00:25:32.880" style="s2">belonging meaning purpose and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.490" end="00:25:35.850" style="s2">and that was certainly borne out and for</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.880" end="00:25:39.050" style="s2">too many men in this country there is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.850" end="00:25:41.670" style="s2">absence of meaning purpose and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.050" end="00:25:44.190" style="s2">what we didn&#39;t realize when we started</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.670" end="00:25:47.160" style="s2">doing this was how much our older male</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.190" end="00:25:50.420" style="s2">volunteers were also in desperately in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.160" end="00:25:53.040" style="s2">need of meaning purpose and belonging</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.420" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">and that bringing those two groups</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.040" end="00:26:02.160" style="s2">together has been deeply deeply healing</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:26:04.980" style="s2">because instinctively I felt scared of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.160" end="00:26:07.080" style="s2">young men I still notice it come up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.980" end="00:26:09.450" style="s2">me occasionally even now even after</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.080" end="00:26:12.060" style="s2">doing this work for years and years I</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.450" end="00:26:14.460" style="s2">walk past a group of males in hoodies at</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.060" end="00:26:18.900" style="s2">a bus bus stop and part of me will feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.460" end="00:26:21.530" style="s2">scared and yet now chances are I might</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.900" end="00:26:21.530" style="s2">know one of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:30.520" style="s2">another thing that we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.580" end="00:26:33.310" style="s2">that one of the jewels spoke earlier</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.520" end="00:26:35.380" style="s2">about the stiff upper lip the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.310" end="00:26:38.350" style="s2">the traditions of the upper-class</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.380" end="00:26:40.900" style="s2">Englishmen that started perhaps with</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.350" end="00:26:43.510" style="s2">that sentiment of the definition of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.900" end="00:26:47.860" style="s2">boor is an Englishman who when you ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.510" end="00:26:50.200" style="s2">him how he is he actually tells you so</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.860" end="00:26:52.120" style="s2">that there&#39;s that kind of thing that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.200" end="00:26:54.640" style="s2">that we heard about that boarding school</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.120" end="00:26:57.280" style="s2">of environment of never showing any fear</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.640" end="00:26:59.560" style="s2">and you know what it&#39;s the same for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.280" end="00:27:02.200" style="s2">young men growing up on the council</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.560" end="00:27:04.810" style="s2">estates going to the going to prisons</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.200" end="00:27:08.260" style="s2">like being in those environments they</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.810" end="00:27:15.100" style="s2">are not the only emotion that they can</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.260" end="00:27:20.680" style="s2">show is anger grief and sadness no fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.100" end="00:27:23.110" style="s2">no like love and joy no so their</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.680" end="00:27:24.820" style="s2">emotional range a lot of the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.110" end="00:27:27.630" style="s2">range of men and young men gets</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.820" end="00:27:30.340" style="s2">channeled into a very very narrow funnel</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.630" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">so we see that the work that we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.340" end="00:27:36.460" style="s2">in allowing men and young men to improve</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:39.160" style="s2">their emotional literacy to express the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.460" end="00:27:41.140" style="s2">grief the sadness the shame that fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.160" end="00:27:43.810" style="s2">that might have been inside them for</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.140" end="00:27:48.340" style="s2">years without finding ground we believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.810" end="00:27:51.220" style="s2">is really really important the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.340" end="00:27:55.270" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re finding is that men</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.220" end="00:27:57.400" style="s2">need community and I used to say to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.270" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">funders and people that came down to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.400" end="00:28:01.300" style="s2">our work I used to tell them that this</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:04.570" style="s2">is my community this isn&#39;t just a youth</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.300" end="00:28:06.660" style="s2">project this is my community these men</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.570" end="00:28:11.020" style="s2">in this community will bury me when I go</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.660" end="00:28:14.230" style="s2">and that was always a kind of it was a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.020" end="00:28:15.820" style="s2">it was a construct but last year what</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.230" end="00:28:18.850" style="s2">happened is that one of those men that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.820" end="00:28:22.660" style="s2">was sat in that room with us in Hove ten</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.850" end="00:28:28.120" style="s2">years ago died I&#39;ll bring his name here</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.660" end="00:28:32.980" style="s2">tonight Peter and Peter died and we as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.120" end="00:28:33.789" style="s2">community held held that process held</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.980" end="00:28:37.059" style="s2">his</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.789" end="00:28:40.809" style="s2">you know the young men the young man</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.059" end="00:28:42.789" style="s2">that he first mentored went up to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.809" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">woodland burial site and was part of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.789" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">group of men digging the grave that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:51.039" style="s2">would hold that man telling stories of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">what they remembered and what they</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.039" end="00:28:59.019" style="s2">celebrated about Peter Wow</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:29:02.289" style="s2">that sent ripples right through our</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.019" end="00:29:04.929" style="s2">community knowing that that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.289" end="00:29:09.369" style="s2">look after each other that&#39;s how we look</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.929" end="00:29:11.889" style="s2">after our own so whilst we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.369" end="00:29:14.259" style="s2">social good we&#39;re also getting a huge</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.889" end="00:29:16.840" style="s2">amount of value for ourselves and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.259" end="00:29:20.889" style="s2">for me is what what service really looks</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.840" end="00:29:23.190" style="s2">like and I&#39;ll leave you there thank you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.889" end="00:29:23.190" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.739" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">what&#39;s the value of having groups of</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.479" end="00:29:34.989" style="s2">just men because some of what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:36.849" style="s2">talking about is kind of sharing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.989" end="00:29:38.679" style="s2">vulnerability in that that can happen in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.849" end="00:29:42.899" style="s2">different kinds of groups can it so what</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.679" end="00:29:42.899" style="s2">is the value of doing it with just men</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.139" end="00:29:49.509" style="s2">there&#39;s two parts to it really one is</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.820" end="00:29:52.619" style="s2">that what will happen in in Akko gender</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.509" end="00:29:55.389" style="s2">group is that as a heterosexual man I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.619" end="00:29:59.559" style="s2">will start to try and establish some</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.389" end="00:30:00.879" style="s2">rank because I&#39;ll be aware of aware of</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.559" end="00:30:02.999" style="s2">which of the women that I want to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.879" end="00:30:05.229" style="s2">with and I want to look good and that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.999" end="00:30:06.729" style="s2">will mean that I&#39;m showing up in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.229" end="00:30:10.149" style="s2">different way too if I wasn&#39;t doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.729" end="00:30:14.349" style="s2">and I feel quite embarrassed admitting</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.149" end="00:30:16.059" style="s2">to this but that&#39;s how it works and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.349" end="00:30:19.470" style="s2">there&#39;s also something that&#39;s a bit kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.059" end="00:30:22.359" style="s2">of subtler than that which is that what</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.470" end="00:30:24.489" style="s2">I do Co gender work I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.359" end="00:30:27.309" style="s2">absolutely a place for doing Co gender</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.489" end="00:30:30.099" style="s2">work especially in the times of me - I</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.309" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">believe there is a massive need for men</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.099" end="00:30:36.220" style="s2">and women to hear each other&#39;s stories</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.340" end="00:30:38.769" style="s2">going beyond the stereotypes beyond all</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.220" end="00:30:41.799" style="s2">of the kind of stuff I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.769" end="00:30:43.720" style="s2">absolute you need for that and what can</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.799" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">sometimes happen in Co gender groups is</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.720" end="00:30:47.770" style="s2">that I will expect</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:50.110" style="s2">unconsciously the men will expect the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.770" end="00:30:54.490" style="s2">women in the group to do the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.110" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">stereotypically feminine emotions so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.490" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">men will expect the women to hold the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:02.920" style="s2">vulnerability the sadness the grief and</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:06.190" style="s2">and and it can become polarizing whereas</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.920" end="00:31:08.380" style="s2">when it&#39;s an all-male group we find</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.190" end="00:31:10.570" style="s2">ourselves manifesting and experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.380" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">those emotions demonstrating them</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.570" end="00:31:14.950" style="s2">modeling for the young men that we can</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:19.090" style="s2">be in an authentic space of masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.950" end="00:31:21.190" style="s2">and in those emotions and you know at</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.090" end="00:31:24.340" style="s2">the weekend we do all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.190" end="00:31:26.200" style="s2">that&#39;s traditionally seen as in our</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.340" end="00:31:28.570" style="s2">polarized gendered society is being</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.200" end="00:31:30.040" style="s2">feminine so we cook and we clean and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.570" end="00:31:31.809" style="s2">look after the young men and we&#39;d clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.040" end="00:31:34.030" style="s2">their plates and we do all of that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.809" end="00:31:37.750" style="s2">because they&#39;ve often never experienced</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.030" end="00:31:40.360" style="s2">being nurtured by by other men and often</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.750" end="00:31:43.330" style="s2">they don&#39;t don&#39;t see they don&#39;t honor</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.360" end="00:31:45.790" style="s2">that part within themselves so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.330" end="00:31:49.900" style="s2">kind of why we why we do it as a single</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.790" end="00:31:52.090" style="s2">gender groups yeah it&#39;s a really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.900" end="00:31:53.890" style="s2">question and I would say there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.090" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">couple of things I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.890" end="00:31:59.020" style="s2">with Nathan that when a woman enters the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:32:00.340" style="s2">room men&#39;s behavior changes it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.020" end="00:32:02.980" style="s2">it&#39;s just something that happens on a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.340" end="00:32:05.679" style="s2">very subtle level and performance comes</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.980" end="00:32:07.720" style="s2">in or whatever it&#39;s a there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.679" end="00:32:09.250" style="s2">of inauthenticity that can come in very</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.720" end="00:32:10.750" style="s2">easily but also I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.250" end="00:32:12.940" style="s2">something that we can give to each other</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.750" end="00:32:15.520" style="s2">as men that that really feeds us on a on</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.940" end="00:32:18.970" style="s2">a deep level someone&#39;s called it the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.520" end="00:32:21.160" style="s2">vitamin M that we&#39;re all craving for on</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.970" end="00:32:22.990" style="s2">some level and I&#39;ve this is a really</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.160" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">bodily ID I think you probably agree</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.990" end="00:32:27.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a bodily experience of some kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:28.390" style="s2">of sustenance that comes in I&#39;m sure is</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.280" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">related to kind of this deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.390" end="00:32:34.600" style="s2">evolutionary history of being around men</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:37.300" style="s2">and doing things together with men and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.600" end="00:32:38.860" style="s2">it&#39;s a real felt sense it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.300" end="00:32:42.010" style="s2">don&#39;t know that you&#39;re missing this but</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.860" end="00:32:44.140" style="s2">you are and and that that really comes</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.010" end="00:32:47.500" style="s2">in I think in that in that space it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.140" end="00:32:50.020" style="s2">like I&#39;m on a much deeper level we knew</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.500" end="00:32:52.420" style="s2">when we started doing this well we had a</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.020" end="00:32:56.830" style="s2">suspicion that the young men would</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.420" end="00:32:59.650" style="s2">really value an older man blessing them</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.830" end="00:33:04.020" style="s2">looking them in the eyes and going what</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.650" end="00:33:06.250" style="s2">I see in you young man is a fine soul</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.020" end="00:33:07.930" style="s2">somebody who really cares about those</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.250" end="00:33:09.400" style="s2">around them has somebody who this you</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.930" end="00:33:11.350" style="s2">know so it&#39;s a really blessing them and</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.400" end="00:33:13.210" style="s2">we were absolutely spot on in that and</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.350" end="00:33:18.520" style="s2">that means a huge amount to the young</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.210" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">men what we didn&#39;t realize was how much</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.520" end="00:33:27.070" style="s2">we as older men were craving the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:27.750" style="s2">blessing of the younger men for them to</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.070" end="00:33:30.970" style="s2">say to us</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.750" end="00:33:35.860" style="s2">chi noir nobody&#39;s ever cared about me</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.970" end="00:33:39.670" style="s2">and you lot have thank you it was just</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.860" end="00:33:43.330" style="s2">like wow like that that just meant so</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.670" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">much and and and and we didn&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.330" end="00:33:48.220" style="s2">coming</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:49.510" style="s2">I would certainly very much like to hear</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.220" end="00:33:52.150" style="s2">from some of the women in the room about</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.510" end="00:33:53.680" style="s2">what their feelings are listening to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.150" end="00:33:56.800" style="s2">some of the stories that have been</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.680" end="00:33:58.510" style="s2">shared or yeah some of the experiences</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.800" end="00:34:00.850" style="s2">or what what&#39;s come up for them in terms</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.510" end="00:34:03.790" style="s2">of hearing some of the things that been</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.850" end="00:34:05.590" style="s2">shared tonight I would like to say that</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.620" end="00:34:16.720" style="s2">you personally and I think that is what</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.890" end="00:34:19.620" style="s2">a lot of women are missing out on</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.720" end="00:34:24.160" style="s2">frankly when they&#39;re talking to men in</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.620" end="00:34:27.429" style="s2">talk to a boss talk to colleague we</p>

<p begin="00:34:47.550" end="00:34:52.679" style="s2">to see whether whether or not there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.490" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">anything women can do to support men to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.679" end="00:34:58.680" style="s2">help them have a more positive healthier</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:01.590" style="s2">kind of version of masculinity or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.680" end="00:35:03.690" style="s2">whether we should just like step back do</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.590" end="00:35:05.850" style="s2">you know what I mean so I wanted to hear</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.690" end="00:35:07.770" style="s2">from men and I guess I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.850" end="00:35:08.130" style="s2">hear maybe from you guys what you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.770" end="00:35:11.070" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.130" end="00:35:14.130" style="s2">what met what women can do to support</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.070" end="00:35:16.950" style="s2">this I suppose I mean what I&#39;d say for</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.130" end="00:35:19.110" style="s2">myself is that through really connecting</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.950" end="00:35:23.100" style="s2">to my masculinity and the work has</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.110" end="00:35:25.230" style="s2">really enabled me to connect with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.100" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">women in my life I mean the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.230" end="00:35:27.870" style="s2">terminology is to connect with the</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.010" style="s2">feminine like connection to my Maskin</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.870" end="00:35:30.840" style="s2">has allowed me really to connect with</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.010" end="00:35:33.060" style="s2">the feminine and I feel that&#39;s in myself</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.840" end="00:35:34.440" style="s2">as well as outside it&#39;s it&#39;s rooting</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.060" end="00:35:35.640" style="s2">myself really into my masculine has</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.710" end="00:35:47.370" style="s2">there is something that we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:52.080" style="s2">for ourselves yeah in terms of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.370" end="00:35:55.110" style="s2">growing out of my toxic model of</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.080" end="00:35:57.600" style="s2">masculinity of my early 20s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.110" end="00:36:02.280" style="s2">friendship of women was so crucial to</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.600" end="00:36:05.640" style="s2">that I mean I would say even now I</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.280" end="00:36:08.490" style="s2">probably got more close female friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.640" end="00:36:12.510" style="s2">the male because it was just easier to</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.490" end="00:36:16.710" style="s2">have authentic you know conversations</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.510" end="00:36:20.310" style="s2">with them but I think that David&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.710" end="00:36:21.960" style="s2">that it can&#39;t be just that I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.310" end="00:36:26.760" style="s2">think I still have issues around</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.960" end="00:36:30.210" style="s2">trusting men and and opening up with men</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.760" end="00:36:32.550" style="s2">and so there is I I kind of been</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.210" end="00:36:34.620" style="s2">converted by these guys to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.550" end="00:36:37.290" style="s2">there is there is some good work to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.620" end="00:36:38.850" style="s2">done you know with I&#39;d have never been</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.290" end="00:36:42.900" style="s2">to a men&#39;s group but I mean I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.850" end="00:36:44.190" style="s2">open to the idea yeah this that there is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.900" end="00:36:49.830" style="s2">that there is a kind of healing in terms</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.190" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">of trusting other men as well I made a</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.830" end="00:36:56.520" style="s2">really bad mistake which was a female</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:58.110" style="s2">friend of mine and I were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.520" end="00:37:04.890" style="s2">the me to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.110" end="00:37:08.820" style="s2">and she said to me you men all have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.890" end="00:37:10.650" style="s2">problem you need to sort this out and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.820" end="00:37:13.890" style="s2">was just like huh</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.650" end="00:37:15.840" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t approach a person of Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.890" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">faith and say do you Muslims have got a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.840" end="00:37:19.830" style="s2">real problem with like you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:21.900" style="s2">extremism in your community you all need</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.830" end="00:37:23.760" style="s2">to sort it out so what why do you think</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.900" end="00:37:25.650" style="s2">that all men are responsible for the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.760" end="00:37:27.900" style="s2">actions of extremists like Harvey</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.650" end="00:37:29.190" style="s2">Weinstein within our community that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.900" end="00:37:31.290" style="s2">not to say that we don&#39;t have issues</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.190" end="00:37:32.730" style="s2">around sex and stuff that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.290" end="00:37:35.370" style="s2">work through but there is something in</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.730" end="00:37:37.770" style="s2">that because what I missed in that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.370" end="00:37:39.510" style="s2">the opportunity to say to her because</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.770" end="00:37:41.370" style="s2">what she went on to disclose was the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.510" end="00:37:42.990" style="s2">actually she being a sexually assaulted</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.370" end="00:37:44.580" style="s2">when she was younger and that still</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.990" end="00:37:46.740" style="s2">carried a lot of stuff around it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.580" end="00:37:50.940" style="s2">because of how the conversation had gone</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.740" end="00:37:52.770" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get to say to her I that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.940" end="00:37:56.460" style="s2">wrong and I&#39;m sorry that that happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.770" end="00:37:58.440" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t get to grieve with her for</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.460" end="00:38:01.680" style="s2">what was lost in the moment because I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.440" end="00:38:03.630" style="s2">was too in my own reaction around like</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.680" end="00:38:05.910" style="s2">all of you men and carrying the burden</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.630" end="00:38:09.870" style="s2">and the shame of all of that collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.910" end="00:38:12.060" style="s2">stuff so yeah that would be the other</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.870" end="00:38:13.800" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve turned a more serious no to</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.060" end="00:38:15.270" style="s2">you know for all of us as human beings</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.800" end="00:38:17.190" style="s2">to look when we&#39;re generalizing and one</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.270" end="00:38:21.990" style="s2">we&#39;re giving somebody stuff that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.190" end="00:38:24.090" style="s2">theirs - one yep essentially one for you</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.990" end="00:38:26.370" style="s2">David and I was really moved by your</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.090" end="00:38:28.680" style="s2">story and I was wondering if you have</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.370" end="00:38:31.620" style="s2">any ideas or thoughts about how that</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.680" end="00:38:34.050" style="s2">sort of approach Minh or how that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.620" end="00:38:35.730" style="s2">changing that relation can happen before</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.050" end="00:38:38.610" style="s2">before it gets at that stage as it were</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.730" end="00:38:40.410" style="s2">and because I think many people would</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.610" end="00:38:41.640" style="s2">rather it is often left to that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.410" end="00:38:42.990" style="s2">lateness isn&#39;t it and that actually you</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.640" end="00:38:44.910" style="s2">won&#39;t see it before now I have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.990" end="00:38:46.080" style="s2">do this my own father had that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.910" end="00:38:48.390" style="s2">deep in musical conversation I think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.080" end="00:38:50.720" style="s2">just found it bit awkward and weird and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.390" end="00:38:53.010" style="s2">wasn&#39;t really willing to go there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.720" end="00:38:54.840" style="s2">for me it would seem a shame to leave it</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.010" end="00:38:58.800" style="s2">to that same stage when it&#39;s so so late</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.840" end="00:39:01.350" style="s2">in the day yeah very good question yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.800" end="00:39:04.830" style="s2">I wish it hadn&#39;t been sparked by that</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.350" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">and by that shortened timespan and made</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.830" end="00:39:09.320" style="s2">it all more intense</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:14.930" style="s2">there&#39;s only so much you can do you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.530" end="00:39:17.030" style="s2">only offer you can&#39;t you can&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.930" end="00:39:18.740" style="s2">the way it&#39;s received there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.030" end="00:39:20.150" style="s2">a course that I did once that said and</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.740" end="00:39:21.950" style="s2">it was about kind of healing with your</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.150" end="00:39:28.100" style="s2">parents and what they said is open the</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.950" end="00:39:30.710" style="s2">conversation by saying I love you and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.100" end="00:39:35.150" style="s2">know that you&#39;ve always loved me and</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.710" end="00:39:36.620" style="s2">that that recognition of of their their</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.150" end="00:39:40.070" style="s2">love was that was the thing that would</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.620" end="00:39:45.260" style="s2">open the door and it worked I think I</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.070" end="00:39:46.430" style="s2">said it&#39;s my mom she said I know but I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.260" end="00:39:47.630" style="s2">already said that to my dad and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.430" end="00:39:52.970" style="s2">hadn&#39;t kind of it haven&#39;t fixed the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.630" end="00:39:56.420" style="s2">relationship so there&#39;s often there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.970" end="00:39:59.120" style="s2">always more work to do in ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.420" end="00:40:00.860" style="s2">well there&#39;s often stuff that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.120" end="00:40:02.450" style="s2">we it&#39;s difficult to know whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.860" end="00:40:04.760" style="s2">really coming from a resolve place in</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.450" end="00:40:06.470" style="s2">ourselves and then whether we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.760" end="00:40:09.410" style="s2">actually come from that that place of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.470" end="00:40:10.700" style="s2">healing my relationship improved a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.410" end="00:40:11.890" style="s2">with my dad when I was in a really bad</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.700" end="00:40:15.050" style="s2">accident</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.890" end="00:40:22.580" style="s2">so we bonded through that any major</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.050" end="00:40:24.200" style="s2">injury yeah on this one I feel because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.580" end="00:40:26.840" style="s2">have such a great relationship with my</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.200" end="00:40:29.620" style="s2">dad I mean we have some incredibly deep</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.840" end="00:40:32.840" style="s2">conversations about the weather and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.620" end="00:40:36.470" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna happen in the next 48 hours</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.840" end="00:40:37.880" style="s2">meteor odd meteor logically and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.470" end="00:40:41.900" style="s2">what he&#39;s just not ready for those</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.880" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">conversations anything deeper and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.900" end="00:40:48.020" style="s2">know what I&#39;ve come to to accept is is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:51.110" style="s2">couple of things really one is that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:53.630" style="s2">all want a Superman for for our fathers</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.110" end="00:40:55.220" style="s2">and what we get is a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.630" end="00:40:57.560" style="s2">that&#39;s so that&#39;s that you know some</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.220" end="00:40:59.570" style="s2">stuff to work through and the other the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.560" end="00:41:04.790" style="s2">other thing for me as well is to accept</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.570" end="00:41:07.510" style="s2">that like my dad&#39;s dad went off to war</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.790" end="00:41:09.980" style="s2">in the second world war came back</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.510" end="00:41:11.360" style="s2">couldn&#39;t really speak about it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.980" end="00:41:14.570" style="s2">ever speak about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.360" end="00:41:17.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t ever really parent my dad and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.570" end="00:41:19.520" style="s2">he is who he is and I ended up who I am</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.240" end="00:41:21.920" style="s2">and that perhaps our generation of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.520" end="00:41:22.470" style="s2">ones with the tools that we used to just</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.920" end="00:41:24.890" style="s2">gently</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.470" end="00:41:28.920" style="s2">try and unlock every now and again but</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.890" end="00:41:31.890" style="s2">wait if it&#39;s right and hopefully it</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.920" end="00:41:35.430" style="s2">won&#39;t be the three months to go stage</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.890" end="00:41:37.170" style="s2">that David was yeah I think it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.430" end="00:41:38.820" style="s2">difficult to create a relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.170" end="00:41:39.140" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have anywhere else in his</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.820" end="00:41:41.099" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:42.840" style="s2">like it&#39;s very difficult to create a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.099" end="00:41:44.970" style="s2">closer relationship than any of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.840" end="00:41:48.720" style="s2">other relationships that that someone</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.970" end="00:41:51.740" style="s2">has that&#39;s very difficult and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.720" end="00:41:54.300" style="s2">ask you about Superman this word came up</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.740" end="00:41:57.390" style="s2">thanks all of you for sharing such</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.300" end="00:41:59.310" style="s2">swords being so courageous I&#39;m gonna use</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.390" end="00:42:00.930" style="s2">that word being vulnerable and sharing a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.310" end="00:42:03.000" style="s2">little bit of your own honest truths and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.930" end="00:42:06.150" style="s2">stories that&#39;s really moved me and being</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.000" end="00:42:08.340" style="s2">something quite powerful to encounter</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.150" end="00:42:11.849" style="s2">I guess I&#39;m interested to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.340" end="00:42:14.849" style="s2">personally as as men fellow men what you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.849" end="00:42:18.270" style="s2">do about your urge to fix the world or</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.849" end="00:42:20.400" style="s2">to try and be a Superman to solve things</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.270" end="00:42:23.160" style="s2">to have the answer to build a program</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.400" end="00:42:26.820" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna be you know the thing and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.160" end="00:42:29.250" style="s2">maybe this is a kind of a man problem I</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.820" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know or is it okay how do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.250" end="00:42:37.410" style="s2">about that I have had that I definitely</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:40.339" style="s2">see it in my brother as well young</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.410" end="00:42:43.619" style="s2">called it like the archetype of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.339" end="00:42:46.200" style="s2">eternal boy like the golden child who</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.619" end="00:42:48.599" style="s2">were kind of on a mission to save the</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.200" end="00:42:51.450" style="s2">world and and men can be very into hero</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.599" end="00:42:53.190" style="s2">archetypes and personal development can</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.450" end="00:42:57.180" style="s2">really draw on that as well like you go</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.190" end="00:42:59.640" style="s2">on a hero&#39;s journey and so forth and I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.180" end="00:43:01.109" style="s2">still feel it in me sometimes as well</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.640" end="00:43:05.880" style="s2">you know what am I going to do to set</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.109" end="00:43:08.369" style="s2">the world on fire and I guess one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.880" end="00:43:11.190" style="s2">I can do is recognize that sometimes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.369" end="00:43:14.369" style="s2">real work is accepting yourself when you</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.190" end="00:43:18.119" style="s2">haven&#39;t done something amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.369" end="00:43:21.119" style="s2">you&#39;re not on some massive mission so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.119" end="00:43:23.010" style="s2">that can be the hardest work when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.119" end="00:43:24.660" style="s2">not kind of caffeined up and thinking ah</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.010" end="00:43:25.480" style="s2">this this is going to be the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.660" end="00:43:29.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.480" end="00:43:31.519" style="s2">so yeah I think just recognizing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.000" end="00:43:35.299" style="s2">tendency in oneself and then it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.519" end="00:43:36.710" style="s2">form of unkindness to one because you</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.299" end="00:43:38.809" style="s2">know like Who am I when I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.710" end="00:43:42.140" style="s2">superhero when I&#39;m when I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.809" end="00:43:48.829" style="s2">amazing and can I accept myself in that</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.140" end="00:43:49.220" style="s2">is I think really hard work yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.829" end="00:43:50.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.220" end="00:43:52.700" style="s2">you know so I guess by now a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.839" end="00:43:55.190" style="s2">people are familiar with the the Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.700" end="00:43:57.500" style="s2">Peterson meme of clean up clean up your</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.190" end="00:44:00.470" style="s2">room and sort of this this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.500" end="00:44:02.660" style="s2">having starting small and and becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.470" end="00:44:05.359" style="s2">responsible for one&#39;s own sort of inner</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.660" end="00:44:06.589" style="s2">world and and local space and without</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.359" end="00:44:09.140" style="s2">getting overwhelmed by trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.589" end="00:44:13.160" style="s2">all the world&#39;s problems with some one</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.140" end="00:44:15.470" style="s2">utopian grand plan you know so I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.160" end="00:44:17.900" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.470" end="00:44:22.130" style="s2">elements and a sentiment to that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.900" end="00:44:24.109" style="s2">makes a lot of sense so trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.130" end="00:44:28.250" style="s2">the world has nearly killed me on</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.109" end="00:44:29.809" style="s2">several occasions and fortunately I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.250" end="00:44:33.589" style="s2">now come to a place with it</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.809" end="00:44:37.009" style="s2">where I&#39;d still like to fix the world if</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.589" end="00:44:40.099" style="s2">I&#39;m honest but I won&#39;t consider myself a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.009" end="00:44:42.940" style="s2">failure if I don&#39;t manage to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.099" end="00:44:45.859" style="s2">that for me it feels like a real</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.940" end="00:44:49.210" style="s2">position to be in and so for me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.859" end="00:44:52.789" style="s2">this kind of balance of not abdicating</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.210" end="00:44:56.930" style="s2">but also not overreaching and not</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.789" end="00:44:59.539" style="s2">projecting my own psychological fuck-ups</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.930" end="00:45:02.660" style="s2">onto external forces and going out and</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.539" end="00:45:04.400" style="s2">campaigning with that and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.660" end="00:45:07.190" style="s2">really what Jordan Peters is saying like</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.400" end="00:45:08.900" style="s2">you know don&#39;t project your wounds and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.190" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">vulnerabilities out there into the world</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.900" end="00:45:12.980" style="s2">and concentrate on that fix that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:15.349" style="s2">first once you got far enough with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.980" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">to not be a liability putting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.349" end="00:45:21.470" style="s2">out there crack on get on with it go do</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:24.109" style="s2">it so that&#39;s kind of my work-in-progress</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.470" end="00:45:28.369" style="s2">around it so I work with young people</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.109" end="00:45:30.200" style="s2">with a charity called mind and my job is</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.369" end="00:45:33.529" style="s2">in service design currently so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.200" end="00:45:34.970" style="s2">looking at how can we help young people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.529" end="00:45:36.289" style="s2">in schools and reimagine mental health</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.970" end="00:45:37.819" style="s2">support for young people in schools so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.289" end="00:45:38.540" style="s2">spent the last sort of six weeks running</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.819" end="00:45:41.750" style="s2">focused group</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.540" end="00:45:45.590" style="s2">of young people and if the young people</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.750" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t forced to be there then it will</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.590" end="00:45:49.820" style="s2">always be girls if they&#39;re cherry in</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:51.110" style="s2">life they&#39;re cherry pick then you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.820" end="00:45:52.280" style="s2">kind of get you can get boys in the moon</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.110" end="00:45:55.370" style="s2">as well but even when the boys are in</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.280" end="00:45:57.470" style="s2">the room getting them to actually use</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.370" end="00:45:59.390" style="s2">their voice and to articulate their</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.470" end="00:46:01.790" style="s2">inner experience is incredibly difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.390" end="00:46:03.110" style="s2">and draining this has been replicated it</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.790" end="00:46:05.330" style="s2">was every South London school that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.110" end="00:46:07.070" style="s2">been in it&#39;s the same thing if the boy</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.330" end="00:46:08.930" style="s2">is not speaking up you&#39;ve had some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.070" end="00:46:10.550" style="s2">these huge campaigns like time to change</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.930" end="00:46:12.500" style="s2">that&#39;s taken on mental health stigma for</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.550" end="00:46:14.780" style="s2">example from a seemingly unassailable</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.500" end="00:46:16.310" style="s2">position and beaten it down to a point</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.780" end="00:46:17.870" style="s2">where it&#39;s kind of okay to say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.310" end="00:46:22.610" style="s2">struggling now much more so than before</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.870" end="00:46:24.140" style="s2">and I&#39;m curious to know our funders our</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.610" end="00:46:25.730" style="s2">governments do you see it on the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.140" end="00:46:27.290" style="s2">that this stuff is actually going to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.730" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">looked at that perhaps it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.290" end="00:46:31.250" style="s2">good idea to start tackling this problem</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">a little bit further upstream rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.250" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">than waiting to the young people burn</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">the village down just to feel the warmth</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.980" end="00:46:45.590" style="s2">how long have we got it&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.710" end="00:46:47.420" style="s2">question and I think I could go in and</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.590" end="00:46:54.860" style="s2">pick apart lots of different bits of</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.420" end="00:46:57.740" style="s2">that and the thing for me the piece I</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.860" end="00:47:03.860" style="s2">think that we can do is that bit about</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.740" end="00:47:06.770" style="s2">imagining what the healthy journey from</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.860" end="00:47:10.130" style="s2">being a young boy to a mature adult man</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.770" end="00:47:12.740" style="s2">looks like and rather than focus on</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.130" end="00:47:14.570" style="s2">pathologizing the problems really focus</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.740" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">on what does the positive journey look</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.570" end="00:47:21.110" style="s2">like and can we lobby for those stages</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:25.640" style="s2">to be included within the curriculum in</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.110" end="00:47:29.300" style="s2">schools I would say how to get them into</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.640" end="00:47:31.310" style="s2">the room I wouldn&#39;t have gone to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.300" end="00:47:34.730" style="s2">mental health voluntary workshop when I</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.310" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">was a teenager I might have gone to one</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.730" end="00:47:42.080" style="s2">on ideas and philosophy you could do one</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">on like sports and values where you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.080" end="00:47:45.800" style="s2">some kind of game and then the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:47.330" style="s2">discussion afterwards or something like</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.800" end="00:47:51.380" style="s2">music and then some discussion</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.330" end="00:47:52.860" style="s2">afterwards so come at it sideways rather</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.380" end="00:47:55.860" style="s2">than straight on</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.860" end="00:47:58.680" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna fix you so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.860" end="00:48:00.450" style="s2">supposed to I think that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.680" end="00:48:02.850" style="s2">great idea I think it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.450" end="00:48:05.700" style="s2">to reach men just by saying this will</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.850" end="00:48:06.900" style="s2">make you more healthy or you&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.700" end="00:48:09.510" style="s2">in touch with your emotions it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.900" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">okay why it&#39;s like okay this will help</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.510" end="00:48:12.150" style="s2">you get into a state for making better</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:13.440" style="s2">music or this will help you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.150" end="00:48:15.810" style="s2">state for making better art or or</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.440" end="00:48:17.160" style="s2">something I mean something around that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.810" end="00:48:19.050" style="s2">mean we&#39;re having this conversation as</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.160" end="00:48:19.950" style="s2">well with with rebel wisdom we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.050" end="00:48:22.560" style="s2">thinking about doing sort of martial</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.950" end="00:48:24.600" style="s2">arts to kind of tap into come and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.560" end="00:48:26.190" style="s2">release your anger in a martial arts</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.600" end="00:48:29.700" style="s2">session and then do some sharing around</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.190" end="00:48:32.070" style="s2">it and reframe it within kind of there I</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.700" end="00:48:35.880" style="s2">think there has to be a function beyond</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.070" end="00:48:37.770" style="s2">just the the therapeutic benefit of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.880" end="00:48:38.970" style="s2">and I think no one&#39;s cracked it yet</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.770" end="00:48:40.260" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of talking about it as well</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.970" end="00:48:41.900" style="s2">and I think the other thing is</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.260" end="00:48:43.560" style="s2">mainstreaming this personal growth</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.900" end="00:48:45.960" style="s2">conversation it has to be made</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.560" end="00:48:48.270" style="s2">mainstream and it hasn&#39;t been yet and</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.960" end="00:48:50.190" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of something I think we&#39;re</p>
