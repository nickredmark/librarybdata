<p begin="00:00:10.830" end="00:00:16.949" style="s2">since the 1970s in the tradition of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">likes of Jean Piaget his major insight</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.949" end="00:00:21.740" style="s2">was to show how development went far</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">beyond adolescence and into adulthood</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.740" end="00:00:26.910" style="s2">his models lay out the major processes</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:30.000" style="s2">of development from impulsive self</p>

<p begin="00:00:41.399" end="00:00:45.780" style="s2">were quite popular with Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.489" end="00:00:49.649" style="s2">introducing the concept of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.780" end="00:00:53.059" style="s2">theory and you&#39;re you teach</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.649" end="00:00:54.989" style="s2">developmental theory at Harvard and</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.059" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">unknown is sort of one of the biggest</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.059" end="00:01:05.309" style="s2">how would you wires developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.250" end="00:01:10.290" style="s2">important in a way developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.309" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">is just helping us to better understand</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.290" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">our fullest possibilities so you know a</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">caterpillar it has a destiny to grow</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:32.479" style="s2">wings and fly the developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">is just part of a bigger mission to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.479" end="00:01:38.939" style="s2">encourage the greater realization of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">human potential so that fewer and fewer</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.939" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">of our brothers and sisters die as</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:45.540" style="s2">caterpillars and more of us become</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.320" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">butterflies could you briefly outline</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.540" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">your model and how it differs from other</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">models I mean people might be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.840" style="s2">with say Abraham Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:56.509" style="s2">needs where at the bottom we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.840" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">sustenance at the top we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.509" end="00:02:00.689" style="s2">self-actualization I guess that was the</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">most sort of that was probably the one</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.689" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">that made developmental thinking popular</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:09.420" style="s2">in the 70s and people might be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">with Ken Wilbur&#39;s model as well what are</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.420" end="00:02:14.010" style="s2">the stages in your model and does it map</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:16.200" style="s2">on to those at all</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:19.080" style="s2">well maybe in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.200" end="00:02:21.300" style="s2">my theory is often referred to as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.080" end="00:02:23.580" style="s2">constructive developmental theory which</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.300" end="00:02:26.280" style="s2">means that it kind of brings together</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.580" end="00:02:28.860" style="s2">two very powerful ideas the first is</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.280" end="00:02:31.230" style="s2">constructivism the notion that reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.860" end="00:02:33.660" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just sort of happen up to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.230" end="00:02:36.750" style="s2">preformed one of the things we do as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.660" end="00:02:40.250" style="s2">human beings is give shape to raw</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.750" end="00:02:43.560" style="s2">experience and make it into something</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.250" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">meaningful for us and that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.560" end="00:02:47.700" style="s2">constructivism runs through many many</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">different psychological and</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.700" end="00:02:53.670" style="s2">philosophical orientations then another</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.430" end="00:02:57.470" style="s2">very very big idea is the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.670" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">developmental ism that is that living</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.470" end="00:03:04.170" style="s2">organisms and systems including human</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:09.420" style="s2">beings don&#39;t just grow in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.170" end="00:03:11.520" style="s2">getting bigger and bigger we evolve</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.420" end="00:03:14.490" style="s2">become more complex I mean when a baby</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.520" end="00:03:16.830" style="s2">is born when you were born David your</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.490" end="00:03:20.459" style="s2">head was 1/3 the size of your body just</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.830" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">like every other infant but as we grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.459" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t become you know 6 foot</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:29.959" style="s2">and have a two-foot head all right so</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which we we grow</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.959" end="00:03:39.209" style="s2">through stages that kind of form and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:40.980" style="s2">reform now if you take the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.209" end="00:03:43.560" style="s2">constructivism the notion that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.980" end="00:03:45.090" style="s2">making meaning of things and the notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.560" end="00:03:47.580" style="s2">of developmental ism and put them</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.090" end="00:03:49.489" style="s2">together you begin to get this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.580" end="00:03:53.580" style="s2">the very way in which we construct</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.489" end="00:03:55.650" style="s2">reality itself transforms across</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.580" end="00:03:59.280" style="s2">different stages so there are in other</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.650" end="00:04:02.340" style="s2">words different logics that gradually</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.280" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">develop over time if you if you will or</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.340" end="00:04:06.180" style="s2">we call them psycho logics because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:11.489" style="s2">talking about kind of the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.180" end="00:04:13.650" style="s2">psychology and that and that growing in</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.489" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">our meaning-making or even in our wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.650" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">is not about just knowing more and more</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:22.820" style="s2">through a given logic but actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:25.240" style="s2">having the underlying logic itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.820" end="00:04:28.870" style="s2">become more and more common</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.240" end="00:04:32.440" style="s2">in a way to borrow a phrase from my</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.870" end="00:04:39.550" style="s2">friend ken wilber that transcends but</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.440" end="00:04:41.919" style="s2">includes the prior logic so 10 I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.550" end="00:04:44.889" style="s2">is one of the great synthetic thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.919" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">on the planet and he brings together a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.889" end="00:04:52.900" style="s2">whole lot of different wisdom traditions</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:57.370" style="s2">and in Western academia would be more</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.900" end="00:05:00.370" style="s2">lines of research and I think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.370" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">most useful of his heuristics is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.370" end="00:05:05.979" style="s2">kind of for box model that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">underlies the notion of taking a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.979" end="00:05:11.080" style="s2">integrated or holistic perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:15.340" style="s2">any phenomenon and those four boxes</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.080" end="00:05:16.870" style="s2">which I&#39;m sure many of those looking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.340" end="00:05:18.340" style="s2">this are familiar with but just in case</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.870" end="00:05:19.870" style="s2">they&#39;re not as kind of just think about</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.340" end="00:05:22.120" style="s2">the difference between the individual</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.870" end="00:05:23.680" style="s2">level and the collective level and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.120" end="00:05:26.560" style="s2">think about the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.680" end="00:05:30.070" style="s2">interior and the exterior and that gives</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.560" end="00:05:33.550" style="s2">you these four boxes now if you zoom in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.070" end="00:05:36.699" style="s2">on one of those quadrants thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.550" end="00:05:40.180" style="s2">the interior development of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.699" end="00:05:42.190" style="s2">individual that&#39;s the box in which you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.180" end="00:05:45.009" style="s2">know I spent the first part of my</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.190" end="00:05:47.590" style="s2">professional life working largely as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.009" end="00:05:50.770" style="s2">theorist to better understand the</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.590" end="00:05:53.530" style="s2">gradual evolutions of interior</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.770" end="00:05:55.900" style="s2">individual development standing</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.530" end="00:05:59.409" style="s2">initially on the shoulders of of Jean</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.900" end="00:06:02.349" style="s2">Piaget the Swiss psychologist who was</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.409" end="00:06:05.169" style="s2">the first to kind of elucidate stages of</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.349" end="00:06:09.639" style="s2">child development and in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.169" end="00:06:13.960" style="s2">ways the children organized the physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.639" end="00:06:16.990" style="s2">world and kind of their cognition and my</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.960" end="00:06:18.759" style="s2">work has been to widen the aperture from</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.990" end="00:06:23.770" style="s2">cognition to the ways in which we</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.759" end="00:06:26.650" style="s2">organize all the primary quadrants of</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.770" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">personality how we think yes but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.650" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">how we feel how we construct our social</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:37.820" style="s2">relations with others and how we</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:41.780" style="s2">construct our interior relationships too</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.820" end="00:06:44.330" style="s2">of ourselves and so my theory kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.780" end="00:06:47.980" style="s2">opened the aperture beyond just</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.330" end="00:06:52.610" style="s2">cognition and then extended the study</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.980" end="00:06:56.750" style="s2">beyond children and adolescence which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.610" end="00:06:58.370" style="s2">kind of where Piaget ended to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.750" end="00:07:00.740" style="s2">consider the question you know is there</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.370" end="00:07:02.440" style="s2">life after adolescence and can we</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.740" end="00:07:05.270" style="s2">actually continue to grow</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.440" end="00:07:08.420" style="s2">psychologically even when we&#39;ve reached</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.270" end="00:07:10.310" style="s2">our full height physically I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.420" end="00:07:13.220" style="s2">literally when I started graduate school</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.310" end="00:07:16.280" style="s2">at Harvard in the 1970s if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.220" end="00:07:18.230" style="s2">developmental psychologist it meant you</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.280" end="00:07:20.300" style="s2">studied infants children or adolescents</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.230" end="00:07:22.910" style="s2">end of story</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.300" end="00:07:26.440" style="s2">because that was the period the first 20</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.910" end="00:07:29.690" style="s2">years of life let&#39;s say when we believed</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.440" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">psychological development actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.690" end="00:07:34.970" style="s2">occurred we&#39;d yoked our notions of</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:36.620" style="s2">physical development to psychological</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.970" end="00:07:39.260" style="s2">development and just as most of us reach</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.620" end="00:07:42.320" style="s2">our full physical stature let&#39;s say in</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.260" end="00:07:44.990" style="s2">our 20s early 20s it was believed that</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.320" end="00:07:47.960" style="s2">that was kind of the end state for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.990" end="00:07:51.580" style="s2">development of the of the brain even and</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.960" end="00:07:54.140" style="s2">brain scientists were very adamant you</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.580" end="00:07:56.870" style="s2">know what are we talking about 40 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.140" end="00:07:59.930" style="s2">ago now maybe that there were no further</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.870" end="00:08:02.390" style="s2">qualitative transformations and in brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.930" end="00:08:06.950" style="s2">material after about the first 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.390" end="00:08:12.530" style="s2">of life and our research and my</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.950" end="00:08:14.900" style="s2">colleagues and I basically never felt</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.530" end="00:08:17.420" style="s2">that seemed very sensible I mean just by</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.900" end="00:08:19.460" style="s2">common sense you live among adults and</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.420" end="00:08:21.320" style="s2">you see that some people seem to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.460" end="00:08:23.690" style="s2">of making meaning and qualitative</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.320" end="00:08:26.240" style="s2">qualitatively perceiving the world and</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.690" end="00:08:28.880" style="s2">at a greater depth you know than others</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.240" end="00:08:32.930" style="s2">and so we began to kind of explore all</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.880" end="00:08:35.270" style="s2">that and and today you know and I have</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.930" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">many friends who are you know quote hard</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.270" end="00:08:40.280" style="s2">scientists neuroscientists and you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:43.729" style="s2">today they have recanted that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.280" end="00:08:46.640" style="s2">constricted dogma and all talk now about</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.729" end="00:08:49.430" style="s2">the phenomenal neuroplasticity of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.640" end="00:08:50.900" style="s2">brains kind of one of the few instances</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.430" end="00:08:53.840" style="s2">in which the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.900" end="00:08:56.360" style="s2">scientist psychologists were actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.840" end="00:08:59.330" style="s2">maybe a bit out ahead of the hard</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.360" end="00:09:00.590" style="s2">scientists that&#39;s Norman Doidge for</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.330" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">example the brain that changes itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.590" end="00:09:05.420" style="s2">and the idea of neuroplasticity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:07.160" style="s2">yeah thinking fast thinking slow Connor</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.420" end="00:09:08.960" style="s2">men I mean I think that all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.160" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">Neurosciences were canted the notion</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.960" end="00:09:14.270" style="s2">that you know the brain is basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:16.460" style="s2">done in terms of its development I mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.270" end="00:09:18.620" style="s2">even then of course people probably</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.460" end="00:09:21.140" style="s2">would grant this notion that some people</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.620" end="00:09:24.140" style="s2">seem to be wiser than others but they</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.140" end="00:09:26.150" style="s2">they attributed that largely to the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.140" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">that some people were getting more out</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.150" end="00:09:30.650" style="s2">of the same equipment than other people</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:33.410" style="s2">and that experience of course matters</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.650" end="00:09:38.030" style="s2">and so some people are wiser not because</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.410" end="00:09:42.470" style="s2">they&#39;re actually kind of making sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.030" end="00:09:44.630" style="s2">the world with an upgraded system but</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.470" end="00:09:46.910" style="s2">rather that they&#39;re just learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.630" end="00:09:49.670" style="s2">get more out of the same system and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.910" end="00:09:54.170" style="s2">think what what what we&#39;ve come to show</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.670" end="00:09:57.080" style="s2">is no the the system itself which we</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.170" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2">have long understood those through</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.080" end="00:10:02.960" style="s2">qualitative transformations in childhood</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:06.200" style="s2">and adolescence Contini has the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.960" end="00:10:09.380" style="s2">potential to continue transforming on</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.200" end="00:10:12.470" style="s2">into our 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.380" end="00:10:14.630" style="s2">Beyond and could you outline what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.470" end="00:10:16.820" style="s2">the basic distinctions are in the model</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.630" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">I&#39;m aware of some of the terms you talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.820" end="00:10:21.710" style="s2">about the socialized mind and the self</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">authoring mind for example could you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.710" end="00:10:26.630" style="s2">outline what those are and what those</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.360" end="00:10:28.250" style="s2">mean sure so I&#39;ll give you a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.630" end="00:10:31.510" style="s2">example since these things are often</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.250" end="00:10:34.400" style="s2">like pictures worth a thousand words I</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.510" end="00:10:38.960" style="s2">was talking with a social worker the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.400" end="00:10:40.490" style="s2">other day who works with adolescents who</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.960" end="00:10:42.590" style="s2">have come out of the court system and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.490" end="00:10:46.310" style="s2">who&#39;ve committed you know crimes and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.590" end="00:10:51.350" style="s2">on and she was talking about a young man</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.310" end="00:10:55.700" style="s2">you know maybe 16 17 years old who had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.350" end="00:10:57.770" style="s2">record of auto theft and she&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.700" end="00:10:59.450" style="s2">working you know with them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.770" end="00:11:01.370" style="s2">she told me about a session she had with</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.450" end="00:11:04.370" style="s2">him where he he came to her and said you</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.370" end="00:11:06.140" style="s2">know you&#39;d be proud of me because I do</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.370" end="00:11:08.330" style="s2">still I know I shouldn&#39;t but I still do</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.140" end="00:11:10.250" style="s2">hang out with a number of rough friends</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.330" end="00:11:14.570" style="s2">who could easily get me in trouble</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.250" end="00:11:16.060" style="s2">and you know just this weekend I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.570" end="00:11:18.950" style="s2">hanging out with them and they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.060" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">they wanted to wanted me to join them in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.950" end="00:11:26.410" style="s2">stealing a car and ordinarily you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:28.820" style="s2">might have just gone along with that and</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.410" end="00:11:31.820" style="s2">because of our work together you know I</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.820" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">didn&#39;t I&#39;m really glad to hear about</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.820" end="00:11:35.030" style="s2">that you know so tell me a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:38.840" style="s2">more he said well you know they wanted</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.030" end="00:11:40.280" style="s2">me to steal this car and I i I was going</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.840" end="00:11:42.050" style="s2">to and I stopped and I thought to myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.280" end="00:11:43.940" style="s2">if I steal this car there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.050" end="00:11:46.910" style="s2">chance we&#39;re gonna get caught if I get</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.940" end="00:11:49.520" style="s2">caught because I&#39;m on probation unlike</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.910" end="00:11:51.260" style="s2">these other friends you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.520" end="00:11:55.400" style="s2">gonna get let off I&#39;m gonna go back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.260" end="00:11:57.550" style="s2">jail and she said that she said and well</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.400" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">you know I&#39;m really I&#39;m really glad</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.550" end="00:12:02.510" style="s2">burned that you you know didn&#39;t steal</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:07.040" style="s2">the car but I have to be honest and say</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.510" end="00:12:11.870" style="s2">that I wished the reason you chosen not</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.040" end="00:12:14.540" style="s2">to steal the car was not just that if</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.870" end="00:12:16.490" style="s2">you did you might go to jail but because</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.540" end="00:12:17.960" style="s2">you gave some thought to kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.490" end="00:12:20.420" style="s2">that person would feel and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.960" end="00:12:23.030" style="s2">his car&#39;s not your car and then he would</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.420" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">naturally feel bad and she said he just</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.030" end="00:12:32.420" style="s2">looked right at me and he said yes but</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">I&#39;m not there yet and she she sat back</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.420" end="00:12:35.450" style="s2">and she thought you know that was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:38.030" style="s2">beautiful answer that she was and he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.450" end="00:12:40.670" style="s2">being absolutely truthful and that her</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.030" end="00:12:43.280" style="s2">hope for him was a little further ahead</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.670" end="00:12:44.810" style="s2">of kind of where he was and you know she</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.280" end="00:12:47.150" style="s2">was kind of telling a story on herself</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.810" end="00:12:49.339" style="s2">kind of saying how you know you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.150" end="00:12:53.120" style="s2">learn from your clients even from your</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.339" end="00:12:55.010" style="s2">16 year old clients now when he said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.120" end="00:12:58.400" style="s2">not quite there yet from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.010" end="00:12:59.870" style="s2">developmentalist point of view we would</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.400" end="00:13:02.320" style="s2">also feel like he was telling a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.870" end="00:13:04.370" style="s2">important truth what are you saying was</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.320" end="00:13:07.700" style="s2">just give me credit for the fact I</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.370" end="00:13:10.279" style="s2">didn&#39;t steal the car by but my</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.700" end="00:13:12.259" style="s2">underlying logic is still about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.279" end="00:13:13.730" style="s2">my best interest and the reason I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.259" end="00:13:15.439" style="s2">steal it was because I had at least</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.730" end="00:13:17.420" style="s2">enough foresight to consider that I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.439" end="00:13:20.300" style="s2">could get caught I could get sent to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.420" end="00:13:21.980" style="s2">jail that is itself a given stage of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.300" end="00:13:25.189" style="s2">development it is the stage that comes</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.980" end="00:13:28.910" style="s2">before the socialized mind which she was</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.189" end="00:13:32.509" style="s2">hoping for was a qualitatively different</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.910" end="00:13:34.699" style="s2">stage where people live not only to</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.509" end="00:13:37.610" style="s2">pursue their own interests and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.699" end="00:13:40.309" style="s2">look at others as sort of opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.610" end="00:13:42.740" style="s2">to get their own needs met or obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.309" end="00:13:46.550" style="s2">to getting their needs met but where you</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.740" end="00:13:49.819" style="s2">actually begin to internalize something</p>

<p begin="00:13:59.170" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">eventually there&#39;s the possibility that</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.990" end="00:37:09.790" style="s2">happening is a given developmental</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.210" end="00:37:11.230" style="s2">position is sort of cannibalizing or</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.790" end="00:37:13.150" style="s2">taking over the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.230" end="00:37:13.600" style="s2">perspective you know if you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.150" end="00:37:15.700" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.600" end="00:37:17.020" style="s2">like achievement-oriented things show me</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.700" end="00:37:19.210" style="s2">a ladder and I&#39;m gonna climb to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.020" end="00:37:23.080" style="s2">highest rung as quickly as I possibly</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.210" end="00:37:25.120" style="s2">can then you know any kind of model you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.080" end="00:37:27.310" style="s2">know is quickly gonna turn into a new</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.120" end="00:37:29.110" style="s2">commodity instead of I want to be rich I</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.310" end="00:37:30.790" style="s2">want to be famous no I want to be at a</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.110" end="00:37:33.310" style="s2">high stage of development okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.790" end="00:37:38.440" style="s2">basically the same kind of thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.310" end="00:37:40.900" style="s2">know I talked to you know Zen masters</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.440" end="00:37:43.290" style="s2">and the Roshi&#39;s and you know people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.900" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">have spent their lives and you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.290" end="00:37:48.010" style="s2">monasteries you know and then they run</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:50.500" style="s2">into the same thing and I get Westerners</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.010" end="00:37:53.590" style="s2">who they want to be enlightened or even</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.500" end="00:37:55.720" style="s2">you know it becomes a new commodity how</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.590" end="00:37:57.700" style="s2">fast will it take and how much will it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.720" end="00:37:58.270" style="s2">cost or okay I don&#39;t even need to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.700" end="00:38:01.600" style="s2">enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.270" end="00:38:03.850" style="s2">I just want to practice these wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.600" end="00:38:05.800" style="s2">traditions so that I have less stress</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.850" end="00:38:07.750" style="s2">and I&#39;m a more effective executive and</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">they have to deal with the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.750" end="00:38:13.150" style="s2">like you&#39;re turning what I&#39;m offering</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">you into a means to some other end which</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.150" end="00:38:20.410" style="s2">actually does violence to you know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:22.570" style="s2">the whole framework is about we&#39;re we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.410" end="00:38:28.140" style="s2">started studying development because of</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.570" end="00:38:31.930" style="s2">the extraordinary joy and Wonder of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.140" end="00:38:33.580" style="s2">engaging the miracle of being alive and</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.930" end="00:38:35.770" style="s2">the difference between being a human</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.580" end="00:38:38.580" style="s2">being and the chair that you&#39;re sitting</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.770" end="00:38:40.660" style="s2">on is that you have the potential</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.580" end="00:38:43.030" style="s2">whether you want to call it you know the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.660" end="00:38:45.370" style="s2">underlying spirit like Hegel did that</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.030" end="00:38:47.340" style="s2">the Spirit is never at rest it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.370" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">working to give itself a new form that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.340" end="00:38:53.260" style="s2">you have this this spirit of you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:56.530" style="s2">within you and and I do too and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.260" end="00:38:58.570" style="s2">collectively we do that gives us the</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.530" end="00:39:03.430" style="s2">possibility like the caterpillar and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.570" end="00:39:05.980" style="s2">butterfly to actually transform and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.430" end="00:39:09.310" style="s2">whole intention of developmental theory</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.980" end="00:39:11.380" style="s2">was not to create a new ladder that one</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.310" end="00:39:13.360" style="s2">wants to climb to the top of as quickly</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.380" end="00:39:16.630" style="s2">as they can in turn the development into</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.360" end="00:39:18.550" style="s2">his joyless a ride as the the ride of</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.630" end="00:39:22.540" style="s2">trying to acquire the whoever as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.550" end="00:39:26.690" style="s2">most things wins the whole idea was to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.540" end="00:39:32.180" style="s2">actually consider the reality</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.690" end="00:39:34.700" style="s2">that we don&#39;t all of us come to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.180" end="00:39:37.910" style="s2">experience the fullest possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.700" end="00:39:41.000" style="s2">being alive if we&#39;re dying as</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.910" end="00:39:44.660" style="s2">caterpillars there&#39;s a whole dimension</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.000" end="00:39:47.900" style="s2">of life experience that is possible for</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.660" end="00:39:51.590" style="s2">us that we&#39;re not having the chance to</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.900" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">realize and that turns us then I mean to</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.590" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">me one of the greatest glories of my</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:39:57.980" style="s2">mission in life one of my greatest</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:40:00.530" style="s2">satisfaction is to invite people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.980" end="00:40:02.870" style="s2">have leadership responsibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.530" end="00:40:04.850" style="s2">opportunities whether within the small</p>

<p begin="00:40:36.350" end="00:40:41.210" style="s2">kind of the highest use of developmental</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.510" end="00:40:43.970" style="s2">fear it helped me better understand you</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.210" end="00:40:45.500" style="s2">where you are right now but not assume</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.500" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">and for me to think about what are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.840" end="00:40:52.280" style="s2">moves I can make that could make an</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:54.710" style="s2">environment one that will make it more</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.280" end="00:40:58.430" style="s2">likely you have the opportunity to</p>

<p begin="00:40:58.430" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">to me is very inspiring when we start</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.220" end="00:41:07.550" style="s2">turning it into some kind of a grading</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:09.380" style="s2">system and putting people in boxes you</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.550" end="00:41:10.940" style="s2">know we&#39;ve turned it into something else</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.380" end="00:41:13.460" style="s2">but this is I mean one of the humility</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.940" end="00:41:15.650" style="s2">is I&#39;m in my 70s now I&#39;ve been doing</p>

<p begin="00:41:37.770" end="00:41:41.460" style="s2">going to be you just have to hope that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.480" end="00:41:43.850" style="s2">it&#39;s much more often used for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.460" end="00:41:47.220" style="s2">inspiring purposes that you intended and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.850" end="00:41:50.850" style="s2">you mentioned jean piaget yes at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.220" end="00:41:52.380" style="s2">beginning he he&#39;s become kind of quite</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.850" end="00:41:54.810" style="s2">well-known through Jordan Peterson</p>

<p begin="00:41:57.000" end="00:41:59.940" style="s2">make of have you been following the</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.940" end="00:42:05.820" style="s2">make of no to teach me well one thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.530" end="00:42:08.430" style="s2">that he says is in particular what</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.820" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">Piaget was that PJ&#39;s ultimate aim he</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.430" end="00:42:11.970" style="s2">talked about he looked at kind of how</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:14.370" style="s2">children develop and the development of</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.970" end="00:42:17.840" style="s2">morality among children but his ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.370" end="00:42:20.520" style="s2">aim was about trying to tie together</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.840" end="00:42:22.220" style="s2">science and religion and find an</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.520" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">explanation for an emergent</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.220" end="00:42:27.300" style="s2">understanding of morality and tie</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:30.900" style="s2">together the the worlds of science and</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.300" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">religion do you resonate with that as an</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.900" end="00:42:35.510" style="s2">explanation for what Piaget was doing</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:37.800" style="s2">and how does that relate to your work</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.510" end="00:42:39.090" style="s2">well first of all it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.800" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">something interesting I should try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.090" end="00:42:45.390" style="s2">learn more about and I&#39;m not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:47.700" style="s2">sure that the most fruitful way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.390" end="00:42:51.560" style="s2">exploring this is just what psays</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.700" end="00:42:55.230" style="s2">intentions were but the Piaget was a</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.560" end="00:42:59.630" style="s2">twelve-year-old prodigy who you know at</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.230" end="00:43:02.720" style="s2">the age of 12 published something in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.630" end="00:43:06.330" style="s2">scientific journal that had to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:09.270" style="s2">his fascination of molluscs and the ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.330" end="00:43:10.980" style="s2">in which they evolved and he started</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.270" end="00:43:12.840" style="s2">getting letters from scholars who</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.980" end="00:43:14.580" style="s2">thought he was an adult who wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.840" end="00:43:16.500" style="s2">visit him because they were gonna be in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.580" end="00:43:18.780" style="s2">his a village or something and he had to</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.500" end="00:43:20.250" style="s2">figure out ways to not meet with them so</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.780" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t discover that he was 12</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.250" end="00:43:23.370" style="s2">years old</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">I guarantee you at 12 years old piya had</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.370" end="00:43:29.310" style="s2">no notions about bringing science and</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:33.380" style="s2">religion together the initial passion</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.310" end="00:43:37.350" style="s2">and curiosity was with the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.380" end="00:43:40.470" style="s2">living organisms transform and that went</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.350" end="00:43:42.900" style="s2">from mollusks to children and basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.470" end="00:43:46.230" style="s2">spend a lot of time asking children</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.900" end="00:43:47.269" style="s2">about their conceptions of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.230" end="00:43:49.849" style="s2">world and coming</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.269" end="00:43:52.759" style="s2">see that these enduring you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.849" end="00:43:54.829" style="s2">features around space-time causality and</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.759" end="00:43:56.869" style="s2">objects in the world is not something</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.829" end="00:44:00.049" style="s2">that&#39;s just given that you know</p>

<p begin="00:47:34.170" end="00:47:39.210" style="s2">willing to say something which is to go</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.410" end="00:47:41.850" style="s2">back to your earlier question kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.210" end="00:47:43.620" style="s2">the fundament of kind of the religious</p>

<p begin="00:48:17.710" end="00:48:21.999" style="s2">what is it that curates these</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.180" end="00:48:24.279" style="s2">experiences that I need to learn I need</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.999" end="00:48:26.499" style="s2">to grow so you need forms of challenge</p>

<p begin="00:49:23.799" end="00:49:28.719" style="s2">quick glimpse of this here before we</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.479" end="00:49:30.670" style="s2">conclude because that it&#39;s important for</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.719" end="00:49:34.239" style="s2">people to recognize that we are the only</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.670" end="00:49:37.059" style="s2">species on the planet living as long as</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.239" end="00:49:41.789" style="s2">we are beyond the years of fertility and</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.160" end="00:49:51.039" style="s2">and then they perish whereas we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:49:51.039" end="00:49:55.660" style="s2">years of fertility and this is something</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.660" end="00:50:00.640" style="s2">do we are today living you know most</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.869" end="00:50:03.369" style="s2">people died through most of human</p>

<p begin="00:50:11.140" end="00:50:15.849" style="s2">glib answer is advances in medical</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.479" end="00:50:23.289" style="s2">truncate our lives and so that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.829" end="00:50:24.250" style="s2">live longer but that&#39;s a kind of a thin</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.289" end="00:50:27.070" style="s2">technical</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.250" end="00:50:28.750" style="s2">answer to a much bigger question which</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.070" end="00:50:32.590" style="s2">is not what are the means by which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.750" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">happening but why is it happening and in</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.590" end="00:50:37.810" style="s2">the Western world where we have all this</p>

<p begin="00:50:37.810" end="00:50:42.250" style="s2">feel satisfied by an answer that says</p>
