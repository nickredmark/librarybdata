<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">welcome back to the dark horse podcast</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.719" end="00:00:14.799" style="s2">34th</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:15.759" style="s2">live stream q a we are ready to go you</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.799" end="00:00:18.800" style="s2">have filed</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.759" end="00:00:21.199" style="s2">many a cue yes you have all right so</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.800" end="00:00:23.600" style="s2">we will start by picking up wow i just</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.199" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">moved the entire operation</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.600" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">um i did not even know that was possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:33.120" style="s2">um we&#39;re gonna start by reading a couple</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">of questions from</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.120" end="00:00:39.200" style="s2">number 33 that we didn&#39;t get to and that</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:40.000" style="s2">seemed particularly worthy of going back</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.000" end="00:00:44.320" style="s2">question one is there truth to the loss</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.320" style="s2">of one sense strengthening others</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.320" end="00:00:48.399" style="s2">i am a near-sighted deaf person did i</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.320" end="00:00:51.039" style="s2">get cheated or have i used my eyes too</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.399" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">much and worn them out</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.039" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">this is actually from our friend holly</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:58.640" style="s2">there is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:01:00.800" style="s2">truth in effect the mechanism may not be</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.640" end="00:01:02.719" style="s2">what one imagines it would be but</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.800" end="00:01:04.479" style="s2">let&#39;s say for example that you are not</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">using your</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.479" end="00:01:07.920" style="s2">visual processing power for vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:11.119" style="s2">because you&#39;re not getting inputs</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.920" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">that allows it to be used by other</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.119" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">senses and so and there are in fact some</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">extraordinary cases of this in um</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">people who are musical savants</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:25.280" style="s2">who are typically blind so anyway we</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.920" end="00:01:27.600" style="s2">should talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.280" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">at greater length another time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.600" end="00:01:32.079" style="s2">very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:32.799" style="s2">and uh for instance we know of people um</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.079" end="00:01:35.360" style="s2">who can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.799" end="00:01:37.439" style="s2">actually who appear to be echolocating</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.360" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">right who are who are blind</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.439" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">and who echolocate and the echolocation</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.479" end="00:01:43.360" style="s2">the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">actual processing of the sound in some</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.360" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">of these cases where it&#39;s been looked at</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s never not true when</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">it&#39;s been looked at but</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.200" style="s2">in some cases where it&#39;s been looked at</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:51.680" style="s2">the sound processing is actually taking</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.200" end="00:01:53.840" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.680" end="00:01:55.200" style="s2">in the normally optical processing part</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.840" end="00:01:55.759" style="s2">of the brain oh i actually didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.200" end="00:01:58.079" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.759" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">that matches um the hypothesis i have</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">advanced</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">for the savants was that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">effectively had a graphics card that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.680" style="s2">wasn&#39;t occupied with graphics</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">that could be utilized for the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.680" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">closest input which was</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">music</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">questions from last time is just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:25.599" style="s2">comment that i thought warranted</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.840" style="s2">mentioning here uh someone has sent us a</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.599" end="00:02:29.440" style="s2">super chat uh donation for the cat</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.840" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">and the cat appreciates that very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.440" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">thank you which cat</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">uh probably the one who made a cameo</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.720" style="s2">last time was fairfax</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">walked in front of yes he may show up</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.720" end="00:02:40.239" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">uh any advice on winning your liberal</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.239" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">friends back</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.959" style="s2">all my friends were liberal um if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:47.680" style="s2">lost them</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.959" end="00:02:48.800" style="s2">because they couldn&#39;t stand reason i</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.680" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.800" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">um upgrade better friends is what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">need well i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">i just wonder if we can do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">better and i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">the answer but um</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">probably some of them could be reasoned</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:08.159" style="s2">with that you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:09.440" style="s2">friends may depart in a group and uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.159" end="00:03:12.239" style="s2">some may be wondering</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.440" end="00:03:14.319" style="s2">if there is there is anything to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.239" end="00:03:18.239" style="s2">critique that this person presumably was</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.319" end="00:03:20.640" style="s2">offering up so</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.239" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">i mean look if they come back and they</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.640" end="00:03:23.840" style="s2">say whoa i blew it</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.599" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing if they don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.840" end="00:03:27.760" style="s2">really want to invest your time</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.599" end="00:03:29.040" style="s2">recovering people who were so blind that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.760" end="00:03:30.799" style="s2">even though they knew you</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.040" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">and they knew what you were made of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.799" end="00:03:34.720" style="s2">they assumed that because</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.480" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">your perspective didn&#39;t match theirs</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.720" end="00:03:40.319" style="s2">that uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">you were inherently wrong or bad i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.319" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">some level who needs it um you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:47.840" style="s2">come join the free thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">okay i&#39;d like to come back here but</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:53.760" style="s2">maybe not now okay um it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">the first question</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.760" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">uh for this live stream is from the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:03:58.159" style="s2">person as that question was which i</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:03:59.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t notice until i just put them</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.159" end="00:04:04.239" style="s2">right next to each other</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.920" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">and he&#39;s asking he i assume um</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:07.519" style="s2">it&#39;s asking us because he gave a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">money um</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.519" end="00:04:13.599" style="s2">to read a question that he put into</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.959" style="s2">the comments somewhere was forwarded to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.599" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">us by our moderator</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.959" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">um and i&#39;m not going to read the whole</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">thing because this would take several</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">minutes um so i&#39;m going to try to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.960" style="s2">summarize</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:25.759" style="s2">um so this is basically an analogy he</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.960" end="00:04:27.120" style="s2">yeah he is proposing an analogy to what</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.759" end="00:04:30.240" style="s2">we proposed in the last</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.120" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">in 33 regard to the new the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.240" end="00:04:33.199" style="s2">what he calls in the new neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:34.080" style="s2">movement which is not how i would</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.199" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">characterize it</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.080" end="00:04:38.000" style="s2">as a ponzi scheme he says i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">considering a more viscous comparison</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.000" end="00:04:40.880" style="s2">would be the degree to which modern</p>

<p begin="00:04:45.199" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">if you&#39;re wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.560" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">or the scientists say it will get worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">so fall in line if you&#39;re wrong everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">will suffer why are you trying to kill</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:56.800" style="s2">grandma</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">he argues they are saying not only are</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.800" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">you wrong for questioning anything we</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:02.800" style="s2">don&#39;t like but you&#39;re wrong as a person</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:05.120" style="s2">worthy of degradation by virtue of who</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.800" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">you are and or what you represent</p>

<p begin="00:05:12.639" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.759" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">i can understand burning witches they</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.080" style="s2">didn&#39;t know darwin or foucault but</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">what&#39;s grotesque about the current</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.080" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">standards is the fortitude behind we</p>

<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:26.720" style="s2">your demographic predicaments and we</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">fit together</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">i&#39;m and i skipped some but i read the</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">sure how it fits</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.560" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">so there&#39;s you know there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.880" end="00:05:46.000" style="s2">pascal&#39;s wager</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">stuff in there you want to spell that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.000" end="00:05:50.960" style="s2">out yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:54.479" style="s2">that effectively uh you&#39;d be a fool</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.960" end="00:05:56.560" style="s2">to face your death as an atheist because</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.479" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">what do you get for being an atheist and</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.560" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">um throw your head in</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.840" style="s2">right yeah um so anyway i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:03.199" style="s2">subscribe to it at that level though i</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.840" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">think the logic is sound</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.199" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">um i think there&#39;s something to be said</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:13.919" style="s2">um the courage of your convictions</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:16.560" style="s2">in in that case but um the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.919" end="00:06:17.199" style="s2">the real question is how do you separate</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.199" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">what is my</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:24.560" style="s2">bayesian analysis of what is likely to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:27.759" style="s2">be true and then how do i translate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.560" end="00:06:29.120" style="s2">into policy and how do i translate that</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.759" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">into policy</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.120" end="00:06:33.600" style="s2">involves a cost-benefit calculation that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:34.960" style="s2">is not strictly speaking deducible from</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.600" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.960" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">so right um should you wear a mask if</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">a five percent chance of it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:44.720" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">but downstream of you is likely to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.720" end="00:06:48.000" style="s2">several people who will die if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">wear it then</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.000" end="00:06:52.639" style="s2">yeah the point is you may think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">useful but the chances that you save</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.639" end="00:06:56.319" style="s2">somebody&#39;s life are high enough and life</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">is valuable enough that you would adjust</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.319" end="00:07:00.400" style="s2">the calculation</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:01.759" style="s2">likewise in the case of uh climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.400" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">change for example</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.759" end="00:07:07.120" style="s2">a lot of us um have become persuaded</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">that to confront climate change is</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.120" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">actually to create</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:14.240" style="s2">um positive economic growth</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">that in fact we are retarding growth by</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:17.520" style="s2">obligating ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">not to change the mechanism by which we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.520" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">fuel things and that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">we&#39;ve been sold a false bill of goods</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:23.919" style="s2">that the thing that would happen if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">were to confront</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.919" end="00:07:27.039" style="s2">climate change properly is austerity</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.400" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.039" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">prosperity and so in that case you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">should do it because um modernizing what</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">makes sense and it&#39;s rent seekers who</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">would prevent us from doing it oh man</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:39.120" style="s2">can we just</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:40.720" style="s2">this this is what needs to be shared</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.120" end="00:07:43.840" style="s2">from the rooftops right</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.720" end="00:07:45.440" style="s2">right right there rent seekers who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.840" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">want us to address climate change</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.440" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">because they are the ones who are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">winning with the current paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.280" style="s2">and we can see more prosperity and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">a more intact planet than the one we are</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.280" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">hurtling towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">uh if we address what&#39;s going on yeah um</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.600" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">there are so many stories that need to</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.839" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">be told and</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:16.160" style="s2">certainly there are many that neither we</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">nor any of the people sort of in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.160" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">circle will end up</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">talking about because there are just too</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">many and especially because this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:26.080" style="s2">something that eric has particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">knowledge about and um has voiced</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.080" end="00:09:32.320" style="s2">uh his expertise on so many times i</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">i feel like he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s done</p>

<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">but i&#39;m not saying that you know we</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:38.160" style="s2">won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:39.680" style="s2">we won&#39;t talk about it but it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.160" end="00:09:43.120" style="s2">something that i&#39;m focused on</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.680" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s what they were doing is</p>

<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:47.200" style="s2">well and the question though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.920" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">implied here is</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.200" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">why right what is it why is the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:53.839" style="s2">protecting</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.040" style="s2">this and and so you know it potentially</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.839" end="00:09:57.519" style="s2">is related to</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.040" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">the bigger the the what what goliath is</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.519" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">this yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">what what&#39;s what is the compromise doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:05.279" style="s2">in this story</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">and how would the world be different if</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.279" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">it weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s obviously a hugely important</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">question so</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.760" end="00:10:15.600" style="s2">hopefully we will find out yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:17.360" style="s2">when do we get real news on unity 2020</p>

<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:40.720" style="s2">be the first step</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.519" end="00:10:43.600" style="s2">in a larger effort that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.720" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">literally less than 24 hours from being</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.600" end="00:10:46.880" style="s2">unveiled if everything is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">continues on the current trajectory so</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:47.200" style="s2">given that given that we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">we have we have tended</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.200" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">to be more um pointed</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">and frequent in our criticism of what</p>

<p begin="00:12:00.399" end="00:12:03.440" style="s2">never have been and and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.560" end="00:12:06.639" style="s2">don&#39;t like trump</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.440" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">um but you know because we have</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.639" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">we have critiqued more often what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">democrats are doing i suspect that that</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">is the party in question here yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:14.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually a very difficult puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:17.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.720" end="00:12:20.720" style="s2">um i think people correctly intuit</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.839" end="00:12:22.079" style="s2">that if that structure is as compromised</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.720" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">as many of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.079" end="00:12:27.200" style="s2">claim to know that it is then</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:29.040" style="s2">they feel they have been left completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.200" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">adrift which they have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.040" end="00:12:35.040" style="s2">and so how do you convince somebody to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">consider the possibility that the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.040" end="00:12:40.880" style="s2">structure that is the hedge against</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">chaos is in fact functioning in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.880" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">predatory fashion that is going to put</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">into chaos so i guess my point is</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s the evidence i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">think the evidence is all that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">complex i mean the fact is the democrats</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:57.600" style="s2">marshall an absolutely appalling</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">candidate in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.600" end="00:13:00.639" style="s2">despite the fact that there was a very</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:04.480" style="s2">popular candidate</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.639" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">um on the rise they sabotaged sanders</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.480" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">why would they do that they would</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">sabotage sanders because sanders was</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">actually interested in change</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:12.959" style="s2">now i don&#39;t think the change that</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.560" style="s2">sanders was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.959" end="00:13:16.399" style="s2">is the kind of change we should be</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.560" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">pursuing but nonetheless there was an</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.399" end="00:13:19.839" style="s2">awful lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">behind sanders and for good reason he</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.839" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">well and i mean so that was 2016.</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">they by my estimation they&#39;ve promoted</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">what may be</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">somehow an even worse candidate in 2020</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">from a much deeper slate</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">from like there was i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">excusing anything that happened in 2016</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">but there was this heir apparent there</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:43.040" style="s2">was this</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">you know we we actually we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.040" end="00:13:46.160" style="s2">um powerful families in this country and</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:46.480" style="s2">we&#39;re going to let the clintons continue</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.160" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.480" end="00:13:50.079" style="s2">to reign sort of sort of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">that&#39;s not an excuse at all but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.079" end="00:13:53.839" style="s2">explains a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">of what they might have been doing and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.839" end="00:13:58.079" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not even as explicable um in this</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.079" end="00:14:01.519" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:03.120" style="s2">to choose someone with um apparently</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.519" end="00:14:06.240" style="s2">failing competencies</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">um when there was actually an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.240" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">rich and diverse in terms of ideology</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">and experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.079" style="s2">slate of canada&#39;s so i agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:15.760" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.079" end="00:14:17.279" style="s2">that&#39;s where i was headed next is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.760" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">they&#39;ve done this to us two elections in</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.279" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">a row</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">is amazing but here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">people their their minds will not allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">them to make this switch but it looks to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:27.680" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">like it&#39;s quite straightforward they</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.680" end="00:14:31.680" style="s2">prefer</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.320" style="s2">to lose to trump than to risk actual</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.680" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.320" end="00:14:35.760" style="s2">this is because this is an influence</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">pedaling racket</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.760" end="00:14:40.240" style="s2">an influence peddling racket cannot give</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:43.040" style="s2">up its</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.240" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">saleable good which is influence if it</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.040" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">decides to embrace a candidate</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">that actually would stand in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">corruption then it loses</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:53.839" style="s2">its uh its profitability so by</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">putting feeble candidates up against</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.839" end="00:14:57.920" style="s2">trump who it claims is the great evil</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">right if it really believed he was the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.920" end="00:15:02.560" style="s2">great evil and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">who is most likely to beat him you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.560" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">andrew yang would lose to trump i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">think andrew yang would lose to trump i</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:10.959" style="s2">think he would walk all over</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:11.839" style="s2">right the authenticity is there the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.959" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.839" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">the decency right i i&#39;ve seen the polls</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">i&#39;m still not writing off trump i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:19.920" style="s2">think biden&#39;s going to be oh and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:22.480" style="s2">they&#39;re shifting</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.920" end="00:15:23.760" style="s2">actually as of as of this week well it</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.480" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.760" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">at all and i must say in the few minutes</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:30.079" style="s2">between our</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">initial hour and this i saw an extremely</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.079" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">totally predictable clip in which um</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">biden walks on stage and um</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">says i&#39;m so glad to be at somewhere that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">he isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">and then realizes he&#39;s made an error and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:47.920" style="s2">dismisses it as a joke which it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well if you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.920" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">through the first minute of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:54.160" style="s2">you know i guess i am no fan of biden as</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:56.880" style="s2">you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.160" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">i&#39;m more willing to excuse uh slips of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.880" end="00:15:59.440" style="s2">oh god what</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s tuesday it must be birmingham</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.440" end="00:16:03.120" style="s2">sort of sort of things but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:04.959" style="s2">you know once he actually has to start</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.120" end="00:16:06.560" style="s2">engaging real things in real time like</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">real issues as opposed to do i remember</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.560" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">where i&#39;m standing</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">oh i believe we&#39;re gonna see this all</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.199" style="s2">over the place you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:14.079" style="s2">any normal candidate could have made</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.199" end="00:16:15.759" style="s2">such a slip</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.079" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">that&#39;s not what this appeared to be this</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.759" end="00:16:20.399" style="s2">appeared to be a complete</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:22.880" style="s2">lack of awareness and then a you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.399" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">kind of a go-to move to dismiss it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.880" end="00:16:26.720" style="s2">and the thing is it&#39;s so regular that we</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:29.120" style="s2">see evidence</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.720" end="00:16:30.320" style="s2">of his failing mental capacities does</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:49.039" style="s2">i believe and there is some clinical</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">evidence to support the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.039" end="00:18:52.960" style="s2">the vast majority of people who are on</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:54.720" style="s2">these things are simply experiencing a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.960" end="00:18:57.679" style="s2">flattening of affect</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.720" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">and that prevents them from actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.679" end="00:19:00.559" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.160" style="s2">how to control their own emotions</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.559" end="00:19:04.400" style="s2">organize their own mood</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">and that flattening of affect is what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.400" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">you just said</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:09.039" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the ideas that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:11.840" style="s2">hate most that you&#39;re scared of most</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.039" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">actually and we&#39;re seeing society-wide</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.840" end="00:19:14.000" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">and the fact is you probably know it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.000" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">from your own life that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.600" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">um you know the troughs give the the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:21.280" style="s2">peaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">meaning and so i think the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.280" end="00:19:24.880" style="s2">meaning is really important</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.480" style="s2">if you if you gave me the ability just</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.880" end="00:19:30.160" style="s2">personally to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.480" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">erase um negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.160" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">sensation there&#39;s no way i&#39;d push that</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:35.919" style="s2">button</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">no way that would be like death right</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.919" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">it&#39;s the equivalent it just removes</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">and you know the reverse calibration it</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:43.919" style="s2">removes set point</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">and you know what what it does is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.919" end="00:19:48.880" style="s2">moves all of your expectations just</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">up and now you&#39;ve got a new frame but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.880" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to make</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">there can be no utopia i mean it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">same error right it is exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:57.679" style="s2">error we&#39;re seeking utopia we&#39;re seeking</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:20:00.960" style="s2">into suffering</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.679" end="00:20:03.039" style="s2">these things won&#39;t happen yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.960" end="00:20:05.360" style="s2">another way to come at it is if you just</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.039" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">simply recognize that these things exist</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.360" end="00:20:08.240" style="s2">in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">as a proxy to point you away from things</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.240" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">that hurt you and point you toward</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">things that are good</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:15.200" style="s2">then do you really want to eliminate the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">map program that allows you to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.200" end="00:20:18.159" style="s2">because that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.760" style="s2">right it&#39;s a map program that steers you</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.159" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">towards goodness and away from badness</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.760" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.440" style="s2">if you think about it that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">reason that you succeed in anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.440" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">yeah what do you think about calling for</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">a public debate between d&#39;angelo and</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.120" style="s2">kendy versus any two from the black</p>

<p begin="00:20:33.120" end="00:20:37.200" style="s2">for instance i&#39;d love to see hashtag</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.960" end="00:20:40.000" style="s2">coleman versus candy trending</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.200" end="00:20:41.440" style="s2">i love this idea um deangelo and candy</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.000" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t agree no they wouldn&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.440" end="00:20:44.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s not to say that we couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">find somebody on that side who would</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.480" end="00:20:48.640" style="s2">which would be great</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:17.600" style="s2">anti-semitism with anti-zionism is a</p>

<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:58.080" style="s2">there is a lot of that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.679" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">the problem is it&#39;s muddled but you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.080" end="00:22:02.400" style="s2">there&#39;s obviously critique to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:03.919" style="s2">delivered of israeli policy on the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.400" end="00:22:05.840" style="s2">hand as eric points out</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.919" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">very clearly you have to do it in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.840" end="00:22:09.280" style="s2">context of the problem you know as with</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">portland you have to do it in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.280" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">context of the problem that is being</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.960" style="s2">addressed which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">a nation surrounded by uh hostile</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">and so um anyway yes we would</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">i think all of us the decent folk would</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:27.600" style="s2">desire a humane policy that allows</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">israel to get along with its neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.600" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">that the ability to have such a policy</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:36.960" style="s2">is predicated on neighbors willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:38.720" style="s2">to play ball so anyway yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.960" end="00:22:40.960" style="s2">there&#39;s dog whistle all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.720" end="00:22:44.240" style="s2">and the distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.960" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">uh resistance to what&#39;s called zionism</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.240" end="00:22:49.440" style="s2">versus anti-semitism is an important</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">apparently</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.720" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">michael eric dyson not tyson yeah dyson</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.320" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2">yes oh zach says like the vacuum</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.799" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">um i am pessimistic that critical race</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:08.240" style="s2">theory and postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.840" style="s2">ideas can&#39;t be beat i think by which</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.240" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">this person means i&#39;m worried that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.840" end="00:23:13.840" style="s2">can&#39;t be beat because it appeals to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">human desire to be virtuous and moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.840" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">are you hopeful these ideas can be beat</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:20.159" style="s2">if so what are some signs of hope</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:21.280" style="s2">thanks for your hard work they can be</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.159" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">beat</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.280" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">but you have to you know it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">context and the way they are winning</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">is not because the arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">difficult to beat but because</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:33.840" style="s2">the um sustenance is</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:35.120" style="s2">easy to deny to people so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.840" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">that you can frighten people about</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.120" end="00:23:40.240" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen to them</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:41.679" style="s2">and then offer them a hand they will</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.240" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">tend to take it and</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.679" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">so they&#39;re easily manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.720" style="s2">if we are to successfully counter this</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">it requires</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.720" end="00:23:53.360" style="s2">that we provide people someplace where</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">they have</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.360" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">um the security that they will not be</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">abandoned</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">and we should be working on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">and and creating a counter narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">can grab the claim of virtuous and moral</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:09.760" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s going to be critical</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.760" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:13.520" style="s2">well i mean the thing is so many people</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.520" end="00:24:17.279" style="s2">it&#39;s just true but i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">catchy soundbite</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.279" end="00:24:21.600" style="s2">version of this actually resisting that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:22.240" style="s2">thing that&#39;s claiming to be virtuous and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.600" end="00:24:24.720" style="s2">moral</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.240" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">is in fact the virtuous and moral path</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.720" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">it is i don&#39;t have the narrative on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">yet though</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">i mean it seems to me uh unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:38.080" style="s2">catchy but yeah the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:40.159" style="s2">do we continue with the project that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.080" end="00:24:42.559" style="s2">were on and finish it</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.159" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">and make a fair society or do we unmake</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.559" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">that society because it was so</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">desperately unfair as it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">and that is it is actually isn&#39;t it and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">um the classic framing of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">progressivism versus conservatism</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">involves a line without branches yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:00.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:01.840" style="s2">um there might be new branches there</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.640" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">might be forks to take</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.840" end="00:25:05.360" style="s2">and some of those forks might actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">take require going back a little bit and</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.360" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">then taking a different</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">different road um but this thing this</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:12.960" style="s2">critical race theory post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">black lives matter the riots in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.960" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">streets um</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">really explicitly is about burn it down</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">uh and so you&#39;re not just you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">of course imagining a cladogram an</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:24.799" style="s2">evolutionary tree and it&#39;s like you just</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">you go back to base you just go all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.799" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">way back</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll build something and we</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">someone smarter than me we&#39;ll figure</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:35.200" style="s2">that out right uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:40.000" style="s2">and uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.200" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">that that that is not helpful at all yep</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.000" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">i am a public elementary teacher i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">fighting for enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">reason and american and american</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">yet the post-modern culturally relative</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">anti-racists dominate the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:55.600" style="s2">they want politics to be greater than</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">truth and emotion to be greater than</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.600" end="00:26:02.640" style="s2">facts i don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">quite what that&#39;s supposed to say um</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.640" end="00:26:09.200" style="s2">they&#39;re all women he concludes help</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">um yeah there is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.200" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">i am certain and i have not seen any</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:16.320" style="s2">analysis of this because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:17.760" style="s2">fit the accepted narrative um but i have</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.320" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">long had a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.760" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">based on a number of things that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">won&#39;t go into in depth here</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">um but there is most definitely a gender</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:28.480" style="s2">by which in this case i mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">sex um element to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.480" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">that um women&#39;s greater tendency to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">conform</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">just by like the psychological meaning</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:39.279" style="s2">of conformity</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:42.159" style="s2">and to be affiliative and also</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.279" end="00:26:43.440" style="s2">to tend to have tools in their arsenal</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.159" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">that are less likely to be physical and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.440" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">more likely to be linguistic and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">emotional</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">means that women are more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">the ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:55.520" style="s2">who are leading the charge here</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">and uh just i never completed the</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.520" end="00:26:59.520" style="s2">analysis i just did a simple</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">frankly just a simple chi square when i</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.520" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">first thought about this in light of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">what was going on at evergreen i thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:05.679" style="s2">huh i kind of feel like there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">more women</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.679" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">you know when a at a college with a i</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:11.039" style="s2">can&#39;t remember what it was but</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:12.640" style="s2">you know something like a one-to-one sex</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.039" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">ratio um</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.640" end="00:27:16.000" style="s2">among the faculty i feel like there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">a lot more women who are leading the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.000" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">charge here and going after you and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">was true</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:23.039" style="s2">um so and then i actually began to look</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">and did not complete the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.039" end="00:27:29.919" style="s2">on trying to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">relative rates of</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.919" end="00:27:32.960" style="s2">participation acquiescence and various</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">cults are</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.960" end="00:27:36.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s it takes some doing to figure</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">out exactly which</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.320" end="00:27:40.159" style="s2">lists to use and you know life got in</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:41.840" style="s2">the way and i ended up doing a number of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.159" end="00:27:42.320" style="s2">other things but it looked at a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.840" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.320" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">you know this like i think this is right</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">um like indeed</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.279" style="s2">uh women were more likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">participating in</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.279" end="00:27:52.880" style="s2">these sort of mass movements that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">require complete conformity from all</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.880" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">adherents</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:58.880" style="s2">and that&#39;s uh if that&#39;s true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:02.320" style="s2">unfortunate but it&#39;s true and needs to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.880" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">be something we can talk about i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.320" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">know if</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:05.760" style="s2">i didn&#39;t really address the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:06.640" style="s2">except that he ends with they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:10.960" style="s2">women which</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.640" end="00:28:13.440" style="s2">i think is a fundamental thing here</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.960" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">uh to end the pandemic sequence sars</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.440" end="00:28:16.640" style="s2">covey ii antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">write them into a plasmid insert the</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.640" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">plasmid into a viral vector</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:22.159" style="s2">then inject the vector or aerosolize it</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">is there any reason this won&#39;t work why</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.159" end="00:28:25.120" style="s2">isn&#39;t this being done</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.279" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">um hold on i&#39;ll make sure i get the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:33.840" style="s2">whole plan here sequence the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.080" style="s2">get them into a plasmid insert the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.840" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">plasmid into a different so</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.080" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">some black boxes here it&#39;s the insert</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">the plasmid in the viral vector is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:43.600" style="s2">most obvious</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">so presumably the person is talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.600" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.320" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">growing the antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:55.840" style="s2">in a bacterial culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">no oh i see maybe the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.840" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">this this person wants to gene therapy</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">your way to an immune response</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.640" style="s2">like gene therapy out in the world yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it will work as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.640" end="00:29:08.799" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">scale of the immune response in the body</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.799" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">in other words how many</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">cells do you have to infect with a viral</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">vector that carries the antibody</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:18.960" style="s2">sequence and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.440" end="00:29:26.480" style="s2">it is unclear to me if you can encode</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.200" end="00:29:30.000" style="s2">an antibody into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.480" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">virus and get a cell chosen</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.000" end="00:29:35.120" style="s2">let&#39;s say at random to make the antibody</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.799" style="s2">you know i guess if it were this simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.120" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">this would be how</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.799" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">how vaccines were always made well i</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">think this person is asking</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:43.360" style="s2">why wouldn&#39;t this work and so at some</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.840" end="00:29:44.960" style="s2">level let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a b</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.360" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">cell which is the cell that makes</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.960" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">antibodies that b</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:50.000" style="s2">cell has the machinery that takes the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">sequence that is unique to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.000" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">that are encoded by that b cell</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">and it produces antibodies which are</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:30:01.440" style="s2">then exported to the surface of the cell</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:04.799" style="s2">and spilled into the lymph for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.440" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">so that does not suggest that if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.799" end="00:30:09.039" style="s2">breathed in a virus that contained the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">sequence that makes</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.039" end="00:30:13.440" style="s2">the antibodies and you got it into a</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:15.039" style="s2">lung cell for example</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.440" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">that that lung cell would inherently</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.039" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">produce antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">in other words the machinery is what</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">causes the sequence to produce</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">antibodies so</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">if it were true that you could dump a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.880" style="s2">sequence into</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">any cell and it would export antibodies</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.880" end="00:30:30.320" style="s2">then potentially there&#39;s something down</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">this road but if it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.320" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to reach the cells that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.840" end="00:30:36.320" style="s2">have that machinery</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">so i i think there&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.320" end="00:30:39.440" style="s2">interesting idea yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t think it works as</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.440" end="00:30:44.320" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">great i mean unfortunate but lovely it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.320" end="00:30:47.760" style="s2">not great yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:48.840" style="s2">how can i help my left-leaning friends</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.760" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">see the danger in left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.840" end="00:30:52.399" style="s2">authoritarianism they&#39;re not extremists</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:53.520" style="s2">just normal reasonable folks caught up</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.399" end="00:30:54.960" style="s2">in the rhetoric</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.520" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">i love all the sanity from the live</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.960" end="00:30:58.880" style="s2">streams parenthesis not sarcasm</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">yeah how do you get it to see it i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.600" end="00:31:04.799" style="s2">i feel like god we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">we keep getting some version of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.799" end="00:31:07.039" style="s2">question and i keep on really wanting us</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.039" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">figure out how to answer it i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.519" style="s2">think we figured it out i think the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">thing is if it were figurable</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.519" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">in that sense then it&#39;d be figured yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">i mean at one level</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that there can&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.320" style="s2">single answer you know it&#39;s it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">to be context specific</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.320" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">whatever the answer is so it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">be particular to</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">your friends you know but also you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:28.159" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">you&#39;re writing that so you&#39;re here</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.159" end="00:31:33.519" style="s2">listening to us uh it&#39;s not like we</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">succeeded at this when this when this</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.519" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">first happened in our world</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">right there there were several people</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:41.440" style="s2">in our community many of whom we called</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">friends uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.440" end="00:31:46.640" style="s2">who uh flipped on us</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:48.000" style="s2">none of our students did right but many</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.640" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">of our colleagues our so-called</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:55.679" style="s2">on the faculty and the staff so</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:58.840" style="s2">we clearly don&#39;t there is no</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.679" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">even we didn&#39;t have a complete answer</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:03.039" style="s2">although although i will say however</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.039" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">the fact that our our students didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.559" style="s2">flip on us and it was the students our</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">students with whom we had a closer</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.559" end="00:32:13.840" style="s2">relationship you know we we had</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:15.200" style="s2">we had we had led every program with</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.840" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">care and compassion</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.200" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">and and and in an anti-authoritarian way</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:22.880" style="s2">telling them do not do not trust me do</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.000" style="s2">not trust us simply because i&#39;m the one</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">up here with a degree and</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.000" end="00:32:28.080" style="s2">going to be writing your narrative</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:29.200" style="s2">evaluation at the end whereas</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">the relationships that we have with</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.200" end="00:32:33.039" style="s2">adults in our lives uh don&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">tolerate that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.039" end="00:32:36.480" style="s2">right they they don&#39;t tend to allow for</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:39.440" style="s2">that much</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.480" end="00:32:40.720" style="s2">um playing around with what actually are</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.440" end="00:32:41.919" style="s2">the boundaries of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.720" end="00:32:43.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re supposed to push and what</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.919" end="00:32:45.039" style="s2">you&#39;re not and it&#39;s rare that a friend</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.760" end="00:32:46.320" style="s2">can tell another friend come on i want</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.039" end="00:32:48.399" style="s2">you to push me around please push me</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.320" end="00:32:52.559" style="s2">around i&#39;ll push you in response</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.399" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">um so you know maybe looking forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.559" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">establishing as you&#39;re coming to know</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:56.080" style="s2">people that that&#39;s sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">expectation</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.080" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s something i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:32:59.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever been explicit about this but</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">it&#39;s something that you</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.120" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">do you just you push people around</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:04.399" style="s2">whether or not they want to be pushed</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:05.600" style="s2">either they stick around like oh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.399" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">know what that was but it kind of made</p>

<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">think there&#39;s also something</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.279" end="00:33:40.240" style="s2">to the selection process where you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">you kind of want to discover that people</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.240" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:44.799" style="s2">don&#39;t lose their minds when somebody</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">tries to manipulate them</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.799" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">and what&#39;s really happening is that this</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">ideology is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">manipulating people and most of them do</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:56.320" style="s2">not have the tools to resist it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">in some sense the friendship process</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.320" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">tends to default too much to</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">do we believe the same things do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:09.679" style="s2">have the same interests when in fact</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s in many ways much more important</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.679" end="00:34:14.800" style="s2">that somebody uh share your values even</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">if they see the world differently</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.800" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">and frankly those are the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:18.079" style="s2">interesting friends to have in any case</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:20.000" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.079" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">those friends often know something you</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.000" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">don&#39;t but they&#39;re trustworthy and so</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:26.720" style="s2">you do have more disagreements but</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:30.560" style="s2">they&#39;re also</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">from i think we have found ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">in very dangerous waters</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:25.119" style="s2">it can get worse from here easily and</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">will if we do nothing</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.000" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">comes so late in a process</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.040" style="s2">that it is misleading the fact that you</p>

<p begin="00:38:47.040" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">um shouldn&#39;t be nearly as comforting as</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">so so do you have a replacement</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">suggestion</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:58.720" style="s2">i mean the question is you know is this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">podcast a</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.720" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">from the hills podcast i think it might</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">right if we headed for the hills i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:07.520" style="s2">we did so</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:09.599" style="s2">what do you expand on that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.520" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">what do you mean well you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.599" end="00:39:13.280" style="s2">you may not remember this but at one</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:15.040" style="s2">point we were tenured professors and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">we had a day job and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.040" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">remember that um</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:22.320" style="s2">and so anyway that was a plan we could</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.160" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">have attempted to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.320" end="00:39:25.920" style="s2">stick with that plan which would have</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">required us to compromise ourselves in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.920" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">way that we wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:33.200" style="s2">so we didn&#39;t and that meant</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:33.599" style="s2">that we left some structure in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.200" end="00:39:36.240" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.599" end="00:39:37.520" style="s2">unknown that strikes me as the hills</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.240" end="00:39:40.560" style="s2">from which we are now</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.520" end="00:39:41.920" style="s2">striking back at the thing that uh put</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.560" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">us in jeopardy and it&#39;s now putting the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.920" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">republic in jeopardy so</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:45.599" style="s2">yeah i guess i don&#39;t know what the hills</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">looks like anymore well and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.599" end="00:39:49.839" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">um we&#39;re not equipped as survivalists</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.839" end="00:39:53.599" style="s2">um but we know better than most people</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">who aren&#39;t explicitly in that camp</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">actually what it would take uh to to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:58.000" style="s2">live to actually be autonomous unlike</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:00.079" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.000" end="00:40:01.359" style="s2">the yahoos who claim to be setting up</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.079" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">autonomous zones and are</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.359" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">relying on city water and lights and</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.760" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">cell service and all of this right</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">like we actually do have a sense having</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:11.599" style="s2">lived remotely</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">um in places like madagascar and um and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.599" end="00:40:15.280" style="s2">just having</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">really you know taught a number of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.280" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">these things as well</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:23.920" style="s2">um what would it mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:25.200" style="s2">for people to really start trying to</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.920" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">disassociate</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.200" end="00:40:31.359" style="s2">from the services</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:33.520" style="s2">that we are all currently relying on</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.359" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">such that if they fail</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.520" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">you don&#39;t immediately go down the fact</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">that almost no one can really grow</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:45.359" style="s2">enough food and source enough water</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.119" end="00:40:46.800" style="s2">for themselves and their loved ones that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.359" end="00:40:48.720" style="s2">depends depends where you are</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.800" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">it depends where you are but unless you</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.720" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">already have that setup</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:54.480" style="s2">right and some people do but um you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">heading for the hills</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.480" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">from you know from the house in the city</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure if this question is really</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">literal headaches you know it&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.839" style="s2">though i think it&#39;s metaphorical and</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">it&#39;s literal</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.839" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know how to answer it</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:12.000" style="s2">um yes we are at some moment where some</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:14.640" style="s2">level of heading for the hills</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.000" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">is warranted and has already happened</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.640" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">then there&#39;s obviously a moment at which</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">literally you flee your home</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s not really food</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:25.839" style="s2">enough in the hills</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">right for very many people so</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.839" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">are either of you familiar with dr bruce</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">lipton&#39;s discovery regarding stem cells</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:32.160" style="s2">and epigenetics</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:35.359" style="s2">i find it to be very similar to your</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.160" end="00:41:37.119" style="s2">breath lab mice telomeres discovery</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.359" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know him it&#39;s ringing a bell but</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.119" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">i can&#39;t quite dredge it up i i agree i</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.319" style="s2">feel the same way</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">all right let&#39;s go to the next zach&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.319" end="00:41:51.680" style="s2">there line there is a line look at that</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">walk into a room with a hundred people</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.680" end="00:41:56.240" style="s2">racially proportional to the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">who do you most want to talk to if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.240" end="00:42:03.040" style="s2">considered values and ability first are</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">you still racist</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.040" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">um i i get maybe this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think i get the</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:12.240" style="s2">i think i get maybe what the question is</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">trying to ask but i don&#39;t believe the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.240" end="00:42:14.640" style="s2">premise of the question yeah i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:16.640" style="s2">believe the premise of the question</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.640" end="00:42:17.680" style="s2">either and you know it&#39;s definitely not</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.640" end="00:42:19.839" style="s2">my instinct</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.680" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">i want to talk to the person who is</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.839" end="00:42:24.640" style="s2">least like me</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">who is most ready to um</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.640" end="00:42:28.720" style="s2">be candid that&#39;s often the most</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">interesting conversation in the room</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.720" end="00:42:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the main reasons</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">that travel is so exciting for both of</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.400" end="00:42:35.680" style="s2">us right that you actually get to engage</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">with people who have so little in common</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.680" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">with you</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">in terms of your uh developmental and uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">geographic and political</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">uh history that you just really learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">something about what being a human is</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">about what the what the commonality is</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">and the commonalities</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">shine through um but you but you learn</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:55.599" style="s2">tremendously and you know so sure you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">know if you walk into a room</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.599" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">interested in you know where your goal</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">is i need to learn about</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">virology and there&#39;s two virologists and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.040" style="s2">98 non-virologists you should probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:06.800" style="s2">talk to virologists first although it</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.040" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">might turn out that they&#39;re yahoos</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">um and um and i don&#39;t i guess i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">if it weren&#39;t 20 20 i would literally</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">have no idea what racist was doing in</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:19.839" style="s2">this in this question</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">you know and i i i it just doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.839" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong there i think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:25.040" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:29.280" style="s2">asking if a prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.040" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">is accurate are you</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.280" end="00:43:32.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s not racist it&#39;s prejudice are</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:35.280" style="s2">you prejudiced are you a bigot</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.560" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">you know are you a values bigot i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.280" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:39.440" style="s2">you know a prejudice doesn&#39;t tell you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.599" end="00:43:41.280" style="s2">very much a prejudice can be accurate</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.440" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">like a prejudice you know if</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.280" end="00:43:48.480" style="s2">if you describe somebody as a woman</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">then i have a prejudice about the likely</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.480" end="00:43:52.240" style="s2">uh you know her height yeah right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:54.079" style="s2">based on</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.240" end="00:43:55.280" style="s2">an actual experience of women being</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.079" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">shorter on average</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.280" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">so that&#39;s not a pernicious prejudice</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:00.079" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:02.720" style="s2">but i mean let&#39;s a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.079" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">complicated um</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.720" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">everyone i would pause it um and there</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">will be a few exceptions i&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">um it has a prejudice for attractive</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.760" style="s2">because attractive is the prejudice that</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">selection has built in that is an</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.760" end="00:44:17.920" style="s2">indicator</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">that&#39;s what attractiveness is it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.920" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">it is right like it is it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">actually what it is so that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:27.599" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a tautology and yet it</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:30.319" style="s2">sounds like a grievous insult</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.599" end="00:44:30.720" style="s2">to those who aren&#39;t attractive but but</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.319" end="00:44:32.560" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.720" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">it&#39;s just you know why is it that we</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.560" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">find attractive what we do and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">we can talk about how uh how</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">how cultural norms about what the most</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">attractive body type for instance have</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:45.280" style="s2">changed over time</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">but the fact is that things like</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.280" end="00:44:50.480" style="s2">symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">and and particular kinds of facial</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.480" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:58.240" style="s2">are i think universally across cultures</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">considered more attractive than others</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.240" end="00:45:00.560" style="s2">and you know put aside all the things</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:04.079" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.560" end="00:45:05.359" style="s2">makeup and costuming and tattooing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.079" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">you know other things that people in</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.359" end="00:45:08.160" style="s2">different cultures do to themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">make them more attractive and that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.160" end="00:45:11.599" style="s2">highly culturally specific but</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">attractiveness</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.599" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">um across the board is selection&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:18.079" style="s2">of informing you of</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:19.520" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.079" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">healthy on average</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.520" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">yeah if moms are more related to so</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">okay i&#39;m gonna pause this is gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:27.920" style="s2">this is an echo question so it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:29.680" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.920" end="00:45:31.599" style="s2">interesting but i have to have to give</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.680" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">give it some thought if moms are more</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.599" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">related to sons</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">and dads to daughters so this is picking</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">up on her question from a while ago</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:39.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.800" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to read it first if moms</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">are more related to sons and dads to</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:47.760" style="s2">daughters</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">given that y codes for not very much</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.760" end="00:45:51.520" style="s2">are systems favoring male line</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:53.760" style="s2">descendants like aristocracy</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.520" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">really in favor of the matriarchal line</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.760" end="00:45:56.960" style="s2">in terms of genes</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.079" end="00:46:01.920" style="s2">um i think i follow yeah yeah yeah uh so</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.119" end="00:46:03.040" style="s2">let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.920" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">because this is in reference to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.040" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">question we answered a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:10.720" style="s2">or last q a um the idea being that the y</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">is a very small chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.720" end="00:46:17.680" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:19.440" style="s2">dads are going to be more highly more</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.680" end="00:46:19.839" style="s2">related to their daughters than they are</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.440" end="00:46:22.560" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.839" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">sons because they have given an x</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.560" end="00:46:26.400" style="s2">chromosome to daughters</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:27.839" style="s2">and only a y chromosome to sons and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.400" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">they share just</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.839" end="00:46:31.119" style="s2">there&#39;s just more genome there that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">they&#39;ve given to daughters meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.119" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">genus more meaningful genome but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">are moms do we establishes our moms were</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:37.520" style="s2">related to sons</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m having trouble seeing that i</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.520" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">don&#39;t yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t see that</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:41.599" style="s2">because moms are just</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">moms because they only have the x to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.599" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">give um</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.920" end="00:46:49.119" style="s2">no the idea is that it&#39;s a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">genome overall</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.119" end="00:46:53.280" style="s2">and uh the dad gave the smaller bit and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.280" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">so the mom has contributed a greater</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">fractional percentage of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">total genome to sons okay so we&#39;ve kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">of done the basic</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:05.040" style="s2">genetic relatedness part of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">is it possible if that&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">systems favoring male line descendants</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:13.359" style="s2">like aristocracy are really in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:15.280" style="s2">the matriarchal line</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.359" end="00:47:16.400" style="s2">in terms of genes so i think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.280" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">question is asking</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.400" end="00:47:22.559" style="s2">can it be a driving force yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">my guess is it would be a very very weak</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.559" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">driving force</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">um but i agree although it you know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:31.839" style="s2">it raises for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">is what all is coated on the x and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.839" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">you know we there&#39;s a lot of work on</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">what&#39;s coated on the y</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:38.880" style="s2">uh in part because it&#39;s understood that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:39.680" style="s2">it sets so much important stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.880" end="00:47:42.640" style="s2">motion</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.680" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">in a way that the x doesn&#39;t you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.640" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">x doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:48.400" style="s2">sex specific um instructions because</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">both males and females have an x and</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.400" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">females just have two</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">in mammals so i i would be interested to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">know what is on the x</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">such that um you know moms can drive</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">yeah can can can drive the male line</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">um by virtue of contributing x on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">other hand it&#39;s one of her what&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:09.599" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">and so you know you may have basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.599" end="00:48:14.640" style="s2">competition between the two x&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">yep so there&#39;s also a question</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.640" end="00:48:21.359" style="s2">of uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">is it bar bodies</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.359" end="00:48:26.319" style="s2">the leftover inactivated uh well</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">is it i&#39;m trying to remember which one</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.319" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">of these factors it is in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">somatic cells females typically have one</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">of their x chromosomes</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">inactivated to to compensate for</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">dosage i think that one&#39;s bar bodies</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">although i don&#39;t remember for sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:43.839" style="s2">can&#39;t recall but in any case what i</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">would say is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.839" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">much more dominant factor here rather</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:51.280" style="s2">than the slight difference</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">in relatedness is the certainty of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.280" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">paternity versus certainty of maternity</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:59.920" style="s2">issue so the fact is many fathers aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:49:02.160" style="s2">actually fathers at the genetic level</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.920" end="00:49:03.599" style="s2">that is a much more powerful force than</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.160" end="00:49:05.680" style="s2">the little difference in</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.599" end="00:49:07.359" style="s2">how much sequence identity there is</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">between fathers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.359" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">mothers and sons and daughters so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">that&#39;s certain to be true</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">yeah and that you&#39;re right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">highly explanatory</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">okay so this again would load if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.119" style="s2">address my previous email</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.520" end="00:49:28.319" style="s2">this this is about the the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.800" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">that i tried to read from email that we</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.319" end="00:49:31.839" style="s2">were having a hard time parsing</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.480" end="00:49:37.599" style="s2">thoughts on a third strand dna model</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:40.559" style="s2">many books are out on the topic and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.599" end="00:49:42.839" style="s2">possibility some claim that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.559" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">covet vaccine will add the third strand</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.839" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">covertly</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what this means no i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">know i don&#39;t know what a third strand</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">dna model would</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:53.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know the only thing i know about</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">is um yeah this is certainly not what</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.040" end="00:49:56.960" style="s2">the question&#39;s about but it&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">relevant piece of information i have</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.960" end="00:50:01.119" style="s2">telomeres it turns out are not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">linear sequences that stick off the end</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.119" end="00:50:04.800" style="s2">of a chromosome</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:06.079" style="s2">they form something called a d loop in</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.800" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.079" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">there&#39;s a free so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:12.000" style="s2">double-stranded dna that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">looped over and one strand goes farther</p>

<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:51:02.319" style="s2">in 24 hours but not</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">not long thereafter you will have um</p>

<p begin="00:51:09.040" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">hopes of ascertaining ideologies and</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:13.599" style="s2">aims</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:15.920" style="s2">is that worthwhile also do you have any</p>

<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:59.839" style="s2">is it worthwhile to uh try</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.839" end="00:52:01.440" style="s2">to interview portland protesters and</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.839" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">rioters what do you think</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.440" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">potentially nancy</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">i find people pretty pretty ready to</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.800" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">talk um and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">i do think the discovery of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:15.280" style="s2">variance in what they think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">advocating</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.280" end="00:52:21.200" style="s2">is certainly worth documenting um</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">that that is conspicuous and it is part</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.200" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">of this feat</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">uh this leaderless movement um and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:29.119" style="s2">very frightening part because</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:31.119" style="s2">there are lots of people there marching</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.119" end="00:52:33.599" style="s2">for something that sounds reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.119" end="00:52:34.960" style="s2">but they&#39;re marching along with people</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.599" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.960" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">are advocating for things that are</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:39.599" style="s2">absolutely insane right</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:42.800" style="s2">as someone considering going into</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">research science are there any</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.800" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">alternatives to playing the grant</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">writing game</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:49.760" style="s2">like starting a company perhaps yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:52.800" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.760" end="00:52:55.040" style="s2">standard uh other thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.800" end="00:52:56.240" style="s2">although uh you&#39;re probably then looking</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.040" end="00:52:58.400" style="s2">for venture capital</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.240" end="00:52:59.280" style="s2">um you know because it takes a while to</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.400" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">to you know r</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:03.119" style="s2">d is very expensive long long time that</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:04.079" style="s2">you need money before you end up with</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.119" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.079" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">if you&#39;re running a company um</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.559" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">yeah the grant writing game is the only</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.119" style="s2">game in town in academia the one</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">exception was this little college in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.119" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">pacific northwest called evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.880" style="s2">which as i understand it is rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">going out of business</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.880" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">um but it explicitly uh actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">all they need is for trump to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:32.240" style="s2">that it is failing</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:33.599" style="s2">which means that it will be succeeding</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.240" end="00:53:35.119" style="s2">it will</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.599" end="00:53:36.880" style="s2">yeah no they they should they should</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.119" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.880" end="00:53:40.559" style="s2">you know what would they have to do to</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:42.960" style="s2">get him to declare them a failure</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.559" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">because that would the donations would</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.960" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">through the roof</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">yeah oh my god don&#39;t don&#39;t help them</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">game this</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.480" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">um yeah so i scrolled way too far um</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.760" end="00:53:58.480" style="s2">starting a company is there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:02.160" style="s2">a lot of ways that can look but yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.480" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good alternative</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.160" end="00:54:06.559" style="s2">do you think the social justice movement</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">has morphed into a social eugenicist</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.559" end="00:54:12.000" style="s2">movement um</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:13.119" style="s2">i&#39;m not totally sure what that means i</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:15.280" style="s2">can&#39;t um</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.119" end="00:54:17.119" style="s2">i suspect it means something but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.280" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">well i mean look there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.119" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">hints of this nonsense yeah no actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">i do who you&#39;re required to find</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:24.640" style="s2">attractive and</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">mate with and all this stuff the cotton</p>

<p begin="00:54:27.200" end="00:54:31.280" style="s2">um so anyway look i i wouldn&#39;t put it</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:32.720" style="s2">past them i</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.280" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think they&#39;re quite there yet but</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.720" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">no one actually um now that</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s had time to enter my brain and</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:40.319" style="s2">percolate a little bit it was never</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.160" end="00:54:42.160" style="s2">about justice</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.319" end="00:54:44.480" style="s2">just like black lives matter seems to</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.160" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">have relatively little to do with black</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.480" end="00:54:49.280" style="s2">lives mattering</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">and it was as we have said many times</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.280" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">many places</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:54.559" style="s2">about turning the tables of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">rather than achieving actual equality of</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.559" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">opportunity as much as</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">possible and uh to turn the tables</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:05.920" style="s2">and to uh turn and to turn the tables</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">in this way it appears to require that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.920" end="00:55:08.640" style="s2">you take some demographics and blame</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:10.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.640" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">and uh and yeah that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.160" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">what&#39;s being done</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:16.400" style="s2">regarding losing liberal friends who</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">think you&#39;re too centrist peter bogosian</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.400" end="00:55:19.680" style="s2">talks about disabusing</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:22.079" style="s2">friends and colleagues and it starts</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.680" end="00:55:26.799" style="s2">with empathy for their concerns</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.079" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">unyielding didacticism is a bad strategy</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.799" end="00:55:30.720" style="s2">yeah i think actually in his and jim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:33.040" style="s2">book uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.720" end="00:55:34.400" style="s2">how to have impossible conversations he</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.040" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">talks about this um</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.400" end="00:55:39.680" style="s2">he does and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a good approach so</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.680" end="00:55:44.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference though</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.280" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">uh i took the original question to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.000" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">about what to do about</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">friends that you have lost and my sense</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:50.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different puzzle than how</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.040" style="s2">to address friends who</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.799" end="00:55:53.839" style="s2">disagree with you and are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.040" end="00:55:57.200" style="s2">your cross side</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.839" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">so that is not a hopeless predicament</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.200" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">absolutely um so anyway i did not mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:02.720" style="s2">to dismiss i did not mean to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.359" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">cut your friends loose at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.720" end="00:56:06.559" style="s2">they say something crazy</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.280" end="00:56:12.559" style="s2">do you have a book recommendation on</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">evolving ecosystems i want to learn</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.559" end="00:56:14.880" style="s2">about their efficiency for a personal</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">research project</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.880" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">thanks well ecosystems don&#39;t evolve</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:21.520" style="s2">so that&#39;s going to be a problem with</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:24.079" style="s2">regard to any</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.520" end="00:56:25.200" style="s2">hypothesis that requires that they do</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.079" end="00:56:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not to say that there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.200" end="00:56:30.160" style="s2">people claiming that they do</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.720" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">but they don&#39;t yep something they change</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.160" end="00:56:33.920" style="s2">over time</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:34.799" style="s2">based on the evolution of creatures</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.920" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">within them</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.799" end="00:56:39.359" style="s2">and somebody just pointed out on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:40.880" style="s2">this um</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.359" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">this interesting process that happened</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.880" end="00:56:43.839" style="s2">in yellowstone following the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">reintroduction of wolves and actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.839" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">they wanted our input on it</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">where there was an entire cascade of</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:52.400" style="s2">phenomena where the ecology</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">changed radically because this predator</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.400" end="00:56:56.240" style="s2">began</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">not only eliminating deer including</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.240" end="00:56:59.280" style="s2">elk and moose and things like that um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:01.839" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.280" end="00:57:03.280" style="s2">also causing those animals to behave</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.839" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">differently where those animals</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.280" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">had no predator they are suddenly wary</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">of certain places which means that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:10.240" style="s2">things that they eat</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">are now returning to places that they</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.240" end="00:57:13.440" style="s2">had been excluded so anyway a whole</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:16.640" style="s2">cascade of effects that has</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.440" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">all sorts of yes uh downstream uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.640" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">in some cases literally creatures you</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:22.240" style="s2">know right beavers</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:24.000" style="s2">well that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.240" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">community ecology is supposed to be it</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.000" end="00:57:26.799" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:29.040" style="s2">it should be right um but but the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.799" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">ecosystems themselves</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.040" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">aren&#39;t evolving units an ecosystem can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:34.079" style="s2">reproduce itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:36.000" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not evolving and this i</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.079" end="00:57:38.880" style="s2">mean frankly i mean we&#39;ve begun to hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.000" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">from some um honorable seeming and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.880" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">awesome seeming ecologists who</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">um are listening and taking issue with</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:46.880" style="s2">our occasional pointed barbs at</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">ecologists</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.880" end="00:57:50.319" style="s2">um and it is in fact a long-standing you</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.319" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">this is one of our our beefs with our</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:57.680" style="s2">field that um</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">too many ecologists seem to stop uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.680" end="00:58:01.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">evolution shows up and say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.280" end="00:58:04.400" style="s2">not that&#39;s not my concern</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.799" end="00:58:09.520" style="s2">obviously ecology and evolution should</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:10.880" style="s2">be understood together should be learned</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.520" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">should be should be learned together</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.880" end="00:58:16.400" style="s2">should be there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">directly interrelated fields um but</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.400" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">there is i mean just as there are many</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">bad evolutionary biologists</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:25.079" style="s2">um but there are whole sub-disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:26.400" style="s2">in ecology that seem explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.079" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">anti-evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.400" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">uh and uh the field of ecosystem ecology</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">seems particularly confused on this</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:34.960" style="s2">front</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:36.079" style="s2">uh and you know i i&#39;m not gonna tell</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.960" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">these stories</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.079" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna tell stories out of school</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">here now but um</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">i i have i have worked with people who</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:45.440" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">have been so confused on this point that</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.440" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">it rendered them incapable of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:50.720" style="s2">doing basic science and these are phd</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:52.559" style="s2">scientists</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.720" end="00:58:54.079" style="s2">yep i would agree um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.559" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">there&#39;s dysfunction on the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.079" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">side too</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:59:01.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a blindness to ecology but</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">um it is less pronounced evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.119" end="00:59:04.799" style="s2">biologists at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">those who study adaptive processes are</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.799" end="00:59:08.480" style="s2">well aware that ecology is important</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:09.839" style="s2">yes they have little patience for it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.480" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">general and in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.839" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">ecology space there&#39;s actually appears</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">to be a belief that you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.480" style="s2">understand the evolutionary stuff or</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:18.559" style="s2">that it&#39;s so obvious</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.480" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">that um we all get it and we can just</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.559" end="00:59:22.480" style="s2">move on right</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">i guess probably this won&#39;t be relevant</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.480" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">to this person asking but um</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.319" style="s2">another bretner i used textbooks hardly</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:30.559" style="s2">ever</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.319" end="00:59:33.520" style="s2">um but there was one textbook that i</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.559" end="00:59:34.160" style="s2">often made an optional text when i was</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.520" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">teaching</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.160" end="00:59:38.480" style="s2">a population level like animal behavior</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">and vertebrate zoology and such</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">which is eric pianka&#39;s book that is</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">literally called evolutionary ecology</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.119" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s excellent and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not confused</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:49.920" style="s2">about whether or not ecosystems evolve</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:52.400" style="s2">or communities evolve</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.920" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">um but it&#39;s it is very much both an</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.400" end="00:59:54.960" style="s2">evolutionary and an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:58.160" style="s2">investigation</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.960" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">into what is true um of uh complex</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.160" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">living systems</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s really in in my opinion it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:07.599" style="s2">an attempt to form a field that</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:08.880" style="s2">should have yeah taken over the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.599" end="01:00:11.280" style="s2">interface between</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.880" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">evolution and ecology and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.280" end="01:00:14.799" style="s2">um it&#39;s still singular</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:16.559" style="s2">it didn&#39;t it&#39;s this one pretty smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.799" end="01:00:17.119" style="s2">small it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.559" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">small</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.119" end="01:00:20.400" style="s2">but fabulously expensive of course i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:23.280" style="s2">sure yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.400" end="01:00:24.000" style="s2">at this point um textbook that is you</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.280" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">know it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.000" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2">not highly technical like even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">not super mathy you know he</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:31.280" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s some math there but</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.119" style="s2">you can you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.280" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">delve deep in into the calculus to</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.119" end="01:00:36.000" style="s2">understand almost anything in the book</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:37.440" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.000" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">it&#39;s terrific and you&#39;re right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.440" end="01:00:41.280" style="s2">singular yep he contacted me after the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:44.079" style="s2">evergreen</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.280" end="01:00:45.520" style="s2">uh what ut austin i think something like</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.079" end="01:00:47.440" style="s2">that forgotten where he is but yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.520" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">anyway he had a lovely interaction</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.440" end="01:00:51.599" style="s2">blizzard guy yep</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.200" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">he likes lizards human but he studies</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.599" end="01:00:55.280" style="s2">lizards he&#39;s that kind that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:57.359" style="s2">wants you to believe</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.280" end="01:00:58.799" style="s2">in this area you have to be very clear i</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.359" end="01:01:02.480" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.799" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">oh boy uh we&#39;re an hour okay i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.480" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">totally sure where we were</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna pick two more that i see here</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">and then we will</p>

<p begin="01:01:23.440" end="01:01:26.799" style="s2">yeah in some sense you have to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.359" end="01:01:30.160" style="s2">something that nourishes</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.799" end="01:01:32.000" style="s2">that part of the human psyche i keep</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.160" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">saying it can&#39;t be a religion but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.000" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">know you formulated it as a meta</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:37.359" style="s2">religion and i agree it has to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">something and in fact what we see</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.359" end="01:01:44.400" style="s2">in this movement is a malformed</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:46.960" style="s2">version of this it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.400" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">not metaphorical it&#39;s phony baloney</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.960" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:50.799" style="s2">and that phony baloney stuff is</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:54.000" style="s2">misleading people because it</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.799" end="01:01:56.640" style="s2">promises them something and uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.000" end="01:01:57.119" style="s2">an honorable version that promised them</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.640" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:02:04.480" style="s2">attainable based on logic and things</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:05.920" style="s2">would be much more effective yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.480" end="01:02:07.119" style="s2">okay one more question but there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.920" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">comments here that i&#39;m going to read</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.119" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">because they&#39;re nice</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">just wanted to say i love you too thank</p>

<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">message of reason deserves to be boosted</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.000" end="01:02:22.319" style="s2">all right yeah neither of us likes doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">it but no i hate it yeah but we hit</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.319" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">200 000 subscribers today that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:32.079" style="s2">that&#39;s excellent okay final question</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.200" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">candy that&#39;s abram x kendi argues that</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.079" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">all cultures quote are equal in all</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:39.599" style="s2">their divergences</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:41.039" style="s2">saul thomas sowell or sewell says soul i</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:43.280" style="s2">never get it right</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:44.160" style="s2">says quote cultures exist to serve</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.280" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.160" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">and thereby a hierarchy is created what</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.960" style="s2">are your thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:52.079" style="s2">these are the wow such two relevant</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.960" end="01:02:54.640" style="s2">quotes to put right by</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.079" end="01:02:55.920" style="s2">side by side that&#39;s good yeah so candy</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.640" end="01:02:57.200" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.920" end="01:02:59.599" style="s2">all cultures are equal in all their</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.200" end="01:03:01.200" style="s2">divergences so will cultures exist to</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.599" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">serve people and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">there is a hierarchy yeah i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">candy fan but</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:11.520" style="s2">uh he&#39;s not really wrong</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">in the sense that culture is</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.520" end="01:03:15.119" style="s2">adaptive in the same way that genes are</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.119" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">it is a match for a set of problems</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:26.000" style="s2">so all cultures that exist are</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:28.559" style="s2">valid um but they&#39;re not all</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.000" end="01:03:29.359" style="s2">equally adaptive under all circumstances</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.559" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">right in fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.359" end="01:03:31.920" style="s2">they are they will be adapted to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:33.680" style="s2">opposite maximally adapted for a</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.920" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">particular place sometime in which they</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.680" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">evolved</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">but you know can you say is uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.319" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">are ants better than elephants</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">right right that&#39;s not a legit question</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">people are adults go</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">right yeah you can&#39;t do it so the point</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">is all cultures are valid relative to</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">the problems they evolve to solve</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:50.640" style="s2">to the extent that one wants to say is</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:53.760" style="s2">there a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.640" end="01:03:54.160" style="s2">well there actually is extinct cultures</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.760" end="01:03:56.799" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.160" end="01:03:58.799" style="s2">inferior to the ones that replaced them</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.799" end="01:04:00.160" style="s2">so and that&#39;s not to say that sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:01.760" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t chance</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.160" end="01:04:03.599" style="s2">right some sometimes things will have</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.760" end="01:04:06.640" style="s2">licked that blinked out of existence</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.599" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">uh due to bad luck but not always right</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.640" end="01:04:11.680" style="s2">but in general a sequential</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:13.359" style="s2">uh pattern is going to result in</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.680" end="01:04:14.799" style="s2">improvement relative to the problems</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.359" end="01:04:15.839" style="s2">that are consistent in the environment</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.799" end="01:04:19.039" style="s2">so that exists</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.839" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">too but soul is right</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.039" end="01:04:25.039" style="s2">that um cultures exist to serve</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">people that these are means to an end</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.039" end="01:04:27.599" style="s2">which is something that cultural</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:30.480" style="s2">anthropologists bought</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.599" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">oh so badly amazingly right they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.480" end="01:04:33.359" style="s2">understand that these are means to an</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:33.680" style="s2">end and the most frightening thing of</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.359" end="01:04:35.599" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.680" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">well this is i mean this we don&#39;t need a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.599" end="01:04:39.280" style="s2">cultural anthropology lesson here but</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.960" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">this i point at clifford geertz</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.280" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">uh most most strongly here and say you</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:46.640" style="s2">know he started this madness</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">that culture is basically entirely</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.640" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">random you could basically pick yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">it&#39;s arbitrary you could say this</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:52.000" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:53.760" style="s2">these people oh you could just swap them</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.000" end="01:04:54.559" style="s2">and it would just be just as likely to</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.760" end="01:04:56.720" style="s2">have evolved</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.559" end="01:04:57.839" style="s2">no that is exactly not what culture is</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.720" end="01:05:00.799" style="s2">right so</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.839" end="01:05:02.000" style="s2">the punch line here is that culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.799" end="01:05:03.839" style="s2">evolves</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.000" end="01:05:06.000" style="s2">to serve the genetic interests of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.839" end="01:05:08.720" style="s2">individuals that hold that culture</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">and that has frightening implications</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.720" end="01:05:10.960" style="s2">they are</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:12.880" style="s2">highly relevant to the puzzle that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.960" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">find ourselves trapped in</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.880" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">and we really have to get this right as</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:18.960" style="s2">as bitter a pill as that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:20.240" style="s2">all the hopeful stuff lies beyond our</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.960" end="01:05:22.160" style="s2">understanding of it once we</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.240" end="01:05:24.079" style="s2">get that through our heads then we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.160" end="01:05:25.760" style="s2">figure out how to democratize</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.079" end="01:05:27.119" style="s2">culture so that we all have access to</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.760" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">the highest quality tools</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.119" end="01:05:31.119" style="s2">and we stop going after each other</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:33.520" style="s2">because to the extent that it serves</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.119" end="01:05:35.280" style="s2">our genetic interests our genes do not</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.520" end="01:05:37.599" style="s2">want things for us</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.280" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">that match the values that we all</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.599" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">actually hold</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:42.559" style="s2">right so their teams may want you to</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:46.880" style="s2">engage in genocide but</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.559" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">um don&#39;t do it get done yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.880" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">all right i think we&#39;re there we&#39;re</p>
