<p begin="00:00:08.900" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">absolutely not however what we can do is</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.030" end="00:00:19.949" style="s2">navigate to such a world and this at</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">first may seem like a very minor</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.949" end="00:00:25.769" style="s2">difference but I think actually the</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">difference is major and when people come</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.769" end="00:00:32.640" style="s2">to understand it it will I hope</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">free us from certain facile notions that</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.640" end="00:00:39.600" style="s2">we often pick up and point us in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:41.850" style="s2">direction of useful replacements that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.600" end="00:00:47.100" style="s2">what I mean by that</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.850" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">those of us who make objects think of</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.100" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">something and then try to bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">the world whether it&#39;s a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">furniture or a machine of some kind get</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.210" end="00:00:59.489" style="s2">familiar with the process of prototyping</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:01.500" style="s2">a prototype is on the one hand a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.489" end="00:01:05.339" style="s2">bit paradoxical if you view it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.500" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">isolation so if you if you make a</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.339" end="00:01:10.500" style="s2">prototype of some machine that you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:14.550" style="s2">would be useful to have that prototype</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.500" end="00:01:17.160" style="s2">is liable to be clumsy it&#39;s liable not</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.550" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">to be intuitive it&#39;s liable to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.160" end="00:01:21.899" style="s2">inefficient and so the amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">and effort that you put into building a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.899" end="00:01:28.800" style="s2">prototype tends to far outstrip whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:30.690" style="s2">savings or improvement you would get out</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.800" end="00:01:32.610" style="s2">of the thing but that&#39;s not really the</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.690" end="00:01:35.580" style="s2">product of a prototype a prototype is</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.610" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">not designed to solve the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.580" end="00:01:40.200" style="s2">it is built around it is designed to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">teach you what you don&#39;t know so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.200" end="00:01:46.470" style="s2">you can make an object that ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">will save time and energy or make you</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.470" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">more effective at doing something so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.799" end="00:01:54.110" style="s2">what we need to understand is that very</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.420" end="00:01:57.689" style="s2">often the inventor does not realize</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.110" end="00:01:59.939" style="s2">enough of a savings or an improvement to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.689" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">justify the massive expenditure in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.939" end="00:02:06.840" style="s2">series of prototypes the market pays</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">them to do this work by getting a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.840" end="00:02:11.220" style="s2">of people to buy the end product so each</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:14.160" style="s2">of the prototypes may be very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.220" end="00:02:16.380" style="s2">in terms of time and resources but the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.160" end="00:02:18.750" style="s2">end product is then something that you</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:23.549" style="s2">can produce many copies of and people</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.750" end="00:02:26.130" style="s2">will will get to use them if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.549" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">understood that when we are attempting</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.130" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">to structure a society that we are</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">actually involved in the same process</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:35.790" style="s2">that we should know where in our minds</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:37.700" style="s2">have the idea that we know so much about</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.790" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">the way human beings function or the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.700" end="00:02:42.360" style="s2">systems are going to interact with human</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">psychology that we can design a system</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.360" end="00:02:46.650" style="s2">that works really really well but</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">instead what we can do is separate the</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.650" end="00:02:52.919" style="s2">problem into puzzles that we can solve</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:54.449" style="s2">and build a prototype that tells us if</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.919" end="00:02:55.590" style="s2">we&#39;re in the right neighborhood and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.449" end="00:02:57.709" style="s2">teaches us what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.590" end="00:03:00.300" style="s2">now about the interactions of certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.709" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">mechanisms for example then we can get</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.300" end="00:03:08.849" style="s2">there so what I&#39;ve been saying for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:10.980" style="s2">last several years is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.849" end="00:03:15.349" style="s2">relatively easy actually surprisingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.980" end="00:03:18.959" style="s2">easy to figure out what values we should</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.349" end="00:03:21.390" style="s2">share and therefore what a successful</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.959" end="00:03:25.500" style="s2">civilization would have to do in order</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.390" end="00:03:28.849" style="s2">for us to regard it as as such once we</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.500" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">name those values and we figure out some</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.849" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">prioritization mechanism so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.040" end="00:03:37.620" style="s2">figure out when their attention between</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.239" end="00:03:41.700" style="s2">these things if they&#39;re always are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.620" end="00:03:44.819" style="s2">which way that tension should pull we</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.700" end="00:03:48.599" style="s2">can begin to prototype a mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.819" end="00:03:51.209" style="s2">that returns on those those values it is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.599" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">a navigation problem more than it is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.209" end="00:03:59.040" style="s2">design problem you do have to design a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:04:03.120" style="s2">prototype but that prototype will reveal</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.040" end="00:04:05.400" style="s2">the opportunities that you&#39;ve bypassed</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.120" end="00:04:07.859" style="s2">it will reveal flaws and your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.400" end="00:04:10.290" style="s2">and it will allow you to take the next</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.859" end="00:04:14.670" style="s2">step and so I would argue that this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.290" end="00:04:16.919" style="s2">almost that navigation is almost literal</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.670" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">but we obviously use navigation as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.919" end="00:04:22.139" style="s2">metaphor but that when we think of an</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">engineer as designing a mechanism they</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.139" end="00:04:29.789" style="s2">are basically bringing a physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">hypothesis into being that hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.789" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">tests their understanding of how other</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:37.139" style="s2">systems interact and then they bring a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:40.620" style="s2">next version into being and it is a it</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.139" end="00:04:43.229" style="s2">is like traversing design space in an</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.620" end="00:04:46.530" style="s2">effort to achieve some objective in</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.229" end="00:04:48.539" style="s2">building a better civilization that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.530" end="00:04:50.729" style="s2">what we must do and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.539" end="00:04:53.460" style="s2">founders founding fathers of the United</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.729" end="00:04:57.270" style="s2">States knew this to some extent they</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.460" end="00:04:58.740" style="s2">understood that they were not building a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.270" end="00:04:59.880" style="s2">final product they understood that there</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.740" end="00:05:02.099" style="s2">were things about the future that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.880" end="00:05:04.409" style="s2">couldn&#39;t anticipate and they expected us</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.099" end="00:05:07.979" style="s2">to modify their</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.409" end="00:05:09.929" style="s2">a great deal I have course can&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.979" end="00:05:13.139" style="s2">but I suspect they would be shocked at</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.929" end="00:05:15.629" style="s2">how reluctant we&#39;ve been to modify their</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.139" end="00:05:18.360" style="s2">experiment we have to be a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.629" end="00:05:20.789" style="s2">proactive though the founders did not</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.360" end="00:05:21.959" style="s2">know about adaptive evolution they</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.789" end="00:05:25.019" style="s2">didn&#39;t understand that they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.959" end="00:05:27.059" style="s2">building a system that would evolve over</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.019" end="00:05:29.729" style="s2">time and because they didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.059" end="00:05:31.499" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t build in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.729" end="00:05:34.110" style="s2">safeguards to deal with the fact that an</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.499" end="00:05:38.279" style="s2">evolutionary system doesn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.110" end="00:05:41.699" style="s2">do what you spell out in setting and in</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.699" end="00:05:46.139" style="s2">it finds dictate that it should do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.489" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">have to anticipate that and to realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.139" end="00:05:50.669" style="s2">that many of the niches that the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:53.219" style="s2">we build we&#39;ll find are things that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.669" end="00:05:55.589" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to discover or exploit we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.219" end="00:06:01.379" style="s2">do not want it for example taking</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.589" end="00:06:03.479" style="s2">advantage of defects in our social</p>

<p begin="00:06:12.269" end="00:06:19.189" style="s2">we would like to stamp out and we would</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.959" end="00:06:21.269" style="s2">like it to allow people to explore</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.189" end="00:06:24.300" style="s2">mechanisms that actually enhance the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.269" end="00:06:26.519" style="s2">lives of other people so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.300" end="00:06:29.009" style="s2">recognize that that&#39;s not a natural</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.519" end="00:06:30.749" style="s2">phenomenon that nature involves</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.009" end="00:06:32.909" style="s2">creatures exploiting other creatures all</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.749" end="00:06:36.149" style="s2">the time if we allow markets to simply</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.909" end="00:06:38.009" style="s2">explore space they will discover many</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.149" end="00:06:40.289" style="s2">things that are valuable and desirable</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.009" end="00:06:44.789" style="s2">but they will discover maybe even more</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.289" end="00:06:47.279" style="s2">things that are net negative for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.789" end="00:06:49.619" style="s2">population there&#39;s no reason to allow</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.279" end="00:06:51.269" style="s2">markets to dictate what it is that we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.619" end="00:06:53.969" style="s2">can do just simply on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.269" end="00:06:56.909" style="s2">whatever is profitable we have to guide</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.969" end="00:06:58.469" style="s2">them we have to effectively take the</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.469" end="00:07:01.589" style="s2">markets and harness it so that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.019" end="00:07:04.289" style="s2">produces</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.589" end="00:07:05.699" style="s2">things that are honorable and good and</p>

<p begin="00:07:13.840" end="00:07:19.629" style="s2">should pursue is not so difficult most</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.860" end="00:08:46.060" style="s2">population competition is an existential</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:50.160" style="s2">threat in an era where some populations</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.060" end="00:08:53.250" style="s2">have large nuclear arsenals where</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.160" end="00:08:56.500" style="s2">biological warfare is going to become</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.250" end="00:08:58.149" style="s2">increasingly accessible at a</p>

<p begin="00:08:58.149" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">smaller powers</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.990" end="00:09:04.930" style="s2">we can&#39;t allow a world that is governed</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:09.930" style="s2">by small tyrannical forces that wish to</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.930" end="00:09:11.590" style="s2">deploy technology against the average</p>

<p begin="00:09:11.590" end="00:09:18.760" style="s2">so we have to somehow negate that risk</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.300" end="00:09:21.910" style="s2">that risk comes from our built-in</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.760" end="00:09:23.590" style="s2">competition between populations our</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.910" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">tendency to compete with other</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.590" end="00:09:28.150" style="s2">populations and to cooperate therefore</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:29.800" style="s2">with our own population has been a key</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.150" end="00:09:31.300" style="s2">to the success of all the populations</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.800" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">that exist currently on the earth today</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.300" end="00:09:36.250" style="s2">and it is now an existential threat</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:41.650" style="s2">going forward so somehow we have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.250" end="00:09:45.460" style="s2">neutralize the tendency of that instinct</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.650" end="00:09:51.160" style="s2">to control our behavior and that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.460" end="00:09:54.010" style="s2">going to require us to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.160" end="00:09:57.100" style="s2">the experience that people have that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.010" end="00:10:00.910" style="s2">world that they see does not trigger</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.100" end="00:10:02.350" style="s2">their xenophobia that it triggers their</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.910" end="00:10:03.400" style="s2">collaborative instincts and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.350" end="00:10:05.890" style="s2">actually a process that has been</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.400" end="00:10:08.410" style="s2">evolutionarily unfolding for thousands</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.890" end="00:10:11.230" style="s2">of years where what once would have been</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.410" end="00:10:14.380" style="s2">a feeling of affinity for a tiny number</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.230" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">of individuals all of whose names you</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.380" end="00:10:21.790" style="s2">knew is now a feeling of affinity for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:24.960" style="s2">large population mostly anonymous to you</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.790" end="00:10:30.970" style="s2">so the selection has been engineering a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.960" end="00:10:32.650" style="s2">sense of shared purpose over larger and</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.970" end="00:10:35.380" style="s2">larger populations and we have to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.650" end="00:10:37.300" style="s2">the final step where that a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.380" end="00:10:39.720" style="s2">shared fate actually extends to all</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.300" end="00:10:43.210" style="s2">people so the future is an awesome</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.720" end="00:10:45.640" style="s2">well our future is not headed in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.210" end="00:10:49.030" style="s2">direction of awesome at the moment which</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.640" end="00:10:51.160" style="s2">I realize is out of phase with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.030" end="00:10:53.890" style="s2">conventional wisdom of the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.160" end="00:10:55.660" style="s2">these are the best of times and things</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.890" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">are less violent and more prosperous</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.660" end="00:10:59.020" style="s2">than they&#39;ve ever been in which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:02.170" style="s2">a certain amount of truth in that but</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.020" end="00:11:04.300" style="s2">the problem is if we separate out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.170" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">various values that we might pursue</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.300" end="00:11:07.870" style="s2">we&#39;re doing really well on some and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:09.490" style="s2">really terribly on others and</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.870" end="00:11:12.970" style="s2">unfortunately the places that we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.490" end="00:11:15.700" style="s2">doing worst have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.970" end="00:11:16.790" style="s2">sustainability of our mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.700" end="00:11:19.660" style="s2">living</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.790" end="00:11:24.850" style="s2">and the fragility that we have invited</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.660" end="00:11:28.460" style="s2">into our system so although things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.850" end="00:11:33.340" style="s2">comparatively easy if you are decently</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.460" end="00:11:36.770" style="s2">positioned in society comparatively good</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.340" end="00:11:41.270" style="s2">relative to where an ancestor might have</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.770" end="00:11:42.530" style="s2">been 100 or 200 years ago but they are</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.270" end="00:11:44.930" style="s2">not fair</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.530" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">that is to say depending upon what</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.930" end="00:11:50.450" style="s2">population you&#39;re born into your access</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:53.330" style="s2">to opportunity will vary tremendously so</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.450" end="00:11:56.030" style="s2">that is something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.330" end="00:11:59.870" style="s2">corrected and it is also the case that</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.030" end="00:12:03.290" style="s2">even if things could be made fair that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.870" end="00:12:05.090" style="s2">we are essentially gambling with the</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.290" end="00:12:08.150" style="s2">hazards that we face the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.090" end="00:12:11.600" style="s2">interconnectedness of civilization and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.150" end="00:12:15.320" style="s2">the exponential technology that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.600" end="00:12:17.150" style="s2">utilize are putting us in grave danger</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.320" end="00:12:19.880" style="s2">over the long term and I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.150" end="00:12:22.340" style="s2">one of them this most serious problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.880" end="00:12:26.810" style="s2">is that because our day-to-day existence</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.340" end="00:12:31.790" style="s2">is relatively easy I mean even if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.810" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">have a a rotten job in civilization the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.790" end="00:12:36.620" style="s2">number of hazards that have been taken</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:37.830" style="s2">care of on a day to day level is most of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.620" end="00:12:40.220" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.830" end="00:12:43.170" style="s2">they&#39;re more people for example who are</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.220" end="00:12:45.600" style="s2">obese than starving these days so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.170" end="00:12:50.370" style="s2">greatest hazard that ancestors would</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.600" end="00:12:52.380" style="s2">have faced has apparently been taken out</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.370" end="00:12:54.839" style="s2">of first place starvation is not an</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.380" end="00:12:56.940" style="s2">issue at the moment but what that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.839" end="00:12:59.430" style="s2">is that somatically we&#39;re getting the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.940" end="00:13:03.269" style="s2">wrong messages about how secure we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.430" end="00:13:05.970" style="s2">that our day-to-day lives aren&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.269" end="00:13:09.450" style="s2">difficult but our long-term prospects</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.970" end="00:13:11.610" style="s2">are actually not so hot so effectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.450" end="00:13:15.510" style="s2">we have to address this puzzle we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:18.360" style="s2">to make civilization sustainable and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.510" end="00:13:20.540" style="s2">would argue that if you made it</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.360" end="00:13:23.790" style="s2">sustainable but you didn&#39;t make it fair</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.540" end="00:13:25.950" style="s2">it wouldn&#39;t stick so essentially we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.790" end="00:13:27.500" style="s2">faced with the puzzle of either finally</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.950" end="00:13:31.769" style="s2">addressing all of these puzzles together</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.500" end="00:13:33.630" style="s2">or building something that might reduce</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.769" end="00:13:36.329" style="s2">jeopardy of one kind or another but</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.630" end="00:13:38.070" style="s2">would only last temporarily so how can</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.329" end="00:13:39.350" style="s2">you convince people that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.070" end="00:13:41.329" style="s2">sustainable</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.350" end="00:13:43.220" style="s2">because people are kind of programmed to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.329" end="00:13:45.130" style="s2">think about how good they have it I</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.220" end="00:13:48.829" style="s2">think this may be the greatest challenge</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.130" end="00:13:51.850" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got is that as long as people</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.829" end="00:13:56.120" style="s2">are well-fed they don&#39;t tend to believe</p>

<p begin="00:13:56.120" end="00:14:02.690" style="s2">tell us very well that we are burning up</p>

<p begin="00:14:06.250" end="00:14:14.770" style="s2">one reason for hope is that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.110" end="00:14:17.470" style="s2">may be closing in on viable fusion power</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.470" end="00:14:24.550" style="s2">power could potentially plug into all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.590" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">our systems and allow us lots of leeway</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.550" end="00:14:29.530" style="s2">to do remarkable things including</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:31.720" style="s2">reverse global warming if we can scale</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.530" end="00:14:33.610" style="s2">it up it sucked the heat out of the air</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.720" end="00:14:36.040" style="s2">not suck the heat out but suck the</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.610" end="00:14:38.710" style="s2">carbon out of the atmosphere so fusion</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.040" end="00:14:43.210" style="s2">power offers a great deal of hope but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.710" end="00:14:45.820" style="s2">we deploy it without figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.210" end="00:14:48.370" style="s2">other puzzles then we run the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.820" end="00:14:50.860" style="s2">just amplifying and Justices in the</p>

<p begin="00:15:05.050" end="00:15:13.740" style="s2">and because we&#39;ve both seen how fairness</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.620" end="00:15:17.260" style="s2">can be used abusively yeah so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.740" end="00:15:20.350" style="s2">accurately gauge that well this is one</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.260" end="00:15:23.710" style="s2">of these places where there is room for</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.350" end="00:15:27.190" style="s2">reasonable people to disagree over let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.710" end="00:15:29.260" style="s2">say how unequal outcomes can be and</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.190" end="00:15:30.940" style="s2">still be tolerated but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.260" end="00:15:32.920" style="s2">there&#39;s any room for reasonable people</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.940" end="00:15:36.580" style="s2">to disagree both</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.920" end="00:15:38.980" style="s2">the distribution of opportunity that all</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.580" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">of us if we are honest brokers who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.980" end="00:15:44.050" style="s2">interested in the well-being of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:47.170" style="s2">entire population should be interested</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.050" end="00:15:49.830" style="s2">in seeing opportunity as broadly</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.170" end="00:15:52.630" style="s2">distributed as possible and we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.830" end="00:15:55.510" style="s2">easily detect that opportunity is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.630" end="00:15:57.970" style="s2">evenly distributed because schools</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.510" end="00:16:00.370" style="s2">different quality because zip codes</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.970" end="00:16:03.880" style="s2">differ in the degree to which they</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.370" end="00:16:06.160" style="s2">prepare you for adult life so once we</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.880" end="00:16:08.620" style="s2">get close to fairness it will be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.160" end="00:16:11.380" style="s2">harder to answer that question but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.620" end="00:16:13.510" style="s2">think we have far enough to go that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.380" end="00:16:16.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not so difficult isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.510" end="00:16:19.210" style="s2">arriving at fairness in a sense a</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.270" end="00:16:21.520" style="s2">redistribution of advantage not</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.210" end="00:16:23.110" style="s2">necessarily wealth but advantage like</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.520" end="00:16:24.640" style="s2">there will be losers because there are</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.110" end="00:16:26.520" style="s2">winners now in the system or can you</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.640" end="00:16:28.230" style="s2">convince people that everybody&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.520" end="00:16:31.810" style="s2">be a winner</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.230" end="00:16:34.840" style="s2">well that&#39;s why I like this formulation</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.810" end="00:16:37.270" style="s2">the fact is I believe that an adult</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.840" end="00:16:39.250" style="s2">perspective has to recognize that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.270" end="00:16:42.040" style="s2">will have differences in outcome based</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.250" end="00:16:44.650" style="s2">on how dedicated individuals are some</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.040" end="00:16:46.750" style="s2">people may prefer to go spend time on</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.650" end="00:16:49.000" style="s2">the beach and be willing to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.750" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">smaller house to do so and I frankly</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.000" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">couldn&#39;t tell them that they were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:57.480" style="s2">to make that choice that&#39;s a valid set</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:17:02.490" style="s2">of priorities on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.480" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">opportunity has been hoarded by certain</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.490" end="00:17:09.610" style="s2">populations and it does so for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:11.140" style="s2">which is to say it is rational to keep</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.610" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">other children from having the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.140" end="00:17:15.430" style="s2">advantages that your children have that</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:25.680" style="s2">understand the desire to do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.480" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">rational it&#39;s immoral but it&#39;s rational</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.680" end="00:17:31.710" style="s2">what I cannot abide is anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:33.720" style="s2">argues that it is defensible to deny</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.710" end="00:17:36.360" style="s2">some people opportunity and then hold</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.720" end="00:17:38.310" style="s2">them responsible for the outcomes in</p>

<p begin="00:17:40.290" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">accountable for the outcomes in our</p>

<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:48.270" style="s2">opportunity in which case we have a</p>

<p begin="00:17:48.270" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">opportunity to take care of them seems</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.520" end="00:17:54.570" style="s2">to me that you end up in one of those</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:57.780" style="s2">two places inevitably and I would far</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.570" end="00:18:00.030" style="s2">prefer to see people liberated to</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.780" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">produce great stuff to see them</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.030" end="00:18:05.820" style="s2">empowered to do it and then if some</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:07.230" style="s2">people want to take it as leisure time</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.820" end="00:18:08.700" style="s2">and other people want to dedicate</p>

<p begin="00:18:08.700" end="00:18:12.300" style="s2">to they&#39;re willing to endure the</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:15.690" style="s2">consequence of living in very different</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.300" end="00:18:16.560" style="s2">circumstances that&#39;s fine by me well but</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.690" end="00:18:19.710" style="s2">then their children</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.560" end="00:18:21.540" style="s2">Goldin suffer their choices and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.710" end="00:18:23.880" style="s2">there will eventually be unfairness</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.540" end="00:18:25.980" style="s2">again in the system there can be but</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.880" end="00:18:29.160" style="s2">what I don&#39;t want to see is a you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.980" end="00:18:32.760" style="s2">yes if your parents decided to recover</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.160" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">the fraction of Civilizations surplus</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:02.500" style="s2">like every generation every new life is</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.830" end="00:19:04.630" style="s2">given a fair shake that seems</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.500" end="00:19:07.809" style="s2">preposterous at one level but when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.630" end="00:19:10.690" style="s2">think about the vast fortunes that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.809" end="00:19:12.790" style="s2">spend on frivolous stuff it doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.690" end="00:19:15.160" style="s2">so far out of range but we spend a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.790" end="00:19:19.120" style="s2">hundred and twenty billion dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.160" end="00:19:21.550" style="s2">year on text messages a hundred and</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.170" end="00:19:46.450" style="s2">something like fifteen hundred dollars</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.460" end="00:19:56.980" style="s2">makes no sense to us at all but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.920" end="00:19:59.730" style="s2">point is because it&#39;s a small part of</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.730" end="00:20:05.260" style="s2">expenditure so my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.980" end="00:20:07.780" style="s2">if you took things that are really not</p>

<p begin="00:20:07.780" end="00:20:12.010" style="s2">productive and you repurposed a small</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.830" end="00:20:35.410" style="s2">something different why would we ever</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.530" end="00:21:58.290" style="s2">the porn industry yeah right and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.080" end="00:22:00.550" style="s2">it&#39;s an impossible puzzle to solve but</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.290" end="00:22:01.990" style="s2">the point I want to make it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.550" end="00:22:06.070" style="s2">text messages being the source of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.990" end="00:22:09.370" style="s2">revenue to solve the problem of failing</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.070" end="00:22:11.650" style="s2">schools my point is do you realize how</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.370" end="00:22:13.970" style="s2">many activities that are almost totally</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.650" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">frivolous we invest you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.970" end="00:22:18.650" style="s2">huge sums of money in and my point is</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.570" style="s2">not that some particular thing is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.650" end="00:22:24.220" style="s2">place to recover that revenue my point</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.570" end="00:22:26.660" style="s2">is we have a system that generates</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.220" end="00:22:30.200" style="s2">absolutely immense abundance and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.660" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">wastes it and my point would be you</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.200" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">could take some of that abundance and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:35.030" style="s2">you could turn it into opportunity for</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:37.270" style="s2">people who are trapped in a system</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.030" end="00:22:40.700" style="s2">that&#39;s going to keep them perpetually</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.270" end="00:22:42.980" style="s2">hobbled and then hold them responsible</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.700" end="00:22:45.080" style="s2">for hey did you make use of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.980" end="00:22:46.760" style="s2">opportunity or didn&#39;t you if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.080" end="00:22:48.590" style="s2">good opportunity and you squandered it I</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.760" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">think we can afford to be less</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.590" end="00:22:52.280" style="s2">sympathetic but if you didn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:55.010" style="s2">opportunity not being sympathetic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.280" end="00:22:57.470" style="s2">just simply inhumane well you were</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.010" end="00:22:59.390" style="s2">talking about earlier as suspending the</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.470" end="00:23:01.940" style="s2">policy argument and getting took some</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.390" end="00:23:04.520" style="s2">sort of foundational understanding so</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.940" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">that we can start to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.520" end="00:23:09.380" style="s2">tools that we need to solve these</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:12.110" style="s2">problems on a conceptual level or a</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.380" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">narrative level that would include some</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.110" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">sort of understanding of some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:18.230" style="s2">ethical understanding of human being</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:21.550" style="s2">some sort of sympathy synthetic</p>

<p begin="00:23:25.130" end="00:23:32.230" style="s2">that our ancestors found themselves in</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.230" end="00:23:36.290" style="s2">the experience of being an individual is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.670" end="00:23:38.930" style="s2">very compelling right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.290" end="00:23:41.810" style="s2">neurologically compelling but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.930" end="00:23:44.690" style="s2">actually an accident it&#39;s an accident of</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.810" end="00:23:47.540" style="s2">the fact that your ancestors didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.690" end="00:23:51.380" style="s2">the ability to affect things far from</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.540" end="00:23:54.380" style="s2">them or distant into the future and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.380" end="00:23:56.420" style="s2">you are focused on those things not that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.380" end="00:23:58.220" style="s2">are important but those things about</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.420" end="00:24:02.990" style="s2">which you have the potential to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.220" end="00:24:04.970" style="s2">useful interventions and so human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.990" end="00:24:06.620" style="s2">are focused on their individuality we</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.970" end="00:24:10.630" style="s2">should be focused on the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.620" end="00:24:14.060" style="s2">are hurtling around the Sun on a small</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.630" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">rock in which we are interconnected in</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.060" end="00:24:19.370" style="s2">ways that make us fragile and could deny</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:22.370" style="s2">potential future human beings from ever</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.370" end="00:24:23.270" style="s2">getting experienced to live here on</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.370" end="00:24:25.280" style="s2">earth and</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.270" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">to enjoy the fruits of our ancestors</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.280" end="00:24:31.160" style="s2">labor that&#39;s stupid we really you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:34.010" style="s2">it sounds trite but if you can just tune</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.160" end="00:24:37.610" style="s2">in just for a moment to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.010" end="00:24:41.540" style="s2">what unites us actually far exceeds what</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.610" end="00:24:43.840" style="s2">divides us and that we live in an era</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.540" end="00:24:48.440" style="s2">where our technological sophistication</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.840" end="00:24:52.160" style="s2">makes us capable of producing a surplus</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.440" end="00:24:55.700" style="s2">that could effectively free every person</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.160" end="00:24:58.880" style="s2">to live well and do useful stuff we need</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.700" end="00:25:02.060" style="s2">education to understand how powerful we</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.880" end="00:25:05.090" style="s2">are and that means that we can affect</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.060" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">the future and the space that we share</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.090" end="00:25:09.170" style="s2">much greater than our ancestors could</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:11.450" style="s2">absent and so we need to upgrade our</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.170" end="00:25:13.370" style="s2">understanding which would include like</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.450" end="00:25:16.370" style="s2">just a broadening of our awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.370" end="00:25:18.440" style="s2">how powerful we are we need to upgrade</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.370" end="00:25:20.150" style="s2">our software and the fact is upgrading</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.440" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">our software is something humans have</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.150" end="00:25:25.610" style="s2">done again and again and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:28.910" style="s2">can look at religious texts and you can</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.610" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">see them as upgrades sequential upgrades</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.910" end="00:25:33.890" style="s2">that increase what people are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">properly navigating and what we need</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.890" end="00:25:40.490" style="s2">essentially is the first upgrade that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:43.220" style="s2">aware of what it is that it is aware</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.490" end="00:25:45.560" style="s2">that what it is doing is changing our</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.220" end="00:25:47.270" style="s2">understanding of our own place in</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.560" end="00:25:49.430" style="s2">history and our responsibility to each</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.270" end="00:25:52.820" style="s2">other and in particular a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.430" end="00:25:54.500" style="s2">to future inhabitants of the planet that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.820" end="00:25:57.650" style="s2">we are both in a greater position to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.500" end="00:25:59.660" style="s2">damage their birthright and in a greater</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.650" end="00:26:03.100" style="s2">position to understand in what way we</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.660" end="00:26:04.970" style="s2">might protect it and that that carries</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.100" end="00:26:08.270" style="s2">responsibilities which is the downside</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.970" end="00:26:09.800" style="s2">but again the hardest part to compel</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.270" end="00:26:12.800" style="s2">people up but the one that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.800" end="00:26:14.780" style="s2">most important is were we to take that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.800" end="00:26:16.370" style="s2">project seriously we&#39;re we to look</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.780" end="00:26:18.380" style="s2">around the planet and say actually you</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.370" end="00:26:20.600" style="s2">know what I&#39;m wired to be suspicious of</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.380" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">people from other populations but once I</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.600" end="00:26:26.180" style="s2">get over that and once I see history for</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:27.920" style="s2">what it is and I see my own role for</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.180" end="00:26:30.650" style="s2">what it is that actually the project</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.920" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been handed that the living</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.650" end="00:26:34.970" style="s2">generations have been handed the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:35.660" style="s2">greatest project of all time the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.970" end="00:26:40.910" style="s2">route</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.660" end="00:26:44.180" style="s2">warding the most heroic exactly it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.910" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">heroic imagine for a second that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.180" end="00:26:50.120" style="s2">happen to be alive at the moment that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:51.820" style="s2">humanity is going to rise to some kind</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.120" end="00:26:55.060" style="s2">of collective consciousness and take</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.820" end="00:26:58.820" style="s2">responsibility for making the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.060" end="00:27:00.710" style="s2">really really good right now if a</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.820" end="00:27:02.840" style="s2">utopian said that you should be very</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.710" end="00:27:04.570" style="s2">frightened all right a utopian who</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.840" end="00:27:06.550" style="s2">speaks that way is in danger of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.570" end="00:27:08.690" style="s2">architecting something very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.550" end="00:27:11.210" style="s2">this is why I&#39;m saying it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.690" end="00:27:14.420" style="s2">important to stay away from utopian</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.210" end="00:27:16.810" style="s2">ideas at all costs I&#39;m not telling you I</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.420" end="00:27:18.920" style="s2">know how to take ownership of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.810" end="00:27:21.920" style="s2">responsibility for the future but I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.920" end="00:27:24.770" style="s2">know in what direction it is right that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.920" end="00:27:27.230" style="s2">that responsibility is the result of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.770" end="00:27:30.770" style="s2">process of discovery so what I get from</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.230" end="00:27:33.680" style="s2">you about utopia and why find it</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.770" end="00:27:36.950" style="s2">problematic is that it imagines an end</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.680" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">which is static and you want to put the</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.950" end="00:27:43.070" style="s2">focus on the process the the end isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.780" style="s2">the goal it the process is the go you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:27:44.780" end="00:27:49.220" style="s2">guess would be more evolutionary you see</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:51.170" style="s2">something as a dynamic that that will</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.220" end="00:27:52.390" style="s2">constantly need to be adjusted it will</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.390" end="00:27:58.430" style="s2">it must be enlightened what do you mean</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.210" end="00:28:11.770" style="s2">being maintained is not so difficult you</p>

<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:54.390" style="s2">prototype yeah on the other hand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.820" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">all doable right you the airplane isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.390" end="00:29:00.179" style="s2">infinitely complex it is complex enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:02.100" style="s2">to maintain the various feedback so that</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.179" end="00:29:05.040" style="s2">you never get on an airplane and you</p>

<p begin="00:29:05.040" end="00:29:09.380" style="s2">degrees doesn&#39;t happen if the Wright</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.049" end="00:29:12.660" style="s2">brothers had with their current</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.380" end="00:29:15.210" style="s2">understanding of technology or what they</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.660" end="00:29:17.700" style="s2">were trying to do locked their entire</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.210" end="00:29:19.380" style="s2">project and all future aircraft into</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.700" end="00:29:21.000" style="s2">this one conception that they had right</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.380" end="00:29:23.280" style="s2">there that would be kind of utopianism</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.000" end="00:29:25.740" style="s2">like we&#39;re gonna do this and damn</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.280" end="00:29:27.960" style="s2">reality this is what&#39;s gonna work but</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.740" end="00:29:29.640" style="s2">instead they&#39;re like okay what what we</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.960" end="00:29:31.169" style="s2">need to do right now is get this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.640" end="00:29:32.610" style="s2">off the ground that&#39;s all we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.169" end="00:29:34.440" style="s2">concentrate on just getting this thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.610" end="00:29:38.309" style="s2">off the ground and sending it a mile</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.440" end="00:29:40.970" style="s2">bingo okay bingo and I mean think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.309" end="00:29:43.799" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s the perfect example right</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.970" end="00:29:45.570" style="s2">1903 the Wright brothers finally get</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.799" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">enough stuff right to get off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.570" end="00:29:51.679" style="s2">long enough to say heavier-than-air</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:55.140" style="s2">flight has been accomplished in 1903</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.679" end="00:29:59.580" style="s2">1969 we land human beings on the moon</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.140" end="00:30:03.090" style="s2">they play golf and fly home okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.580" end="00:30:05.309" style="s2">a pretty short run from getting off the</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.090" end="00:30:07.710" style="s2">ground for 30 seconds to landing on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.309" end="00:30:09.270" style="s2">moon and playing golf yeah right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.710" end="00:30:12.419" style="s2">pretty short period of time and all that</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.270" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">stuff and everything that that was and</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.419" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">everything that was generated from that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:18.660" style="s2">was an inconceivable to the Wright</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:21.980" style="s2">brothers all that aluminum all that fuel</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.660" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">all all the different subsidiary yep</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.980" end="00:30:25.890" style="s2">technological advancements required just</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">to get this thing to keep on going</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.890" end="00:30:29.460" style="s2">forward they couldn&#39;t have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">coming on the other hand if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.460" end="00:30:32.490" style="s2">what they could see coming</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:35.309" style="s2">the Wright brothers were able to do an</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.490" end="00:30:36.960" style="s2">amazing amount between 1903 when they</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.309" end="00:30:40.140" style="s2">got off the ground for the first time in</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.960" end="00:30:42.860" style="s2">1909 for example all of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.140" end="00:30:44.940" style="s2">were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.860" end="00:30:46.980" style="s2">discover how to make heavier-than-air</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.940" end="00:30:49.650" style="s2">flight had the same set of problems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.980" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">solve and really it was a set of things</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.650" end="00:30:54.870" style="s2">you needed an engine powerful enough you</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:56.490" style="s2">needed the engine to be light enough you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.870" end="00:30:58.200" style="s2">know all of the powerful engines were</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.490" end="00:31:00.900" style="s2">heavy because it wasn&#39;t so hard if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.200" end="00:31:02.250" style="s2">had wheels under them to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.900" end="00:31:03.720" style="s2">weight of them so they needed to get the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.250" end="00:31:05.760" style="s2">engine light they need to get it</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.720" end="00:31:07.680" style="s2">efficient they needed to get the control</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.760" end="00:31:10.530" style="s2">of the aircraft good enough that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.680" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">didn&#39;t squander energy in turning and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.530" end="00:31:16.200" style="s2">staying stable and they needed the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:18.210" style="s2">airfoils to be aerodynamically efficient</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.200" end="00:31:19.230" style="s2">all of those things had to be right in</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.210" end="00:31:20.820" style="s2">order to get off the ground the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.230" end="00:31:23.010" style="s2">time once they got off the ground the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.820" end="00:31:24.900" style="s2">first time they knew more they were the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.010" end="00:31:26.700" style="s2">world&#39;s leading experts in aviation and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.900" end="00:31:28.170" style="s2">so having gotten off the ground the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.700" end="00:31:29.820" style="s2">first time it was clear what direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.170" end="00:31:32.010" style="s2">to head getting off the ground the first</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.820" end="00:31:34.470" style="s2">time required intuition about how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.010" end="00:31:35.820" style="s2">solve all of those little puzzles they</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.470" end="00:31:37.620" style="s2">had to make an engine that was light</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.820" end="00:31:39.000" style="s2">enough they had to get into fishing they</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.620" end="00:31:40.530" style="s2">had to get the control of the airplane</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.000" end="00:31:42.210" style="s2">down which they didn&#39;t have right at</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.530" end="00:31:44.610" style="s2">first they used this wing warping thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.210" end="00:31:48.150" style="s2">was pretty inefficient but the wind</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.610" end="00:31:51.420" style="s2">tunnel was designed so that they could</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.150" end="00:31:55.380" style="s2">see the cross-sections of wing that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.420" end="00:31:57.630" style="s2">most effective in the wind and they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.380" end="00:31:58.650" style="s2">in some sense I think it was luck I</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.630" end="00:32:00.450" style="s2">don&#39;t know that they knew that this</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.650" end="00:32:02.610" style="s2">would be the case some things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.450" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">scale there are lots of things that if</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.610" end="00:32:05.730" style="s2">you make a small version that works and</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:09.390" style="s2">then you just scale it up it&#39;ll fall</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.730" end="00:32:11.130" style="s2">apart bingo</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.390" end="00:32:13.430" style="s2">yes communism well there&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.130" end="00:32:17.850" style="s2">aviation example of this actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.430" end="00:32:19.480" style="s2">Langley&#39;s aerodrome so Langley is like a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.850" end="00:32:22.659" style="s2">battle like</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.480" end="00:32:25.750" style="s2">like a WWF battler see well Langley was</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.659" end="00:32:28.360" style="s2">a military guy and he was trying to win</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.750" end="00:32:32.110" style="s2">the competition to make heavier-than-air</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.360" end="00:32:33.850" style="s2">flight first and he had a toy called the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.110" end="00:32:35.320" style="s2">arrow drum that flew heavier than air</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.850" end="00:32:39.549" style="s2">flight but it didn&#39;t carry a person and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.320" end="00:32:41.710" style="s2">so anyway he scaled this toy up to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.549" end="00:32:44.559" style="s2">immense size and he invited the press so</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.710" end="00:32:47.559" style="s2">there&#39;s actually film of this and he</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.559" end="00:32:50.380" style="s2">launched it off this barge an elevated</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.559" end="00:32:53.200" style="s2">barge nothing launched off the barge and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.380" end="00:32:55.630" style="s2">literally crumbled into the sea right</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.200" end="00:32:57.100" style="s2">it&#39;s a very dramatic failure and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.630" end="00:33:00.730" style="s2">only thing that was wrong was that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.100" end="00:33:03.909" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize that he had a non</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.730" end="00:33:08.440" style="s2">scalable design that he would have had</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.909" end="00:33:11.799" style="s2">to modify it substantially so anyway the</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.440" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">Wright brothers were correct that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.799" end="00:33:16.120" style="s2">could check an airfoil at small size and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:17.980" style="s2">discover how it would function in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.120" end="00:33:19.870" style="s2">wind at large size yeah they also</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.980" end="00:33:21.700" style="s2">prototyped a lot of stuff at full size</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.870" end="00:33:24.269" style="s2">right so all of the practice that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.700" end="00:33:29.110" style="s2">did over several summers at Kitty Hawk</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.269" end="00:33:31.059" style="s2">involved full-size prototypes that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.110" end="00:33:32.380" style="s2">flew in the wind sometimes they flew</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.059" end="00:33:33.909" style="s2">them as kites then they flew them as</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.380" end="00:33:36.309" style="s2">gliders then ultimately they flew them</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.909" end="00:33:38.049" style="s2">as an airplane so they were doing work</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.309" end="00:33:39.789" style="s2">at full scale and they were doing work</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.049" end="00:33:42.639" style="s2">in miniature and the two things combined</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.789" end="00:33:44.950" style="s2">and beautifully the thing is about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.639" end="00:33:47.169" style="s2">society though that it&#39;s so complex that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.950" end="00:33:49.799" style="s2">there&#39;s not going to be any person</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.169" end="00:33:52.269" style="s2">that&#39;s going to understand even one</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.799" end="00:33:54.909" style="s2">whole of like the project that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.269" end="00:33:56.889" style="s2">working on like health care or any other</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.909" end="00:34:00.090" style="s2">Gooden thing how do you develop in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.889" end="00:34:06.299" style="s2">society trust across all these different</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.090" end="00:34:09.879" style="s2">expertise assists expertise ease it</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.299" end="00:34:12.089" style="s2">involves alignment and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.879" end="00:34:15.190" style="s2">problem that we face is that we are not</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.089" end="00:34:18.359" style="s2">we are not yet enough aligned to trust</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.190" end="00:34:18.359" style="s2">each other but</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.390" end="00:34:22.950" style="s2">there are I think we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.429" end="00:34:27.600" style="s2">borrow from ancient wisdom in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.950" end="00:34:30.110" style="s2">how to align ourselves but frankly what</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.600" end="00:34:32.639" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen in the last nine months</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.110" end="00:34:40.250" style="s2">suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.639" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">there is a hunger for people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.250" end="00:34:43.490" style="s2">authentic to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.740" end="00:34:51.510" style="s2">to attempt this job and what surprised</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.639" end="00:34:55.500" style="s2">me most is that many people who are</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.510" end="00:34:59.880" style="s2">quite aware that they don&#39;t agree with</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.500" end="00:35:01.860" style="s2">me politically are still listening</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.880" end="00:35:05.060" style="s2">because at some level I think they</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.860" end="00:35:05.060" style="s2">detect that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.490" end="00:35:11.010" style="s2">I mean really patriotism is the the core</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.970" end="00:35:13.350" style="s2">parameter that there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.010" end="00:35:15.660" style="s2">between listening to somebody who you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.350" end="00:35:17.700" style="s2">disagree with but who you believe is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.660" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">fundamentally rather ready to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.700" end="00:35:22.500" style="s2">for the same cause and therefore you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:25.020" style="s2">know that their disagreement is actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.500" end="00:35:28.170" style="s2">motivated not by a self-interest or</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.020" end="00:35:30.270" style="s2">something but by a difference in their</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.170" end="00:35:32.670" style="s2">understanding of how to achieve some</p>
