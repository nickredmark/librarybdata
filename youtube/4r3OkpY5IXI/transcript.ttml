<p begin="00:00:52.430" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">joe thank you so much for joining me man</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.079" end="00:00:58.770" style="s2">how are you doing jack thanks for having</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:00:59.820" style="s2">me I&#39;m doing pretty good and sorry had</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.770" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">to chase me for a couple months there</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.820" end="00:01:04.159" style="s2">been a while a couple of months you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:06.840" style="s2">obviously generally but also</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:08.760" style="s2">specifically in my case so yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.840" end="00:01:11.310" style="s2">yeah you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got young kids</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.760" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">and you&#39;ve got to get a fire on your</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.310" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">property and then there&#39;s the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">going on and so you&#39;re in high demand</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">and you got a lot of stuff going on so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:21.659" style="s2">thanks for taking the time to talk to us</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">I really appreciate it as I like to do I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.659" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">want to learn a little bit about you Joe</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:26.939" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve been exchanging on</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">Twitter for a while and frankly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.939" end="00:01:31.530" style="s2">even remember how we got connected but</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">there you were and there I was and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.530" end="00:01:35.790" style="s2">been on similar themes lately so this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2">an important talk for me and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.790" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">looking forward to it but to give people</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:41.369" style="s2">some context would you mind just giving</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.780" style="s2">a little bit of background like how did</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.369" end="00:01:44.700" style="s2">you get to where you are where are you</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.780" end="00:01:46.590" style="s2">what are you doing what&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.700" end="00:01:47.610" style="s2">of your origin story Joe I think people</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.590" end="00:01:52.290" style="s2">are gonna find it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.610" end="00:01:54.360" style="s2">sure so sorry I do have a baby crying in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.290" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">the backgrounds Servan on cue here I</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.360" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you can hear it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:02.070" style="s2">problem and this is life okay okay so</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:06.439" style="s2">let&#39;s see origin story so I kind of grew</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.070" end="00:02:08.399" style="s2">up around complex systems science my dad</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.439" end="00:02:10.349" style="s2">from what as long as I can remember</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.399" end="00:02:12.150" style="s2">that&#39;s what he did he did complex</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.349" end="00:02:13.410" style="s2">systems engineering so really taking the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.150" end="00:02:15.920" style="s2">lessons from complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.410" end="00:02:18.180" style="s2">science flying into engineering systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.920" end="00:02:20.070" style="s2">which turns out to be very very</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.180" end="00:02:22.620" style="s2">different from traditional systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.070" end="00:02:26.510" style="s2">engineering approaches and maybe we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.620" end="00:02:29.100" style="s2">end up talking about that but yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.510" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">that was something that I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.100" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">around and sort of gelled with my</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:37.380" style="s2">intuition about the world and so I ended</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:39.150" style="s2">up going to grad school for as you said</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.380" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">complexes with brain sciences down in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.150" end="00:02:45.660" style="s2">Boca Raton Florida where I the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">sciences part is fine and well that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.660" end="00:02:51.930" style="s2">really went for the complex systems so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">did so some fun research there but it</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.930" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">was very insulated sort of standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.880" style="s2">academia stuff so I want to get my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.980" style="s2">hands a little bit more dirty so it</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.880" end="00:03:04.400" style="s2">would it would is complex system science</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.980" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">what is complexity what is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.400" end="00:03:09.030" style="s2">sure so so you know we usually break</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">down the sciences into connie&#39;s fields</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.030" end="00:03:14.310" style="s2">you know like physics chemistry biology</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:15.900" style="s2">and typically they&#39;re broken up by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.310" end="00:03:18.090" style="s2">things the specific things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.900" end="00:03:20.130" style="s2">studying so biology is about study</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.090" end="00:03:22.670" style="s2">living systems organisms ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.130" end="00:03:26.520" style="s2">physics is about material systems</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.670" end="00:03:28.050" style="s2">chemistry is about chemicals complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.520" end="00:03:29.390" style="s2">systems science takes a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.050" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">different approach where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.390" end="00:03:33.900" style="s2">essentially agnostic to the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:36.780" style="s2">you&#39;re studying it&#39;s more interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.900" end="00:03:39.420" style="s2">the interactions between things the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.780" end="00:03:42.570" style="s2">organization of things and how the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.420" end="00:03:44.130" style="s2">properties of the systems that were</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.570" end="00:03:46.470" style="s2">interested in arise out of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.130" end="00:03:48.840" style="s2">interactions and the organization so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.470" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s less sort of essential you</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.840" end="00:03:53.430" style="s2">know I&#39;m studying biology because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:55.500" style="s2">studying organisms and and more well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.430" end="00:03:57.180" style="s2">studying biology because I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.500" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">the way systems are structured that our</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.180" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">living and what it is about that system</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:04.950" style="s2">structure that makes a living system say</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:07.260" style="s2">distinct from a nonliving system so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.950" end="00:04:11.100" style="s2">a shift it&#39;s a shift in perspective from</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.260" end="00:04:13.800" style="s2">from the stuff that things are made out</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.100" end="00:04:17.549" style="s2">of to the patterns that things embody</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.800" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">that they they generate they got it got</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.549" end="00:04:23.910" style="s2">it and and so like in this context what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">does complexity mean so complexity to</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.910" end="00:04:26.850" style="s2">tell you the truth that maybe not too</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:28.800" style="s2">surprising that is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.850" end="00:04:30.300" style="s2">because I mean there&#39;s like these ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.800" end="00:04:33.180" style="s2">of computational complexity which</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.300" end="00:04:35.370" style="s2">essentially means how long of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.180" end="00:04:38.850" style="s2">description do I need to describe a</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.370" end="00:04:40.140" style="s2">system so in that sense a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.850" end="00:04:42.210" style="s2">system is one that needs a very very</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.140" end="00:04:44.700" style="s2">long description a simple system needs a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.210" end="00:04:46.310" style="s2">very short description so you can think</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.700" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">of things like imagine a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.310" end="00:04:50.760" style="s2">stripes black and white stripes you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:52.830" style="s2">I could have an infinite series of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.760" end="00:04:54.870" style="s2">stripes but I could describe it very</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.830" end="00:04:56.490" style="s2">briefly I say you know four bars of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.870" end="00:04:58.200" style="s2">white four bars of black four bars of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.490" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">white continue on forever that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.200" end="00:05:02.040" style="s2">thing so that&#39;s sort of a compressible</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:04.680" style="s2">descriptions that&#39;s not very complex in</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.040" end="00:05:08.040" style="s2">terms of computational complexity system</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.680" end="00:05:10.830" style="s2">but but more sort of colloquially and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.040" end="00:05:15.870" style="s2">sort of less formally it also has to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.830" end="00:05:19.190" style="s2">with how how interdependent the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.870" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">the system are how much the behavior or</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.190" end="00:05:23.640" style="s2">the exposure of a part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:27.990" style="s2">sort of impacts other parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.640" end="00:05:31.380" style="s2">system okay so so you know you get hit</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.990" end="00:05:32.760" style="s2">and hit in the foot and you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.380" end="00:05:34.170" style="s2">feel it because it&#39;s traveling through</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.760" end="00:05:37.730" style="s2">your nervous system through your brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.170" end="00:05:40.200" style="s2">and you&#39;re having some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.730" end="00:05:42.990" style="s2">emotional and chemical and hormonal</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.200" end="00:05:44.640" style="s2">response to it maybe so so clearly your</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.990" end="00:05:46.920" style="s2">system your body is very interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.640" end="00:05:48.930" style="s2">all the parts depend on one another so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.920" end="00:05:52.320" style="s2">complexity can also refer to that kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.930" end="00:05:55.140" style="s2">of interdependency and would you say our</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.320" end="00:05:57.150" style="s2">world is becoming more or less more less</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.140" end="00:05:59.120" style="s2">complex oh that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.150" end="00:06:01.260" style="s2">question because it&#39;s clear that that</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.120" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">we&#39;re having more long range</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.260" end="00:06:06.420" style="s2">interactions all the time but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:08.370" style="s2">coupled with that we&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.420" end="00:06:11.190" style="s2">decrease in short range interactions</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.370" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">because we sort of as as individual</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.190" end="00:06:14.970" style="s2">units we have a bandwidth we can have</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:16.110" style="s2">you know how many interactions add a 100</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.970" end="00:06:18.330" style="s2">interactions a day or something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.110" end="00:06:20.730" style="s2">that so where are we spreading those so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.330" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">so at a global scale we&#39;re becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.730" end="00:06:24.450" style="s2">interconnected and local scales are</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:27.900" style="s2">becoming in a lot of ways more</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.450" end="00:06:30.180" style="s2">disconnected and then you have the issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.900" end="00:06:31.740" style="s2">of when you have these large scale</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.180" end="00:06:34.800" style="s2">events say like a pandemic like corona</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.740" end="00:06:36.330" style="s2">virus pandemic whatever in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.800" end="00:06:38.490" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a very simple event</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.330" end="00:06:40.260" style="s2">because it&#39;s one thing happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.490" end="00:06:42.660" style="s2">everywhere you know if you return to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.260" end="00:06:44.190" style="s2">computational complexity you know all I</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.660" end="00:06:46.980" style="s2">need to describe is well there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.190" end="00:06:48.960" style="s2">virus and it&#39;s you know this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.980" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">obviously not quite true but it&#39;s evenly</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.960" end="00:06:54.510" style="s2">spread across the planet and you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:57.720" style="s2">it&#39;s 50% of the people got it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.510" end="00:06:59.250" style="s2">so it&#39;s interesting because the</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.720" end="00:07:01.260" style="s2">interconnections and the interactions</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.250" end="00:07:03.780" style="s2">can lead to very what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.260" end="00:07:06.510" style="s2">coherent behavior which is simple in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.780" end="00:07:08.550" style="s2">sense but it&#39;s a a kind of pathological</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.510" end="00:07:11.160" style="s2">simplicity arising out of that that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.550" end="00:07:12.660" style="s2">interconnected this interesting I guess</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.160" end="00:07:14.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like bringing everything into</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.660" end="00:07:17.640" style="s2">correlation these kind of events huh</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.760" end="00:07:19.530" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right so so when</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.640" end="00:07:21.030" style="s2">everything gets correlated you know you</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.530" end="00:07:23.610" style="s2">might all grow up together but then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.030" end="00:07:25.290" style="s2">all go down together - yeah and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.610" end="00:07:27.470" style="s2">bitch for people that study portfolio</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.290" end="00:07:30.300" style="s2">theory and want to develop</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.470" end="00:07:32.130" style="s2">non-correlated trades and sort of reduce</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.300" end="00:07:34.380" style="s2">systemic risk in their portfolio but</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.130" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">oopsy-daisy there&#39;s incidents in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.380" end="00:07:37.350" style="s2">everything is correlated and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:38.910" style="s2">absolutely nothing you can do you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.350" end="00:07:41.820" style="s2">something about that kind of work don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.910" end="00:07:45.030" style="s2">ya yeah sure so that&#39;s exactly right so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.820" end="00:07:46.680" style="s2">so and you know you look over some</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.030" end="00:07:48.480" style="s2">sample period and you convince yourself</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.680" end="00:07:49.800" style="s2">you know these two things are</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.480" end="00:07:52.140" style="s2">independent from one another but then</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.800" end="00:07:53.430" style="s2">some much larger event comes out and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.140" end="00:07:55.260" style="s2">get into order you know where knows the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.430" end="00:07:57.060" style="s2">tails of the distribution the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.260" end="00:07:59.900" style="s2">events and all of a sudden everything is</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.060" end="00:08:04.590" style="s2">moving together so so it actually takes</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.900" end="00:08:06.420" style="s2">an obscene amount of data to look for</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.590" end="00:08:08.760" style="s2">those things that are really either</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.420" end="00:08:11.040" style="s2">correlated or they have a more generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.760" end="00:08:12.150" style="s2">a tail Association so maybe when things</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.040" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">are kind of normal they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.150" end="00:08:17.070" style="s2">fairly independent seeming but then when</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:19.470" style="s2">things go wrong there they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.070" end="00:08:21.210" style="s2">failing together and this work that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.470" end="00:08:22.830" style="s2">you&#39;ve done it&#39;s brought you in contact</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.210" end="00:08:24.570" style="s2">with some interesting folks and some</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.830" end="00:08:26.880" style="s2">people that folks may know about you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.570" end="00:08:28.680" style="s2">done some good work with Nassim Taleb in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.880" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">fact I was under the impression that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.680" end="00:08:31.440" style="s2">had only done some recent papers with</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">him but I went back and looked and their</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.440" end="00:08:35.099" style="s2">stuff from from years ago</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:36.960" style="s2">tell me how you came to that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.099" end="00:08:39.660" style="s2">relationship and some of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.960" end="00:08:41.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve been doing with him sure so I met</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.660" end="00:08:43.560" style="s2">in the scene when I did a postdoc at the</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.880" end="00:08:46.050" style="s2">New England complex systems Institute up</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.560" end="00:08:48.090" style="s2">in Cambridge Mass he already had a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.050" end="00:08:50.340" style="s2">relationship with you near Bari am who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.090" end="00:08:54.010" style="s2">the president there I came in his</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.340" end="00:08:56.960" style="s2">postdoc I was already a fan of the seams</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.010" end="00:08:58.550" style="s2">primarily I&#39;d read a few books but anti</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.960" end="00:09:02.300" style="s2">fragile was the one that I read that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.550" end="00:09:04.490" style="s2">really hit me and so I took the</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.300" end="00:09:07.630" style="s2">opportunity when I saw that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.490" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">to kind of stick my nose into it and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.630" end="00:09:15.500" style="s2"> right so so you know how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:18.920" style="s2">and your love that yeah so so I started</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.500" end="00:09:20.300" style="s2">working on a paper and a theme of papers</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.920" end="00:09:22.670" style="s2">we&#39;ve had several releases around the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.300" end="00:09:25.730" style="s2">same topic of the precautionary</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.670" end="00:09:28.060" style="s2">principle where the idea is there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.730" end="00:09:31.100" style="s2">certain kinds of risks that at a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.060" end="00:09:34.970" style="s2">societal scale are not worth taking</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.100" end="00:09:36.770" style="s2">despite their potential benefits because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.970" end="00:09:39.020" style="s2">the the downside to if something was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.770" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">wrong is so catastrophic that they just</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.020" end="00:09:43.220" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a failure of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:49.070" style="s2">cost-benefit analysis with that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.220" end="00:09:50.960" style="s2">infinite downside yeah the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.070" end="00:09:53.330" style="s2">downside and I read somewhere you had</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.960" end="00:09:55.550" style="s2">written a quote about the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.330" end="00:09:57.830" style="s2">death cascade of our current system</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.550" end="00:10:00.470" style="s2">which is something that that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.830" end="00:10:02.390" style="s2">talk about and I think it&#39;s a theme of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.470" end="00:10:05.270" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got going on but just to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.390" end="00:10:08.240" style="s2">finish the thread here with Nasim you</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.270" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">guys did a paper in what January or so</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.240" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">of this year talking about the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:15.850" style="s2">and you guys were way ahead of the curve</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:17.750" style="s2">in terms of sort of popular</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.850" end="00:10:20.210" style="s2">understanding of what was gonna happen</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.750" end="00:10:21.770" style="s2">and what&#39;s currently happening and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.210" end="00:10:23.450" style="s2">trying to stay a little bit away from</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.770" end="00:10:25.760" style="s2">corona talk just so these conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.450" end="00:10:29.420" style="s2">have a little bit more evergreen nature</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:30.560" style="s2">to them but I am curious to what was</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.420" end="00:10:32.390" style="s2">what was sort of like the pre</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.560" end="00:10:34.400" style="s2">conversations like how did you guys</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.390" end="00:10:36.950" style="s2">decide to write that paper at that time</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.400" end="00:10:39.680" style="s2">what were you seeing and did anybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.950" end="00:10:42.500" style="s2">listen to you and what do you think is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.680" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">is coming still yeah so so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.500" end="00:10:46.220" style="s2">interesting and the idea of I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:47.690" style="s2">want to get too bogged down and talking</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.220" end="00:10:50.420" style="s2">specifically about coronavirus either</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.690" end="00:10:54.709" style="s2">but actually this issue of pandemic is</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:57.170" style="s2">unfortunately likely evergreen true true</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.709" end="00:10:58.670" style="s2">so that&#39;s an unfortunate reality it</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.170" end="00:10:59.990" style="s2">comes from what we&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.670" end="00:11:02.570" style="s2">we have these all these long range</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.990" end="00:11:04.850" style="s2">connections now so things just spread</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.570" end="00:11:06.860" style="s2">very easily so they&#39;re coming so yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.850" end="00:11:09.350" style="s2">really said in late January</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.860" end="00:11:12.470" style="s2">you know wrote it over weekend saw what</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.350" end="00:11:14.590" style="s2">was no thanks to Twitter essentially</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.470" end="00:11:17.060" style="s2">social media but Twitter specifically</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.590" end="00:11:22.190" style="s2">saw the videos coming out of China so it</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.060" end="00:11:24.320" style="s2">was going on the for me the big data</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.190" end="00:11:26.450" style="s2">point was when they started walking down</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.320" end="00:11:28.970" style="s2">first they locked down Wu Han which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.450" end="00:11:31.160" style="s2">like eleven million people right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.970" end="00:11:33.070" style="s2">I I don&#39;t want to get overly sir</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.160" end="00:11:36.950" style="s2">geopolitical here but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.070" end="00:11:39.230" style="s2">the CCP is too too interested in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.950" end="00:11:41.270" style="s2">kind of welfare of individuals so for</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.230" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">them to do that that says that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.270" end="00:11:47.450" style="s2">looked and saw that their nation their</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:49.070" style="s2">government was at risk right but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.450" end="00:11:53.090" style="s2">that was a big data point for me and</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.070" end="00:11:55.250" style="s2">it&#39;s actually more more of an important</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.090" end="00:11:57.110" style="s2">data point than some kind of specific</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.250" end="00:11:58.400" style="s2">viral parameters that you that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.110" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">necessarily is going to take you a long</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.400" end="00:12:05.690" style="s2">time to figure out track down studying</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:09.170" style="s2">all that so I talked to the seem about</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.690" end="00:12:14.020" style="s2">it I talked to a friend will go unnamed</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.170" end="00:12:15.830" style="s2">down in DC about it friend said hey look</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.020" end="00:12:17.270" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is making a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.830" end="00:12:18.710" style="s2">sense and I don&#39;t see anyone saying it</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.270" end="00:12:20.360" style="s2">so if you have a paper or something you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.710" end="00:12:22.130" style="s2">can point to that would be awesome I</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.360" end="00:12:24.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a page of paper I can point</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.130" end="00:12:26.330" style="s2">to so we wrote it Wow</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.050" end="00:12:28.250" style="s2">the big thing is in this connects to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.330" end="00:12:30.830" style="s2">precautionary principle the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.250" end="00:12:32.120" style="s2">that recognize is that in this expect</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.830" end="00:12:35.100" style="s2">went back to how we think about things</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.120" end="00:12:37.620" style="s2">in terms of complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.100" end="00:12:39.690" style="s2">it&#39;s not not all systems are the same</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.620" end="00:12:42.740" style="s2">but subsystems you can compare in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.690" end="00:12:45.150" style="s2">of the way they generate their behavior</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.740" end="00:12:49.940" style="s2">contagion so viral contagion in this</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.150" end="00:12:52.050" style="s2">case it&#39;s kind of the prototypical</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.940" end="00:12:53.850" style="s2">multiplicative dynamic so that means</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.050" end="00:12:56.640" style="s2">that you know you have one person sick</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.850" end="00:12:57.750" style="s2">they get two people sick they get four</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.640" end="00:12:59.910" style="s2">people six and that&#39;s where we get</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.750" end="00:13:02.670" style="s2">talking about this exponential kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.910" end="00:13:06.180" style="s2">growth that comes out of the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.670" end="00:13:14.340" style="s2">multiplicative dynamic and there is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.180" end="00:13:15.740" style="s2">a huge chasm between systems that do and</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.340" end="00:13:18.150" style="s2">don&#39;t have that multiplicative property</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.740" end="00:13:19.860" style="s2">and when they do have that property that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.150" end="00:13:22.130" style="s2">means that they can become systemic when</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.860" end="00:13:24.150" style="s2">the system is interconnected very easily</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.130" end="00:13:25.350" style="s2">so you can think of something like you</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.150" end="00:13:27.180" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of comparisons for</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.350" end="00:13:29.490" style="s2">instance to car accidents like well you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.180" end="00:13:30.510" style="s2">know only five Americans died so far and</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.490" end="00:13:33.630" style="s2">look how many people are dying in car</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.510" end="00:13:36.180" style="s2">accidents the thing is car accidents at</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.630" end="00:13:39.840" style="s2">a macro scale are not contagious if I</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.180" end="00:13:43.110" style="s2">crash my car into treaty or even into a</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.840" end="00:13:45.150" style="s2">person up here in New Hampshire there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.110" end="00:13:48.090" style="s2">not going to be any causal chain of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.150" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">events that&#39;s connecting directly some</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.090" end="00:13:53.610" style="s2">some car accident in DC but with viral</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:56.790" style="s2">contagion you indeed have those</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.610" end="00:14:00.450" style="s2">connections so it&#39;s a bit like a forest</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.790" end="00:14:02.100" style="s2">fire where fire spreads grows the</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.450" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">difference is the forest tends to stay</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.100" end="00:14:06.960" style="s2">in place but people are up moving around</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:09.110" style="s2">so the multiplicative dynamics just are</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.960" end="00:14:13.050" style="s2">that much more exacerbated though the</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.110" end="00:14:16.920" style="s2">air travel and all that so that&#39;s so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.050" end="00:14:19.250" style="s2">saw that and the the reason to write the</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.920" end="00:14:22.860" style="s2">paper was actually not because</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.250" end="00:14:24.750" style="s2">coronavirus specifically we had any</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.860" end="00:14:26.850" style="s2">certainty that this is a going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.750" end="00:14:31.740" style="s2">devastating problem the specific virus</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.850" end="00:14:33.930" style="s2">but the logic is that because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.740" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">know how bad it&#39;s going to be coupled</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.930" end="00:14:39.480" style="s2">with the fact that its multiplicative</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:40.650" style="s2">and therefore systemic then you need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.480" end="00:14:44.460" style="s2">take precautionary actions immediately</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.650" end="00:14:47.440" style="s2">and if you&#39;re wrong then you spend some</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.460" end="00:14:50.110" style="s2">extra money some extra energy in</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.440" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">you know an overkill quote-unquote kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.110" end="00:14:56.980" style="s2">of solution and if you&#39;re right thank</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:58.959" style="s2">God right whereas you know if you take</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.980" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">the other side of the bed you know I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.959" end="00:15:03.190" style="s2">probably be fine then even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:05.529" style="s2">right in the case of say for rotavirus</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.190" end="00:15:07.630" style="s2">or any specific instance when you start</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.529" end="00:15:10.769" style="s2">to stack up those probabilities because</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.630" end="00:15:14.110" style="s2">because that logic justifies its own</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.769" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">reuse right like yeah it&#39;s probably fine</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.110" end="00:15:16.540" style="s2">so what about the next time one comes</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:18.640" style="s2">around that&#39;s probably fine - it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.540" end="00:15:20.769" style="s2">fine last time so eventually there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.640" end="00:15:22.750" style="s2">probably stack up or you get a guarantee</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.769" end="00:15:24.700" style="s2">that one of these things is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.750" end="00:15:26.050" style="s2">absolutely devastating and we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.700" end="00:15:28.540" style="s2">be behind the eight-ball on it we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.050" end="00:15:30.100" style="s2">gonna be ahead of it and unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.540" end="00:15:33.820" style="s2">you know that&#39;s kind of where we are</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.100" end="00:15:36.430" style="s2">headed we sort of we did these goofy</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.820" end="00:15:41.730" style="s2">ain&#39;t was lock downs and all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.430" end="00:15:44.230" style="s2">and it became politically polarized and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.730" end="00:15:46.950" style="s2">you know it doesn&#39;t seem like as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.230" end="00:15:50.410" style="s2">society we learned much of anything yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.950" end="00:15:52.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s been tough because the</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.410" end="00:15:55.899" style="s2">messaging hasn&#39;t been perfectly clear</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.360" end="00:15:58.690" style="s2">the fruits of people sacrifice hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.899" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">been exactly clear to folks and then you</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.690" end="00:16:05.200" style="s2">add on at the end this political mess</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:07.870" style="s2">where public health officials who just</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.200" end="00:16:09.760" style="s2">yesterday we&#39;re saying everybody needs</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.870" end="00:16:11.890" style="s2">to stay home no weddings no sporting</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.760" end="00:16:16.390" style="s2">events no graduations no marriages no</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.890" end="00:16:19.510" style="s2">church no services no funerals one day</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.390" end="00:16:21.010" style="s2">next day if you want to protest</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.510" end="00:16:22.120" style="s2">something that you believe is an</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.010" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">important political issue</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.120" end="00:16:25.480" style="s2">go right ahead hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.329" style="s2">people all in the street let&#39;s have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.480" end="00:16:30.370" style="s2">street party and that part I think is</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.329" end="00:16:33.520" style="s2">going to do some long-term damage to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.370" end="00:16:36.279" style="s2">as a society because our faith in public</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.520" end="00:16:38.529" style="s2">health officials and epidemiologists has</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.279" end="00:16:43.269" style="s2">been diminished we we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen just</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.529" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">some totally just wanton pilatus eight</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.269" end="00:16:48.459" style="s2">how politician of this event and like</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:51.310" style="s2">discarding something that was told to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.459" end="00:16:53.110" style="s2">as life or death it&#39;s life or death but</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.310" end="00:16:54.940" style="s2">if you have a political issue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.110" end="00:16:57.130" style="s2">based on some people would say very</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.940" end="00:16:59.529" style="s2">flimsy statistics and it&#39;s probably made</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.130" end="00:17:00.640" style="s2">up and has not as much relevance as you</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.529" end="00:17:02.980" style="s2">would think hey go right</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.640" end="00:17:04.690" style="s2">ahead and just protest and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.980" end="00:17:07.030" style="s2">gonna be damaging and especially when</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.690" end="00:17:09.190" style="s2">you talk about how the logic becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.030" end="00:17:10.690" style="s2">reinforcing well you know maybe we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.190" end="00:17:12.220" style="s2">need to do this next time don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.690" end="00:17:13.839" style="s2">do this next time and what do you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.220" end="00:17:15.220" style="s2">news out of Beijing today is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.839" end="00:17:19.839" style="s2">they&#39;ve closed all the school systems</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.220" end="00:17:21.880" style="s2">cancelled inter intra sort of intra of</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.839" end="00:17:24.610" style="s2">our travel and they appear to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.880" end="00:17:25.780" style="s2">freaking out over a resurgence and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.610" end="00:17:28.800" style="s2">think even they might have said a</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.780" end="00:17:31.420" style="s2">different kind of strange so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.800" end="00:17:33.250" style="s2">the I&#39;ve been telling people were like</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.420" end="00:17:35.290" style="s2">barely in the third or fourth inning of</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.250" end="00:17:37.480" style="s2">this thing and it&#39;s gonna go on for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.290" end="00:17:39.430" style="s2">rest of the year complicated by politics</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.480" end="00:17:42.340" style="s2">complicated by elections of protests and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.430" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">rallies and it&#39;s just kind of a mess do</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.340" end="00:17:49.270" style="s2">you feel like how would you compare our</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:51.550" style="s2">readiness we&#39;ve compared today versus</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.270" end="00:17:52.990" style="s2">January of 2020 for the for the</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.550" end="00:17:55.870" style="s2">remainder of this or for the next one</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.990" end="00:17:58.270" style="s2">that comes I mean I mean my worry is</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.870" end="00:18:00.160" style="s2">that like you said it&#39;s it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.270" end="00:18:02.200" style="s2">our readiness hasn&#39;t improved we might</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.160" end="00:18:03.820" style="s2">have even gotten worse yeah because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.200" end="00:18:07.420" style="s2">become this thing that&#39;s now when it</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.820" end="00:18:08.920" style="s2">first rolled in it was political they</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.420" end="00:18:11.350" style="s2">was made to be political but it was in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.920" end="00:18:13.630" style="s2">different way and now it&#39;s so pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.350" end="00:18:15.580" style="s2">that everyone sort of has their their</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.630" end="00:18:17.110" style="s2">position that they&#39;ve they have taken</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.580" end="00:18:19.480" style="s2">and they&#39;re gonna stand by it no matter</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.110" end="00:18:22.600" style="s2">what the empirical evidence seems to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.480" end="00:18:24.100" style="s2">suggest so I feel like we might even be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.600" end="00:18:26.020" style="s2">less ready maybe we&#39;d have more masks</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.100" end="00:18:28.780" style="s2">and it wouldn&#39;t lie to us about masks</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.020" end="00:18:30.040" style="s2">don&#39;t work or something but uh other</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.780" end="00:18:31.420" style="s2">than that yeah I think I think we might</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.040" end="00:18:33.100" style="s2">be even worse off you know you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.420" end="00:18:35.920" style="s2">only thing that maybe we&#39;re better off</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.100" end="00:18:37.300" style="s2">now is that people are a bit primed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.920" end="00:18:39.190" style="s2">shut down air travel</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.300" end="00:18:42.040" style="s2">Nega so one of your questions was did we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.190" end="00:18:44.980" style="s2">have influence and the the feedback that</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.040" end="00:18:48.910" style="s2">we received is that our paper was used</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.980" end="00:18:51.160" style="s2">to sort of back the decision to stop the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.910" end="00:18:52.870" style="s2">flights from China and that was the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.160" end="00:18:56.440" style="s2">absolute right decision at the time</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.870" end="00:19:00.670" style="s2">there were attacks saying oh it&#39;s racist</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.440" end="00:19:03.710" style="s2">xenophobic you know which is absolute</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.670" end="00:19:05.600" style="s2">insanity I mean if we can</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.710" end="00:19:07.580" style="s2">we can&#39;t stop a virus from being</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.580" end="00:19:11.960" style="s2">is considered racist xenophobic or</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.320" end="00:19:13.279" style="s2">somehow morally wrong then what can you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.960" end="00:19:14.870" style="s2">do what are you what are you be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.279" end="00:19:17.690" style="s2">do in your own interest and defense</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.870" end="00:19:21.620" style="s2">after that right right you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.690" end="00:19:23.960" style="s2">fascinating is that you complex science</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.620" end="00:19:26.779" style="s2">guys were ahead of the curve on this and</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.960" end="00:19:28.130" style="s2">then some of the more active social</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.779" end="00:19:30.169" style="s2">media guys you would call them</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.130" end="00:19:32.179" style="s2">right-wing maybe a former Mogga guys</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.169" end="00:19:34.370" style="s2">whatever new right social me you guys we</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.179" end="00:19:37.580" style="s2">were on top of this too and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.370" end="00:19:40.520" style="s2">it is partially due to our sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.580" end="00:19:43.730" style="s2">innate and instinctive feel with these</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.520" end="00:19:47.270" style="s2">complex systems and the spread of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.730" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">and memes through our network and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.270" end="00:19:50.360" style="s2">way that we&#39;re all connected all around</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:51.919" style="s2">the world so we could see because there</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.360" end="00:19:55.010" style="s2">parallels right there&#39;s parallels</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.919" end="00:19:56.840" style="s2">between information networks and actual</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.010" end="00:19:59.000" style="s2">physical networks and biological</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.840" end="00:20:00.350" style="s2">networks and natural networks there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.000" end="00:20:03.260" style="s2">there&#39;s a pair that&#39;s almost if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.350" end="00:20:05.000" style="s2">over it&#39;s all related to I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.260" end="00:20:07.250" style="s2">it all comes from the same place which</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.000" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to and so we had a sense you</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.250" end="00:20:10.130" style="s2">could just feel it and we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:12.679" style="s2">these things happening and seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.130" end="00:20:15.830" style="s2">spread of viruses whether they be actual</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.679" end="00:20:17.450" style="s2">or or informational and so we were kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.830" end="00:20:19.370" style="s2">of ahead of the curve and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.450" end="00:20:23.450" style="s2">interesting to see these parallels and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.370" end="00:20:25.730" style="s2">you know this the stage for this all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.450" end="00:20:27.140" style="s2">negative fallout from our what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.730" end="00:20:29.270" style="s2">calling indiscriminate connections</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.140" end="00:20:31.130" style="s2">whether it&#39;s through the WTO and world</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.270" end="00:20:33.559" style="s2">trade whether it&#39;s through the ever</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.130" end="00:20:34.909" style="s2">encroaching you know span of NATO into</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.559" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">places where we probably have no</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.909" end="00:20:39.700" style="s2">business being or social media or</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:43.309" style="s2">information technology connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.700" end="00:20:44.750" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen now the the risks involved in</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.309" end="00:20:46.820" style="s2">that and one of the things that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.750" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">been talking about just briefly with us</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.820" end="00:20:52.460" style="s2">is these things called long-range</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:54.740" style="s2">connections and that influences mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.460" end="00:20:56.390" style="s2">and viral spread can you talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.740" end="00:20:58.789" style="s2">a long-range connection is in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.390" end="00:21:00.200" style="s2">context of complex systems and then also</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.789" end="00:21:02.120" style="s2">related to your experience and</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.200" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">understanding of social media and why</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.120" end="00:21:06.110" style="s2">they&#39;re similar and related and why we</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:06.980" style="s2">need to be concerned about that yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.110" end="00:21:12.289" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.980" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">so one of the big kind of modeling</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.289" end="00:21:16.669" style="s2">paradigms that you use in complex</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:17.510" style="s2">systems often are networks so where</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.669" end="00:21:19.370" style="s2">networks are just</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.510" end="00:21:21.740" style="s2">nodes and connections between them</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.370" end="00:21:23.930" style="s2">basically little dots lines drawn</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.740" end="00:21:26.030" style="s2">between them very simple the reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.930" end="00:21:27.950" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s so common in system</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.030" end="00:21:29.240" style="s2">science is because of what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.950" end="00:21:32.420" style="s2">about before because you are so focused</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.240" end="00:21:33.770" style="s2">on the interactions among the parts so</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.420" end="00:21:36.440" style="s2">this becomes a super stripped down</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.770" end="00:21:40.220" style="s2">representation of parts and their</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.440" end="00:21:42.170" style="s2">connectedness or their interactions so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.220" end="00:21:44.540" style="s2">if we think about networks and then we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.170" end="00:21:47.030" style="s2">think about imagine just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.540" end="00:21:48.230" style="s2">physical Euclidean space as a network</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.030" end="00:21:48.500" style="s2">what kind of a network would that look</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.230" end="00:21:51.410" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.500" end="00:21:53.060" style="s2">well if we think of one dimension you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.410" end="00:21:54.410" style="s2">might imagine a chain of nodes each</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.060" end="00:21:57.500" style="s2">connected by a link to its neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.410" end="00:22:01.100" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the space that we came in</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.500" end="00:22:04.580" style="s2">to in this world that you know if I want</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.100" end="00:22:07.670" style="s2">to travel from from New England to DC</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.580" end="00:22:11.240" style="s2">then I have to go pasture through New</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.670" end="00:22:12.470" style="s2">York City it&#39;s in between them so you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.240" end="00:22:15.080" style="s2">know there&#39;s all these steps in between</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.470" end="00:22:17.420" style="s2">one spot and another on the network</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.080" end="00:22:19.970" style="s2">long-range connections are where you</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.420" end="00:22:23.030" style="s2">have one node in one place that gets a</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.970" end="00:22:24.440" style="s2">direct link across where doesn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.030" end="00:22:27.410" style="s2">traverse through these other nodes</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.440" end="00:22:29.660" style="s2">anymore to go a far distance that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.410" end="00:22:32.120" style="s2">quote-unquote long-range the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.660" end="00:22:34.540" style="s2">interesting thing about say you take</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.120" end="00:22:38.420" style="s2">this kind of spatial grid network and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.540" end="00:22:40.250" style="s2">you say well how far am i away from some</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.420" end="00:22:41.960" style="s2">spot way over on the grid and you&#39;re 1 2</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.250" end="00:22:43.730" style="s2">3 4 however many hops that takes you to</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.960" end="00:22:45.980" style="s2">get there when you start adding these</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.730" end="00:22:47.900" style="s2">longer-range connections in it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.980" end="00:22:49.820" style="s2">only bring those two points close</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.900" end="00:22:53.150" style="s2">together but it also brings their</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.820" end="00:22:57.590" style="s2">neighbors close together so very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.150" end="00:23:00.290" style="s2">you go through a where most nodes are</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.590" end="00:23:02.270" style="s2">really far away in this space from other</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.290" end="00:23:04.430" style="s2">nodes to just a few a handful of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.270" end="00:23:06.500" style="s2">long-range connections makes any two</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.430" end="00:23:08.120" style="s2">nodes only a handful of hops away so</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.500" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">this is like the six degrees of Kevin</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.120" end="00:23:11.780" style="s2">Bacon kind of idea it&#39;s like doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:13.790" style="s2">matter who you are you can be in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.780" end="00:23:15.950" style="s2">middle of the Congo somewhere you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.790" end="00:23:18.710" style="s2">only like six degrees away maximum from</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.950" end="00:23:22.730" style="s2">Kevin Bacon no and and so so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.710" end="00:23:26.800" style="s2">the the intuition that thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.730" end="00:23:26.800" style="s2">this this way can build is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.049" end="00:23:30.409" style="s2">transition from everything being far</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.090" end="00:23:33.529" style="s2">apart to everything being really close</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.409" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">together happens very rapidly when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.529" end="00:23:37.759" style="s2">start adding these connections in and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:40.820" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s we&#39;ve already passed that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.759" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">globally like you&#39;re two hops away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.820" end="00:23:45.919" style="s2">most people you know you can get on a</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">plane and be anywhere and so effectively</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.919" end="00:23:52.970" style="s2">that kind of shrinks space into a much</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">smaller package and anything that does</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.970" end="00:23:57.049" style="s2">have that kind of spreading quality that</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:23:59.720" style="s2">cascading quality just goes through the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.049" end="00:24:01.730" style="s2">entire system I mean instantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.720" end="00:24:04.129" style="s2">essentially you know and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.730" end="00:24:06.799" style="s2">happens with social media right so we</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.129" end="00:24:09.230" style="s2">are now instantly connected to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.799" end="00:24:11.450" style="s2">in the world virtually we can broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.230" end="00:24:12.889" style="s2">a signal that anyone can pick up on so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.450" end="00:24:15.019" style="s2">that long range connection doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.889" end="00:24:17.299" style="s2">have to be robust it doesn&#39;t even have</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.019" end="00:24:19.070" style="s2">to be something massive infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.299" end="00:24:20.989" style="s2">project they just happened sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.070" end="00:24:23.029" style="s2">instantly now and in the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.989" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">historical context if you zoom way out</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.029" end="00:24:29.389" style="s2">we went from nothing to everything in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:31.029" style="s2">blink of an eye basically and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.389" end="00:24:33.590" style="s2">it&#39;s safe to say that our brains</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.029" end="00:24:36.169" style="s2">probably haven&#39;t caught off our society</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.590" end="00:24:38.210" style="s2">probably hasn&#39;t caught up our culture</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.169" end="00:24:40.190" style="s2">our norms or customs haven&#39;t caught up</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.210" end="00:24:42.379" style="s2">to the fact that we have these built-in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.190" end="00:24:44.989" style="s2">long-range connections both physically</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.379" end="00:24:47.179" style="s2">for goods for people for services for</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.989" end="00:24:49.999" style="s2">information now for ideas and social</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.179" end="00:24:52.129" style="s2">connections and so anything can travel</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.999" end="00:24:55.580" style="s2">basically all around the world to all of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.129" end="00:24:58.159" style="s2">us all at once and I read in one of your</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.580" end="00:25:00.950" style="s2">papers you were talking about how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.159" end="00:25:04.279" style="s2">need to start thinking of the world as</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.950" end="00:25:07.429" style="s2">an ecosystem of organisms and not the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.279" end="00:25:09.470" style="s2">organism itself so in my mind I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.429" end="00:25:11.659" style="s2">thinking about this like if we&#39;re all if</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.470" end="00:25:13.309" style="s2">we all have long-range connections then</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.659" end="00:25:16.070" style="s2">basically we&#39;re all short-range</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.309" end="00:25:18.200" style="s2">connected in a way right and so we kind</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.070" end="00:25:19.759" style="s2">of are have built ourselves into being</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.200" end="00:25:21.679" style="s2">and maybe I&#39;m wrong you can you can tell</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.759" end="00:25:24.769" style="s2">me and we&#39;ve built ourselves into being</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.679" end="00:25:26.840" style="s2">like one giant organism but you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.769" end="00:25:28.639" style="s2">written that you believe it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.840" end="00:25:31.759" style="s2">for us to believe to look at ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.639" end="00:25:33.830" style="s2">as an ecosystem of organisms rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.759" end="00:25:35.899" style="s2">just one singular organism can you</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.830" end="00:25:36.470" style="s2">expand on that tell me if I was right or</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.899" end="00:25:38.750" style="s2">wrong and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.470" end="00:25:40.850" style="s2">I assumed and and to sort of relate its</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.750" end="00:25:42.049" style="s2">what we&#39;re experiencing right now yes so</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.850" end="00:25:44.419" style="s2">so it&#39;s definitely related to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.049" end="00:25:45.980" style="s2">connectivity and how close we are to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.419" end="00:25:48.590" style="s2">each other and the fact that if</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.980" end="00:25:50.600" style="s2">something infects one part of the system</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.590" end="00:25:54.140" style="s2">it centrally cascades the entire system</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.600" end="00:25:56.120" style="s2">readily and it&#39;s also the centralization</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.140" end="00:25:59.510" style="s2">of function and the lack of functional</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.120" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">redundancy so you know when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.510" end="00:26:04.220" style="s2">the way we&#39;ve we&#39;ve centralized global</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:06.020" style="s2">manufacturing to China yeah sure other</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.220" end="00:26:08.390" style="s2">countries manufactured but no-one&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.020" end="00:26:10.820" style="s2">manufacturing powerhouse like China so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.390" end="00:26:14.030" style="s2">what happens when China manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.820" end="00:26:16.039" style="s2">goes down well that has massive effects</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.030" end="00:26:17.900" style="s2">on the entire globe it&#39;s bit similar to</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.039" end="00:26:19.100" style="s2">you know you have a heart attack how</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.900" end="00:26:20.840" style="s2">does that affect the rest of your body</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.100" end="00:26:24.020" style="s2">well as massive effect on the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.840" end="00:26:26.299" style="s2">your body so in that paper I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.020" end="00:26:27.799" style="s2">in part responding to I&#39;ve seen from</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.299" end="00:26:32.120" style="s2">several sources several perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.799" end="00:26:33.950" style="s2">offer that kind of solution for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.120" end="00:26:36.190" style="s2">global problems is to become like a</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.950" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">super organism at the global scale but</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.190" end="00:26:39.799" style="s2">organisms have this property of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:42.470" style="s2">single points of failure these</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.799" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">centralized functions and so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.470" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">want to be that it&#39;s it&#39;s great when</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:49.429" style="s2">things are working well and when they go</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:52.909" style="s2">wrong it&#39;s a catastrophe so at a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.429" end="00:26:56.360" style="s2">we need to be a planet of several</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.909" end="00:26:59.059" style="s2">organisms such that you know as sad as</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.360" end="00:27:00.620" style="s2">it is when one organism dies it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.059" end="00:27:03.559" style="s2">kill off the whole species it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.620" end="00:27:06.289" style="s2">kill off the whole ecosystem the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.559" end="00:27:08.330" style="s2">larger system that&#39;s embedded in is able</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.289" end="00:27:10.970" style="s2">to go on in many cases even involve and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.330" end="00:27:13.250" style="s2">become something better stronger or at</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.970" end="00:27:16.419" style="s2">least different and that&#39;s that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.250" end="00:27:19.429" style="s2">of like an ecosystem an ecosystem is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.419" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have a well-defined</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.429" end="00:27:22.659" style="s2">trajectory like a single organism where</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.130" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of this development</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.659" end="00:27:27.860" style="s2">unfolding and then then senescence and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.130" end="00:27:30.110" style="s2">death it&#39;s something that is contains</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.860" end="00:27:32.990" style="s2">organisms that interact and evolve</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.110" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">within that system and kind of have an</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.990" end="00:27:37.850" style="s2">open-ended quality to them where where</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:41.450" style="s2">the forms that an ecosystem can take</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.850" end="00:27:43.100" style="s2">over long periods of time are either</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.450" end="00:27:46.669" style="s2">very difficult to determine or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.100" end="00:27:48.440" style="s2">even indeterminate so we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.669" end="00:27:50.600" style="s2">to evolve we need to not be so rigid</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.440" end="00:27:52.610" style="s2">that there you go a single thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.600" end="00:27:54.530" style="s2">can take us out and so an organism is</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.610" end="00:27:57.440" style="s2">just the wrong just the wrong model</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.530" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">right so globalism basically was this</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.440" end="00:28:00.200" style="s2">idea that we&#39;d all become super</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:02.360" style="s2">connected and that would be great for</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.200" end="00:28:05.000" style="s2">everybody but what we&#39;re learning right</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.360" end="00:28:07.730" style="s2">now and again related to social media</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.000" end="00:28:11.809" style="s2">because mimetic you know infection is</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.730" end="00:28:15.169" style="s2">the same way and viral infection is also</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.809" end="00:28:17.210" style="s2">the same way this the super connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.169" end="00:28:19.549" style="s2">that we have actually is bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.210" end="00:28:22.130" style="s2">additional risk that we had not</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.549" end="00:28:23.480" style="s2">considered and fascinating for me is</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.130" end="00:28:25.789" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been working on all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.480" end="00:28:28.640" style="s2">subjects sort of all the food that went</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.789" end="00:28:31.309" style="s2">into this mess talking to guys like Sam</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.640" end="00:28:33.140" style="s2">Hammonds about the shine the China Shock</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.309" end="00:28:35.990" style="s2">Doctrine where we basically just handed</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.140" end="00:28:38.510" style="s2">over our manufacturing and an important</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.990" end="00:28:40.400" style="s2">national defense manufacturing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.510" end="00:28:43.190" style="s2">pharmaceutical manufacturing all over to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.400" end="00:28:45.770" style="s2">China I&#39;ve been talking to Jordan Hall</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.190" end="00:28:47.900" style="s2">about designing systems that for</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.770" end="00:28:50.299" style="s2">emergence rather than for a specific</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.900" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">goal and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.299" end="00:28:53.990" style="s2">liminal order we didn&#39;t set out to</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:55.850" style="s2">achieve a specific thing we designed a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.990" end="00:28:57.580" style="s2">system that would foster emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.850" end="00:29:00.289" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen that happening</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.580" end="00:29:05.000" style="s2">and then so when we start to see what</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.289" end="00:29:07.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve done in response to corona social</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.000" end="00:29:10.250" style="s2">distancing and I was talk to Jeffrey</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.250" end="00:29:13.010" style="s2">Miller about this and he reminded me of</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.250" end="00:29:15.820" style="s2">the subject of adaptive disconnection</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.010" end="00:29:19.190" style="s2">which is found in biology and nature and</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.820" end="00:29:22.190" style="s2">and and we now I see a parallel to</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.190" end="00:29:24.020" style="s2">social distancing as well so can you</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.190" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">explain a little bit about what adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.020" end="00:29:29.030" style="s2">disconnection is and and how that might</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:31.640" style="s2">be something favorable and just one last</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.030" end="00:29:34.520" style="s2">thought before you answer that when we</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.640" end="00:29:38.000" style="s2">are one eeeek one organism there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.520" end="00:29:40.220" style="s2">healthy competition and that is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.000" end="00:29:42.980" style="s2">thing right we need to have open</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.220" end="00:29:44.299" style="s2">landscape of competition so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.980" end="00:29:46.340" style="s2">have the best ideas and the best</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.299" end="00:29:48.650" style="s2">outcomes bubble up to the surface in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.340" end="00:29:50.450" style="s2">long run and again that&#39;s sort of if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.650" end="00:29:53.330" style="s2">if you just put that in a political</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.450" end="00:29:55.520" style="s2">context you know it&#39;s almost defines the</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.330" end="00:29:57.950" style="s2">differences between the rights and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.520" end="00:29:59.809" style="s2">left is that we we want to have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.950" end="00:30:01.350" style="s2">environment that breeds for emergence</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.809" end="00:30:02.640" style="s2">that breeds competition</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.350" end="00:30:04.410" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna give us our healthiest</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.640" end="00:30:07.020" style="s2">outcome that involves things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.410" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">adaptive disconnection and avoids things</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.020" end="00:30:11.549" style="s2">like this indiscriminate connectivity</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:13.500" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had where you become one</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.549" end="00:30:15.330" style="s2">organism and if something fails within</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.500" end="00:30:18.299" style="s2">the organism the whole thing dies so</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.330" end="00:30:20.789" style="s2">what what can we do what what will help</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.299" end="00:30:22.770" style="s2">us put this in more context and and talk</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.789" end="00:30:25.710" style="s2">to me about adaptive disconnection and</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.770" end="00:30:27.419" style="s2">relate it to its existence biology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.710" end="00:30:30.840" style="s2">then into our sort of social life that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.419" end="00:30:35.820" style="s2">we just did in response to Corona well</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.840" end="00:30:39.419" style="s2">so you know one of the possible</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.820" end="00:30:42.390" style="s2">responses to issues of contagion</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.419" end="00:30:46.890" style="s2">pandemic systemic risk is to decouple is</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.390" end="00:30:49.140" style="s2">to be relatively independent systems the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:51.480" style="s2">downside of that is there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.140" end="00:30:54.059" style="s2">opportunities in being connected into</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.480" end="00:30:56.580" style="s2">trading goods long range into all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.059" end="00:30:59.490" style="s2">those things so it kind of compromise is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.580" end="00:31:02.280" style="s2">a system that takes the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.490" end="00:31:04.620" style="s2">have long-range connections and to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.280" end="00:31:06.210" style="s2">know if some country does a really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.620" end="00:31:08.340" style="s2">job with something and you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.210" end="00:31:12.210" style="s2">that stuff from them then go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.340" end="00:31:15.240" style="s2">do that but then when you detect that</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.210" end="00:31:16.620" style="s2">something spreading is happening if</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.240" end="00:31:18.659" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s some systemic risks</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.620" end="00:31:20.429" style="s2">starting to grow and unfold then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.659" end="00:31:22.380" style="s2">able to say you know what we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.429" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna stop international flights</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.380" end="00:31:26.520" style="s2">and kind of see see what&#39;s going on and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:28.440" style="s2">reorient and observe and a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.520" end="00:31:30.090" style="s2">disconnection from from my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.440" end="00:31:32.669" style="s2">should be that way it shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.090" end="00:31:35.880" style="s2">thought of as a solution so much as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.669" end="00:31:38.010" style="s2">way to slow down the dynamics and to</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.880" end="00:31:40.169" style="s2">orient but if it would a loop type of</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.010" end="00:31:42.900" style="s2">thing where you kind of get getting the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.169" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">opportunity to orient to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.900" end="00:31:50.400" style="s2">and then make better informed decisions</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:52.770" style="s2">by yourself a little time so and this</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.400" end="00:31:55.409" style="s2">goes back to you know when when Trump</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.770" end="00:31:56.730" style="s2">shut down flights from China the better</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.409" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">call would have been to shut down all</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.730" end="00:32:00.750" style="s2">international flights no we got a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:02.190" style="s2">stuff from Italy not that surprising I</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.750" end="00:32:04.500" style="s2">mean maybe it&#39;s surprising that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.190" end="00:32:06.270" style="s2">Italy specifically but that it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.500" end="00:32:07.590" style="s2">somewhere else too you know and came in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.270" end="00:32:11.190" style="s2">anyway should not have been a surprise</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.590" end="00:32:13.140" style="s2">and and so that ability to to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.190" end="00:32:14.940" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna pause these connections for</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.140" end="00:32:17.220" style="s2">now we know that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.940" end="00:32:18.929" style="s2">we&#39;ll resume them later or that in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.220" end="00:32:20.450" style="s2">cases ago need to resume them later but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.929" end="00:32:24.840" style="s2">for this moment we&#39;re gonna pause them</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.450" end="00:32:26.299" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been we did it we did it</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.840" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">reluctantly</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.299" end="00:32:30.179" style="s2">the reason we&#39;re reluctant is because</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:34.409" style="s2">how much it will cost and ends up</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.179" end="00:32:35.820" style="s2">costing more because we wait right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.409" end="00:32:37.889" style="s2">that&#39;s the adaptive part of that rather</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.820" end="00:32:40.320" style="s2">than rather than adaptive to imply</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.889" end="00:32:43.019" style="s2">dynamic and and context-sensitive as</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.320" end="00:32:44.720" style="s2">opposed to sort of something rigid</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.019" end="00:32:47.309" style="s2">structured and fixed forever in time</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.720" end="00:32:51.479" style="s2">right so it sounds like we need to build</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.309" end="00:32:53.729" style="s2">into this system triggers and and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.479" end="00:32:55.379" style="s2">know failsafe systems basically where I</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.729" end="00:32:57.389" style="s2">mean like a fuse or something right like</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.379" end="00:32:59.039" style="s2">in the old days you know if the if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.389" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">circuit overheats the thing just pops</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.039" end="00:33:01.830" style="s2">and cuts everything off to protect the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">house I mean that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.830" end="00:33:06.659" style="s2">analogy and it seems to me that we need</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:08.729" style="s2">something like that with all of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.659" end="00:33:11.789" style="s2">physical connections I&#39;ve also seen</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.729" end="00:33:14.429" style="s2">people talking about how to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.789" end="00:33:16.649" style="s2">social media in such a way now I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.429" end="00:33:19.229" style="s2">know how we&#39;re gonna do this but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.649" end="00:33:21.869" style="s2">seen people suggest that a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.229" end="00:33:25.080" style="s2">like you know viral spread of fake news</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.869" end="00:33:28.919" style="s2">or panic or whatever is is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.080" end="00:33:31.139" style="s2">throttling on social media as well which</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.919" end="00:33:33.840" style="s2">fits in sort of theoretically within the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.139" end="00:33:36.289" style="s2">same conversation I don&#39;t know how we go</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.840" end="00:33:38.849" style="s2">about doing that in practice though</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.289" end="00:33:40.349" style="s2">especially because of all the bet and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.849" end="00:33:41.489" style="s2">this is the same struggle right all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.349" end="00:33:43.109" style="s2">benefits that come from these</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.489" end="00:33:45.269" style="s2">connections and the speed at which they</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.109" end="00:33:46.830" style="s2">occur but there&#39;s also some serious</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.269" end="00:33:47.070" style="s2">downside so you have any thoughts on</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.830" end="00:33:50.190" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.070" end="00:33:51.690" style="s2">so the difference I see between these</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.190" end="00:33:53.460" style="s2">two I mean there&#39;s a few differences</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.690" end="00:33:56.609" style="s2">obviously but but one of the important</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.460" end="00:33:57.749" style="s2">differences is the fact that for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.609" end="00:33:59.820" style="s2">kind of throttling it sounds like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.749" end="00:34:02.220" style="s2">describing that would almost be like at</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.820" end="00:34:04.889" style="s2">the central control central command like</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.220" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">throttling it down with some a I or some</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.889" end="00:34:09.779" style="s2">BS like that so when I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:12.869" style="s2">you know we need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.779" end="00:34:14.490" style="s2">adaptively decouple our trade relations</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.869" end="00:34:16.500" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying that there needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.490" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">some Authority that&#39;s propped up that</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.500" end="00:34:20.970" style="s2">decides when that happens I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:22.710" style="s2">saying that we as say a sovereign nation</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.970" end="00:34:25.079" style="s2">make that decision we&#39;re not letting</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.710" end="00:34:26.669" style="s2">anyone in right now we&#39;re decoupling so</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.079" end="00:34:28.230" style="s2">social media already has a lot of that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.669" end="00:34:30.659" style="s2">mean I use the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.230" end="00:34:32.580" style="s2">button liberally I think you do too yes</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.659" end="00:34:35.030" style="s2">and it you know Twitter would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.580" end="00:34:36.899" style="s2">unusable without that yeah and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.030" end="00:34:39.929" style="s2">you know a lot people complain about</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.899" end="00:34:41.399" style="s2">echo chambers and tribalism and things</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.929" end="00:34:45.119" style="s2">like that but actually that&#39;s the way I</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.399" end="00:34:48.330" style="s2">see that is a kind of re-emergence of</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.119" end="00:34:51.480" style="s2">our localist tendencies in the virtual</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.330" end="00:34:53.820" style="s2">space yes we just do we need boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.480" end="00:34:55.260" style="s2">we need to know who&#39;s on the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.820" end="00:34:56.700" style="s2">who is on the outside</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.260" end="00:34:59.070" style="s2">what is the system what is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.700" end="00:35:01.380" style="s2">environment you know in in system</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.070" end="00:35:03.480" style="s2">science one of the first things you do</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.380" end="00:35:05.430" style="s2">if you&#39;re analyzing something is to make</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.480" end="00:35:06.950" style="s2">that decision in your analysis what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.430" end="00:35:10.200" style="s2">the system and what&#39;s the environment</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.950" end="00:35:12.840" style="s2">that&#39;s there&#39;s it&#39;s not there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.200" end="00:35:15.390" style="s2">objective means of deciding where that</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.840" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">exists there are some but in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.390" end="00:35:18.330" style="s2">it&#39;s also a judgement call</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:19.290" style="s2">you know if I&#39;m interested for instance</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.330" end="00:35:21.690" style="s2">let&#39;s say I&#39;m interested in studying the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:23.670" style="s2">nervous system do I then consider the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.690" end="00:35:25.170" style="s2">nervous system to have a boundary and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.670" end="00:35:29.910" style="s2">its environment is the rest of the body</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.170" end="00:35:31.619" style="s2">or is the the whole organism the system</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.910" end="00:35:37.320" style="s2">the the environment is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.619" end="00:35:42.630" style="s2">interacting with so these basic sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.320" end="00:35:44.580" style="s2">bounded patterns are essential in in all</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.630" end="00:35:47.190" style="s2">of the systems that were embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.580" end="00:35:48.630" style="s2">that we generate and and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.190" end="00:35:50.850" style="s2">things that I think we&#39;ve seen is relate</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.630" end="00:35:55.400" style="s2">to all of this is this sort of through</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.850" end="00:35:57.510" style="s2">the modern period a belief that</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.400" end="00:36:01.890" style="s2">boundaries in general or somehow</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.510" end="00:36:05.820" style="s2">antiquated not necessary whenever</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.890" end="00:36:06.660" style="s2">backwards and that&#39;s just couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.820" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">further from the truth</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.660" end="00:36:10.859" style="s2">and and moreover the idea that if we</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.480" end="00:36:14.700" style="s2">eliminated boundaries what we get is</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.859" end="00:36:15.900" style="s2">integration and actually when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.700" end="00:36:16.980" style="s2">system that needs to work let&#39;s say if</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.900" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">you&#39;re doing software development or</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.980" end="00:36:22.350" style="s2">something to get a very complex piece of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:24.869" style="s2">software to integrate properly demands</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.350" end="00:36:27.720" style="s2">that you draw appropriate boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.869" end="00:36:29.310" style="s2">around the components so so these two</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.720" end="00:36:30.660" style="s2">things are not actually completely in</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.310" end="00:36:32.670" style="s2">concert they&#39;re not in contradiction at</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.660" end="00:36:34.530" style="s2">all we need to have the right boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.670" end="00:36:37.800" style="s2">that allow the system to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.530" end="00:36:39.810" style="s2">properly at multiple scales man it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.800" end="00:36:41.819" style="s2">fascinating to me how many parallels</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.810" end="00:36:45.449" style="s2">there are between this</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.819" end="00:36:48.509" style="s2">social media biology viruses politics</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.449" end="00:36:50.819" style="s2">you know woke ISM spreading all over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.509" end="00:36:53.190" style="s2">place you know when it comes to social</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.819" end="00:36:54.869" style="s2">media and my and me blocking I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.869" end="00:36:59.009" style="s2">blocking to get rid of idiots and what I</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.329" end="00:37:00.900" style="s2">want are people that are engaged in</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.900" end="00:37:04.410" style="s2">my tribe is people engaged in actual</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.410" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">that&#39;s why I&#39;ll slam Trump when he needs</p>

<p begin="00:37:17.849" end="00:37:21.390" style="s2">we&#39;re doing the same thing in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.140" end="00:37:22.589" style="s2">liminal order - we&#39;ve experienced the</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.390" end="00:37:24.690" style="s2">negative side effects of being</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.589" end="00:37:26.549" style="s2">indiscriminately connected myself I got</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.690" end="00:37:28.589" style="s2">docked by an information attacked by an</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.549" end="00:37:31.229" style="s2">Tifa and they ruined my life in many</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.589" end="00:37:32.759" style="s2">ways and and I realized that I was just</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.229" end="00:37:34.380" style="s2">totally out there and exposed with all</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.759" end="00:37:36.779" style="s2">of my connectors like saying engage</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.380" end="00:37:39.150" style="s2">engage engage but instead I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.779" end="00:37:41.190" style="s2">erect a little bit of a barrier and give</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.150" end="00:37:42.739" style="s2">myself a chance to build some strength</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.989" end="00:37:57.479" style="s2">on the outside I&#39;m just continuously</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.289" end="00:38:00.630" style="s2">fascinated by all of these parallels and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.479" end="00:38:02.459" style="s2">and unfortunately unfortunately this</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.630" end="00:38:04.529" style="s2">phrase inevitable death cascade keeps</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.459" end="00:38:07.289" style="s2">coming to mind because if the system</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.529" end="00:38:09.239" style="s2">keeps up at the way it&#39;s going and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.289" end="00:38:11.099" style="s2">this complexity continues and these</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.239" end="00:38:14.999" style="s2">long-range connections continue without</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.099" end="00:38:17.640" style="s2">any discrimination whatsoever it seems</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.999" end="00:38:20.400" style="s2">to me that you have a feeling that quote</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.640" end="00:38:22.349" style="s2">extinction becomes certain so can we</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.400" end="00:38:24.269" style="s2">talk about how that all plays together</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.349" end="00:38:26.789" style="s2">in our system and the trajectory that</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.269" end="00:38:29.849" style="s2">we&#39;re on what do what do we do to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.789" end="00:38:32.849" style="s2">prevent the inevitable death cascade and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.849" end="00:38:34.529" style="s2">the extinction becoming certain due to</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.529" end="00:38:38.940" style="s2">have built for ourselves I mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.049" end="00:38:40.799" style="s2">basically there&#39;s basically one place</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.940" end="00:38:42.869" style="s2">that we&#39;re going and that is a less</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.799" end="00:38:44.670" style="s2">connected system there&#39;s two ways of</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.869" end="00:38:48.839" style="s2">getting there there&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.670" end="00:38:51.619" style="s2">thoughtful intentional way and the kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.839" end="00:38:55.410" style="s2">of kicking and screaming way and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.619" end="00:38:57.960" style="s2">essentially our institutions our systems</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.410" end="00:39:01.530" style="s2">see systems that we continued to depend</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.960" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">on can&#39;t handle either the complexity or</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.530" end="00:39:06.869" style="s2">the scale of the events that are now</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:08.789" style="s2">commonplace and so when they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.869" end="00:39:12.170" style="s2">handle that then they will break and</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.789" end="00:39:12.170" style="s2">something else will take their place</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.490" end="00:39:19.410" style="s2">you know the u.s. is a really special</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.610" end="00:39:21.240" style="s2">place in terms of it was so</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.410" end="00:39:23.970" style="s2">intentionally set up as a federated</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.240" end="00:39:27.480" style="s2">system I mean we have 50 states that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.970" end="00:39:28.980" style="s2">that&#39;s no small number and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.480" end="00:39:32.580" style="s2">inside the 50 laboratories or</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.980" end="00:39:35.010" style="s2">libertarianism idea of that we could</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.580" end="00:39:38.310" style="s2">make the political decisions to start to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.010" end="00:39:40.140" style="s2">devolve and return to that and we would</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.310" end="00:39:42.810" style="s2">experience everyone would experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.140" end="00:39:44.520" style="s2">much more harmony and where failure</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.810" end="00:39:47.730" style="s2">occurred it would be at a much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.520" end="00:39:51.240" style="s2">scale and so you you you sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.730" end="00:39:53.490" style="s2">the benefits of many places as things</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.240" end="00:39:55.230" style="s2">working a lot better and as well as the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.490" end="00:39:58.020" style="s2">risk reduction of when things don&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.230" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">well the scale at which that happens is</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.020" end="00:40:02.460" style="s2">a lot smaller and that this is really</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:04.619" style="s2">related to this idea of localism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.460" end="00:40:07.050" style="s2">bringing decisions as close to home as</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.619" end="00:40:09.000" style="s2">possible and for different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.050" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">issues that scale is different some</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.000" end="00:40:13.110" style="s2">things are right to take care of on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:15.660" style="s2">homestead some are right to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.110" end="00:40:17.700" style="s2">in town some are right in the state and</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.660" end="00:40:20.160" style="s2">some are right at the nation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.700" end="00:40:21.600" style="s2">exactly how we&#39;ve been set up is with a</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.160" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">recognition that there&#39;s really these</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.600" end="00:40:31.050" style="s2">these different scales of behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:34.080" style="s2">of problems and the system needs to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.050" end="00:40:38.340" style="s2">those scales to match those those issues</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.080" end="00:40:39.990" style="s2">and you know I I do think there is some</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.340" end="00:40:44.100" style="s2">hope in that happening you know funny</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.990" end="00:40:45.600" style="s2">enough even though it&#39;s a bit of a kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.100" end="00:40:47.970" style="s2">of a comic strip in many ways this chess</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.600" end="00:40:51.109" style="s2">thing going on so Tata Mazzone it</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.970" end="00:40:52.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t surprise me at all</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.109" end="00:40:53.850" style="s2">decentralization is where we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.770" end="00:40:56.359" style="s2">these are people that feel that they</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.850" end="00:40:58.830" style="s2">have a certain set of values and</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.359" end="00:41:00.570" style="s2">cultural practices and all these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.830" end="00:41:04.890" style="s2">they feel are very important to them and</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.570" end="00:41:07.080" style="s2">so what do they do they made a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.890" end="00:41:08.609" style="s2">area formed a boundary said when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.080" end="00:41:10.080" style="s2">on the inside you&#39;re in chess when</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.609" end="00:41:12.119" style="s2">you&#39;re on the outside you&#39;re out of</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.080" end="00:41:15.210" style="s2">chess and here&#39;s how we do things in</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.119" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">chess you know they like I said it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.210" end="00:41:19.740" style="s2">bit it&#39;s a bit of a joke because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:21.660" style="s2">not really set up to you know feed</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.740" end="00:41:22.800" style="s2">themselves and all that or trade for</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.660" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">food or anything like that but</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.800" end="00:41:26.530" style="s2">nevertheless the the sort of it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">symptom of something deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.530" end="00:41:31.000" style="s2">it&#39;s happening everywhere with all of us</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.410" style="s2">so the thing about localism there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.000" end="00:41:37.570" style="s2">many ways to start to penetrate that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.410" end="00:41:41.530" style="s2">because it&#39;s a kind of a meta system</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.570" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">structure that would allow many more</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.530" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">natural organic patterns to unfold and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:48.040" style="s2">so and so it&#39;s a hard thing to penetrate</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:49.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s like well do you do it for</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.040" end="00:41:53.710" style="s2">this reason or that reason it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.270" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">all of the above but yeah I mean I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.710" end="00:42:01.540" style="s2">I mean local autonomy local sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:02.910" style="s2">and scaling up decision-making only when</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.540" end="00:42:06.490" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.910" end="00:42:08.890" style="s2">subsidiarity principle is that could get</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.490" end="00:42:10.990" style="s2">us by without that inevitable death</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.890" end="00:42:12.640" style="s2">cascade yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.990" end="00:42:14.650" style="s2">I&#39;m glad that you brought up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.640" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">autonomous zones I&#39;m getting I&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.650" end="00:42:19.210" style="s2">like excited because these issues are so</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:22.120" style="s2">relevant to me my personal life my work</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.210" end="00:42:24.310" style="s2">the country it&#39;s I&#39;ve had lately do I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.120" end="00:42:25.810" style="s2">had like a singularity lately where like</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.310" end="00:42:27.760" style="s2">all these issues I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.810" end="00:42:30.040" style="s2">starting with radical feminism and woke</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.760" end="00:42:32.670" style="s2">ISM and antifa and emergent networks and</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.040" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">information warfare and 4g warfare and</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.670" end="00:42:37.330" style="s2">connectivity and disconnection versus</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:38.860" style="s2">connection all of it&#39;s happening all</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.330" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">ones and then the riots happened in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.860" end="00:42:41.710" style="s2">own backyard so I knew all the players</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:42.640" style="s2">and all the streets and all that</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.710" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">everything it&#39;s just like the</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.640" end="00:42:46.510" style="s2">singularity for me all happening all at</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:49.060" style="s2">once so it&#39;s it&#39;s actually been I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.510" end="00:42:51.580" style="s2">it&#39;s sad moment in America in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.060" end="00:42:54.130" style="s2">but it&#39;s been really exciting for me if</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.580" end="00:42:55.330" style="s2">I&#39;m allowed to be so crass because this</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.130" end="00:42:57.790" style="s2">is just what I&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.330" end="00:42:59.950" style="s2">thinking on so much and the autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.790" end="00:43:02.290" style="s2">zones it&#39;s something that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.950" end="00:43:04.510" style="s2">talk to you about it fits in within an</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.290" end="00:43:07.120" style="s2">adaptive disconnection model right it</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.510" end="00:43:10.690" style="s2">fits in with with a decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.120" end="00:43:12.790" style="s2">model it&#39;s also what I see is a natural</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.690" end="00:43:14.530" style="s2">extension of the existing sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.790" end="00:43:16.060" style="s2">cities and counties and states that</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.530" end="00:43:18.610" style="s2">we&#39;ve had in the in the United States</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.060" end="00:43:20.230" style="s2">for for years actually now and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.610" end="00:43:22.780" style="s2">both on the left and the right you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.230" end="00:43:25.330" style="s2">got immigration sanctuary cities you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.780" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">got Second Amendment gun sanctuary</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:30.820" style="s2">counties in Virginia now you&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:33.580" style="s2">actual autonomous zone in Washington</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.820" end="00:43:35.380" style="s2">State Chaz as it&#39;s been called and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.580" end="00:43:37.990" style="s2">frankly I got to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.380" end="00:43:39.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t support their agenda I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.990" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">support what they&#39;re doing in a way</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.460" end="00:43:44.410" style="s2">because in if you fast forward many</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:46.390" style="s2">years from now it&#39;s entirely possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.410" end="00:43:48.849" style="s2">that there&#39;s gonna be no more of these</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.390" end="00:43:50.559" style="s2">right and based around a number of</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.849" end="00:43:52.420" style="s2">different issues whether it&#39;s my kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.559" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">issues my values or their values or</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.420" end="00:43:59.289" style="s2">whatever this this decentralization</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:01.029" style="s2">theme is we can&#39;t stop it it&#39;s just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.289" end="00:44:03.430" style="s2">what&#39;s happening and it&#39;s because of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.029" end="00:44:05.529" style="s2">system and the federal government had</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.529" end="00:44:10.509" style="s2">for so many years starting really back</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.289" end="00:44:13.029" style="s2">what like around 19th late 19th century</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.509" end="00:44:14.769" style="s2">early 20th century and this it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.029" end="00:44:16.240" style="s2">been growing and growing and growing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.769" end="00:44:17.799" style="s2">then spreading that into the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.240" end="00:44:19.900" style="s2">community and trying to centralize</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.799" end="00:44:21.369" style="s2">everything WTO we&#39;re gonna decide</p>

<p begin="00:44:21.369" end="00:44:25.990" style="s2">everything but here we go we&#39;ve got an</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.799" end="00:44:28.059" style="s2">autonomous zone we&#39;re exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.990" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve set up a border thinks they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.059" end="00:44:32.799" style="s2">adaptively disconnected from the network</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:35.589" style="s2">that they don&#39;t like and they&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.799" end="00:44:37.779" style="s2">it a shot right and you know my advice</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.589" end="00:44:40.119" style="s2">to trump right now is just to let it go</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.779" end="00:44:42.400" style="s2">and just see see what happens it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.119" end="00:44:46.539" style="s2">gonna work for them long run because</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.400" end="00:44:47.829" style="s2">they didn&#39;t start with like a farm they</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.539" end="00:44:51.369" style="s2">didn&#39;t start with the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.829" end="00:44:53.500" style="s2">need and it&#39;s just sort of a frolic or a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.369" end="00:44:55.089" style="s2">lark for them I think and in a 4G</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.500" end="00:44:57.160" style="s2">warfare context they&#39;ve gone from</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.089" end="00:44:59.529" style="s2">fighting a network war and a surgeon see</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.160" end="00:45:01.269" style="s2">war to basically like creating a trench</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.529" end="00:45:03.460" style="s2">and holding the line so I&#39;m happy to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.269" end="00:45:04.809" style="s2">them distracted by that go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.460" end="00:45:08.410" style="s2">hold your territory while the network</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.809" end="00:45:11.829" style="s2">war rages on I like to see that so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.410" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">brought up localism which was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.829" end="00:45:17.109" style="s2">our crescendo here I want to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:19.630" style="s2">this is this is your answer or at least</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.109" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">one of your answers to this complexity</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.630" end="00:45:25.630" style="s2">problem the inevitable extinction desk</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:29.230" style="s2">cascade the problems of long-range</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.630" end="00:45:32.890" style="s2">connections localism tell me what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.230" end="00:45:36.160" style="s2">mean by localism how do you live local</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.890" end="00:45:38.380" style="s2">ISM in your life what do we do to spread</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:40.329" style="s2">this idea you fought with me about</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.380" end="00:45:42.099" style="s2">nationalism I&#39;m saying nationalism is</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.329" end="00:45:44.619" style="s2">Hell itself cared you&#39;re like no no not</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.099" end="00:45:47.019" style="s2">nationalism localism which is fine all</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.619" end="00:45:49.300" style="s2">on the same vibe right on the same path</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.019" end="00:45:52.420" style="s2">so tell me what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.300" end="00:45:55.180" style="s2">you how are you living it how do we</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.420" end="00:45:56.740" style="s2">spread this idea it&#39;s set for etc lay it</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.180" end="00:46:01.360" style="s2">on me Joe this is where I wanted to go</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.740" end="00:46:05.310" style="s2">all right so so localism let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.360" end="00:46:09.330" style="s2">start with how I&#39;m living it yes</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.310" end="00:46:12.540" style="s2">I we moved to a spot New Hampshire</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.330" end="00:46:16.490" style="s2">almost two years ago now we moved with</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.540" end="00:46:19.070" style="s2">the idea of living a more local life</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.490" end="00:46:24.060" style="s2">primarily that&#39;s centered around food</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.070" end="00:46:28.290" style="s2">our where we get our food what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.060" end="00:46:30.540" style="s2">eating how we prepare it all that so one</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.290" end="00:46:33.270" style="s2">of the nice things about this area is</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.540" end="00:46:36.390" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of hilly and rocky</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.270" end="00:46:40.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s actually spared the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.390" end="00:46:43.220" style="s2">industrial agriculture spread sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.680" end="00:46:46.260" style="s2">take over so we have a lot of nice</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.220" end="00:46:47.700" style="s2">legacy small farms around here where</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.260" end="00:46:50.100" style="s2">people are you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.700" end="00:46:52.350" style="s2">necessarily paying for their usda</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.100" end="00:46:54.060" style="s2">organic sticker but they don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.350" end="00:46:56.370" style="s2">they do everything the old-fashioned way</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.060" end="00:46:58.170" style="s2">they build a compost pile and they you</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.370" end="00:47:01.830" style="s2">know there&#39;s no chemicals no nothing so</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.170" end="00:47:03.390" style="s2">so we&#39;re really fortunate to get I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.830" end="00:47:06.900" style="s2">say close to a hundred percent of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.390" end="00:47:12.330" style="s2">food comes from within 15 miles of us</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.900" end="00:47:14.250" style="s2">nice that&#39;s that was kind of the first</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.330" end="00:47:17.810" style="s2">thing then of course we bought a</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.250" end="00:47:21.720" style="s2">property that has a few acres and</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.810" end="00:47:23.640" style="s2">started growing our own food got</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.720" end="00:47:25.230" style="s2">chickens started learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.640" end="00:47:29.790" style="s2">cultivate the land learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.230" end="00:47:32.490" style="s2">manage the forests so all of that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.790" end="00:47:34.140" style="s2">truth is that that work takes a really</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.490" end="00:47:37.080" style="s2">long time to learn for one thing because</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.140" end="00:47:39.330" style="s2">I&#39;m not doing it full-time I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.080" end="00:47:40.680" style="s2">as a data scientist a lot of the time so</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.330" end="00:47:44.100" style="s2">I&#39;m attached to the computer like so</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.680" end="00:47:45.960" style="s2">many other people nevertheless so so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.100" end="00:47:47.820" style="s2">many of those iterations are one year so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.960" end="00:47:49.470" style="s2">it takes one year to kind do something</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.820" end="00:47:50.790" style="s2">and to figure out was that a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.470" end="00:47:53.460" style="s2">was that a bad thing that it matter at</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.790" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">all so it&#39;s very slow and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.460" end="00:47:58.530" style="s2">that a lot of frankly what we lost in</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:48:00.450" style="s2">terms of know-how will take a long time</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.530" end="00:48:02.340" style="s2">to recover because a lot of people got</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.450" end="00:48:04.380" style="s2">to put a lot of time into into building</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.340" end="00:48:07.560" style="s2">those skills back up to have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.380" end="00:48:09.060" style="s2">genuine robust localist system so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.560" end="00:48:10.950" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing in our life and</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.060" end="00:48:13.050" style="s2">you know actually recently I can add</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.950" end="00:48:14.550" style="s2">another thing on there you mentioned in</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.050" end="00:48:15.600" style="s2">the beginning up front so I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.550" end="00:48:19.490" style="s2">remember this before we start recording</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.600" end="00:48:24.230" style="s2">or not but we got a fire on our prop</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.490" end="00:48:28.500" style="s2">sucked but the Volunteer Fire Department</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.230" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">showed up in five minutes and so that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.500" end="00:48:31.589" style="s2">was incredible I couldn&#39;t believe I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:32.940" style="s2">I just couldn&#39;t believe it I was like</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.589" end="00:48:33.599" style="s2">they&#39;re here already that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.940" end="00:48:37.020" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.599" end="00:48:40.470" style="s2">so I&#39;m also now training to be a</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.020" end="00:48:42.570" style="s2">volunteer firefighter so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.470" end="00:48:45.329" style="s2">something actually a few hours after</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.570" end="00:48:49.140" style="s2">this I&#39;m going to learn how to cut up</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.329" end="00:48:49.829" style="s2">cars so for for extraction Wow that&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.140" end="00:48:52.829" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.829" end="00:48:54.839" style="s2">so you know in addition to the food</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.829" end="00:48:57.240" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s building relationships</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.839" end="00:48:59.099" style="s2">when we live in a really small town talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.240" end="00:49:00.119" style="s2">to people talk to the neighbors doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.099" end="00:49:01.560" style="s2">mean I always get along with them</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.119" end="00:49:03.690" style="s2">they&#39;re also not necessarily on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.560" end="00:49:06.510" style="s2">localist vibe right like in a general</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.690" end="00:49:08.190" style="s2">sense it&#39;s it&#39;s present around here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.510" end="00:49:12.589" style="s2">kind of in the air at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.190" end="00:49:16.980" style="s2">everyone&#39;s part of this modernist era so</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.589" end="00:49:19.730" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s for me been just allowing</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.980" end="00:49:21.530" style="s2">myself to get a bit uncomfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.730" end="00:49:24.810" style="s2">talking to the people grow my food</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.530" end="00:49:27.720" style="s2">talking to the people around town you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.810" end="00:49:31.589" style="s2">know the the select the Board of</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.720" end="00:49:34.050" style="s2">Selectmen go in there talk to them the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.589" end="00:49:35.910" style="s2">cops go talk to them just literally talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.050" end="00:49:40.380" style="s2">to everybody that I can that&#39;s in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.910" end="00:49:43.200" style="s2">town and feel the push and pull and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.380" end="00:49:49.069" style="s2">also you know part of one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.200" end="00:49:50.760" style="s2">implications of complexity is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.069" end="00:49:52.290" style="s2">essentially in a complex system</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.760" end="00:49:54.030" style="s2">impossible to know how things will</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.290" end="00:49:54.510" style="s2">evolve the the predictability goes out</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.030" end="00:49:57.030" style="s2">the window</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.510" end="00:49:59.730" style="s2">so I&#39;m also in my personal kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.030" end="00:50:01.500" style="s2">localist endeavors I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.730" end="00:50:03.630" style="s2">fulfill one specific vision or one idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.500" end="00:50:07.079" style="s2">or one plan of what&#39;s gonna unfold I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.630" end="00:50:10.260" style="s2">allowing myself to be an agent in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.079" end="00:50:12.150" style="s2">larger system that&#39;s interacting having</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.260" end="00:50:13.290" style="s2">local micro interactions and seeing</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.150" end="00:50:14.940" style="s2">seeing what unfolds and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.290" end="00:50:16.290" style="s2">observing that and dislike volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.940" end="00:50:18.859" style="s2">firefighting thing is a perfect example</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.290" end="00:50:20.940" style="s2">that that was not part of the plan but</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.859" end="00:50:23.400" style="s2">you know they came to put out my fire</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.940" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">they were awesome guys they said you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.400" end="00:50:30.750" style="s2">ever thought about fighting fires I said</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:31.730" style="s2">now I&#39;m thinking about it so so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.750" end="00:50:35.859" style="s2">bit of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.730" end="00:50:38.030" style="s2">so that that&#39;s that&#39;s on me in general</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.859" end="00:50:40.820" style="s2">you know we have these issues we talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.030" end="00:50:42.859" style="s2">about long range connections building</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.820" end="00:50:44.090" style="s2">some of that down with with circuit</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.859" end="00:50:47.690" style="s2">breakers you mentioned boundaries and</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.090" end="00:50:50.600" style="s2">whatnot can de-risk us globally so that</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.690" end="00:50:55.160" style="s2">when failures happen they&#39;re bounded and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.600" end="00:51:00.470" style="s2">not sort of global in scale that means</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.160" end="00:51:03.080" style="s2">more decision-making brought home that</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.470" end="00:51:05.780" style="s2">means that that Town Hall matters it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.080" end="00:51:07.400" style="s2">not some extra thing and this is you</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.780" end="00:51:09.440" style="s2">know you mentioned I push back on</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.400" end="00:51:13.220" style="s2">nationalism this the issue with</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.440" end="00:51:15.140" style="s2">nationalism and you know obviously I</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:17.030" style="s2">don&#39;t want to do kind of worded thinking</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.140" end="00:51:19.490" style="s2">thing here where we&#39;re like Oh Nationals</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.030" end="00:51:22.700" style="s2">is bad because nationalism is bad but</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.490" end="00:51:24.320" style="s2">but as a general kind of connotation</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.700" end="00:51:27.020" style="s2">that comes along with it it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.320" end="00:51:28.609" style="s2">you know you either have globalism which</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.020" end="00:51:29.600" style="s2">says that the globe is the one system</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.609" end="00:51:32.660" style="s2">and we need to make decisions at that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.600" end="00:51:34.280" style="s2">scale and one interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.660" end="00:51:35.780" style="s2">nationalism is a similar thing just at</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.280" end="00:51:39.170" style="s2">the national scale sort of this one</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.780" end="00:51:41.660" style="s2">decision-making body but much like</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.170" end="00:51:43.130" style="s2">biological systems which we are we</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.660" end="00:51:45.170" style="s2">should be structured in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.130" end="00:51:48.170" style="s2">radiations of scale so it&#39;s natural to</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.170" end="00:51:51.590" style="s2">have things at a you know few hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.170" end="00:51:52.970" style="s2">people that&#39;s a unit now a few groups of</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.590" end="00:51:54.830" style="s2">a few hundred people that&#39;s another unit</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.970" end="00:51:56.540" style="s2">a few groups of those groups that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.830" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">another unit so this kind of nested</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.540" end="00:52:00.890" style="s2">scales sort of hierarchy of scales</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:02.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a very natural thing and and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.890" end="00:52:04.780" style="s2">the reason I push back on the word</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.960" end="00:52:07.369" style="s2">nationalism is so that doesn&#39;t get lost</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.780" end="00:52:08.930" style="s2">please you know every person is an</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.369" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">individual we kind of know and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.930" end="00:52:12.619" style="s2">understand that some individuals are</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:16.520" style="s2">similar to others but each everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.619" end="00:52:18.859" style="s2">unique places ought to add the same</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.520" end="00:52:23.300" style="s2">character they used to but we&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.859" end="00:52:25.190" style="s2">to modernize them so so once again a</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.300" end="00:52:26.930" style="s2">place kind of she have a feel should</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.190" end="00:52:30.560" style="s2">have a personality should kind of be</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.930" end="00:52:33.500" style="s2">quote/unquote somebody and so so</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.560" end="00:52:35.150" style="s2">localism is also about that that letting</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.500" end="00:52:38.500" style="s2">letting a place have its character and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.150" end="00:52:38.500" style="s2">find its character</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.369" end="00:52:44.049" style="s2">also the fact that you know when you put</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.160" end="00:52:46.390" style="s2">your money into something where does it</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.049" end="00:52:48.880" style="s2">go well guess what if it goes straight</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.390" end="00:52:51.910" style="s2">down the street to my to my neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.880" end="00:52:54.460" style="s2">who&#39;s farming his farm gets better now</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.910" end="00:52:55.720" style="s2">when I Drive up the street that&#39;s a more</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.460" end="00:52:59.559" style="s2">pleasant drive so there&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.720" end="00:53:02.710" style="s2">local effect of the the capital</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.559" end="00:53:03.849" style="s2">circulating very locally that that can</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.710" end="00:53:06.730" style="s2">engage is kind of positive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.849" end="00:53:07.990" style="s2">loops and then you know once we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.730" end="00:53:09.670" style="s2">overflowing with abundance in my</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.990" end="00:53:12.999" style="s2">neighborhood then we&#39;re able to not only</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.670" end="00:53:14.200" style="s2">feed ourselves but to help our you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.999" end="00:53:18.970" style="s2">the next town over or something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.200" end="00:53:21.009" style="s2">that when they&#39;re in need so localism is</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.970" end="00:53:23.049" style="s2">all about that what&#39;s the proper scale</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.009" end="00:53:24.519" style="s2">the decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.049" end="00:53:26.049" style="s2">what&#39;s the density of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.519" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">interconnections and interdependencies</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.049" end="00:53:33.609" style="s2">among people that live physically near</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:37.150" style="s2">one another so in this case I see a</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.609" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">localism as rather than a sort of you</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.150" end="00:53:39.490" style="s2">know it&#39;s just making things less</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:41.650" style="s2">complex or more complex or some like</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.490" end="00:53:43.630" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually reducing complexity</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.650" end="00:53:46.450" style="s2">at these very large scales global scales</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.630" end="00:53:48.700" style="s2">nation state scales but increasing that</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.450" end="00:53:52.690" style="s2">code that that complexity and that</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.700" end="00:53:56.019" style="s2">interdependence very locally so that in</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.690" end="00:53:58.029" style="s2">fact the local situation does look more</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.019" end="00:53:59.650" style="s2">like a single organism and you could</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.029" end="00:54:01.809" style="s2">have that cascade failure in that local</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.650" end="00:54:05.249" style="s2">organism then but it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.809" end="00:54:05.249" style="s2">spread the same way</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.690" end="00:54:09.590" style="s2">what else what else that&#39;s fat I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.940" end="00:54:12.110" style="s2">that that&#39;s absolutely fascinating to me</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.590" end="00:54:14.900" style="s2">it struck me as you were talking that</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.110" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a sign of our times it takes</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.900" end="00:54:18.800" style="s2">effort to do things the old right way</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:21.380" style="s2">yes and it&#39;s easy to do things the new</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.800" end="00:54:23.270" style="s2">bad way yeah you know having to relearn</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.380" end="00:54:25.640" style="s2">how to farm but that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.270" end="00:54:27.560" style="s2">an insane thing to say but that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.640" end="00:54:29.630" style="s2">where we are we&#39;re even learning a hat</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.560" end="00:54:32.300" style="s2">needing to relearn how to make local</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.630" end="00:54:34.010" style="s2">social connection yep how to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.300" end="00:54:36.170" style="s2">involved with other people and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.010" end="00:54:38.750" style="s2">also relearning the value of getting</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.170" end="00:54:41.240" style="s2">involved locally you know if you want a</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.750" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">really great contemporary example if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.240" end="00:54:46.370" style="s2">don&#39;t go to your PTA meeting then one</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:48.680" style="s2">day you will wake up and in your</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.380" end="00:54:57.410" style="s2">are innately and in in incurably racist</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.460" end="00:54:59.810" style="s2">and that they should throw themselves on</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.410" end="00:55:01.790" style="s2">the floor at the at the feet of critical</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.810" end="00:55:03.530" style="s2">theory and I you this it&#39;s a sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.790" end="00:55:05.060" style="s2">exaggerated example but it&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.530" end="00:55:06.350" style="s2">a hundred percent applicable if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.060" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">don&#39;t go to your local meetings if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.350" end="00:55:09.410" style="s2">don&#39;t go to the town hall if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:11.960" style="s2">vote in your local elections then people</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.410" end="00:55:15.020" style="s2">who do go are gonna make decisions for</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.960" end="00:55:17.060" style="s2">you and you may or may not like that and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.020" end="00:55:18.860" style="s2">the other than James Lindsay in our</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.060" end="00:55:21.080" style="s2">podcast that I did with him he really</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.860" end="00:55:24.170" style="s2">pointed that out to me as a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.080" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">some of this issue all the macro yelling</p>

<p begin="00:55:34.460" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">and cook meetings and raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.070" end="00:55:39.770" style="s2">because guess what they&#39;ll probably be</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:41.240" style="s2">other people there that wish they had</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.770" end="00:55:43.340" style="s2">the balls to step up and they&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.500" end="00:56:04.580" style="s2">that I was struck by when you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.910" end="00:56:07.910" style="s2">talking is that home is is how would you</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.580" end="00:56:10.430" style="s2">rate this homogeneity seems to be anti</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.910" end="00:56:12.470" style="s2">adaptive right like you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.430" end="00:56:14.480" style="s2">putting all the same in all the</p>

<p begin="00:56:26.590" end="00:56:32.490" style="s2">about that I mean that&#39;s just absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.330" end="00:56:35.050" style="s2">correct the thing is evolution works by</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.490" end="00:56:37.000" style="s2">variety production of variety and then</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.050" end="00:56:38.859" style="s2">selection and then sort of continuous</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.910" end="00:56:56.920" style="s2">Theory called the law of requisite</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.160" end="00:57:08.470" style="s2">environment so that it can respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.810" end="00:57:10.690" style="s2">this is exactly that issue that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.470" end="00:57:12.220" style="s2">fascinating we&#39;ve seen evolution and</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.890" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">was in undergrad in the 90s it was the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.020" end="00:57:55.390" style="s2">tail end there just just after the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:58.660" style="s2">of the Cold War and I wrote my my my</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.390" end="00:58:01.090" style="s2">thesis on you know the the necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.660" end="00:58:02.859" style="s2">competition for economic systems right</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.090" end="00:58:05.290" style="s2">so that we could see what works and what</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.859" end="00:58:07.420" style="s2">doesn&#39;t and you know I saw the communist</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.290" end="00:58:09.340" style="s2">capitalist competition and we saw who</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.420" end="00:58:12.790" style="s2">won but you know when we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.340" end="00:58:15.070" style="s2">anything else in no variety I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.790" end="00:58:17.050" style="s2">how we can select further and just one</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.070" end="00:58:18.700" style="s2">little other tangent I was watching a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.050" end="00:58:21.820" style="s2">documentary last night on the font</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.700" end="00:58:23.560" style="s2">Helvetica and it was amazing to see how</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.820" end="00:58:25.630" style="s2">in this design community Helvetica</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.560" end="00:58:28.060" style="s2">became like the most popularly used font</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.630" end="00:58:29.590" style="s2">in the world and it be they some of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.060" end="00:58:29.970" style="s2">guys in that world thought that like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.590" end="00:58:33.300" style="s2">hell</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.970" end="00:58:35.730" style="s2">was like the final evolution of font</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.300" end="00:58:37.290" style="s2">right and so they&#39;re like what do we do</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.730" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">next they even there was even like an</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.290" end="00:58:40.710" style="s2">anti Helvetica movement where they</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:41.760" style="s2">treaded it apart and tried to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.710" end="00:58:43.740" style="s2">somewhere else but then there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.760" end="00:58:46.080" style="s2">return to it so it&#39;s just interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.740" end="00:58:48.359" style="s2">parallel that we&#39;re seeing and all these</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.080" end="00:58:49.859" style="s2">things it almost makes you think that</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.359" end="00:58:51.450" style="s2">we&#39;re all connected and that we all kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.859" end="00:58:54.930" style="s2">of come from the same and when I say we</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.450" end="00:58:57.590" style="s2">I mean the earth the galaxy the universe</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.930" end="00:58:59.760" style="s2">us our DNA our cells our biological</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.590" end="00:59:03.090" style="s2">systems they all seem to have similar</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.760" end="00:59:04.890" style="s2">themes right so like we&#39;re all we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.090" end="00:59:06.630" style="s2">if people said well we&#39;re all just</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.890" end="00:59:08.940" style="s2">Stardust it&#39;s actually kind of true</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.630" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">right the DNA for the universe might be</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.940" end="00:59:12.119" style="s2">just the same as the DNA for us what do</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:13.470" style="s2">you think about that I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.119" end="00:59:15.780" style="s2">precisely but you understand what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.470" end="00:59:18.990" style="s2">saying so I mean it&#39;s pretty clear that</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.780" end="00:59:22.349" style="s2">we are all in the same world and and we</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.990" end="00:59:26.220" style="s2">are of the world we come out of it at</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.349" end="00:59:27.240" style="s2">risk of getting to to kind of woowoo you</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.220" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">know Alan Watts</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.240" end="00:59:31.680" style="s2">if you&#39;re familiar talk about how the</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:34.349" style="s2">universe peoples like an apple tree</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.680" end="00:59:35.670" style="s2">apples I think that&#39;s a good visual of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.349" end="00:59:42.900" style="s2">kind of how that goes</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.670" end="00:59:45.000" style="s2">so so what we share is not some code or</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.900" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">or you know we&#39;re not I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.000" end="00:59:49.830" style="s2">we&#39;re in a simulation or anything like</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:52.680" style="s2">that but rather these kind of principles</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.830" end="00:59:54.150" style="s2">of pattern formation and there-there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.680" end="00:59:55.560" style="s2">these and this is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.150" end="00:59:58.349" style="s2">that I was drawn to complexity in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.560" end="01:00:01.260" style="s2">first place is that it&#39;s that you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.349" end="01:00:04.020" style="s2">this rich variety out of a few</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.260" end="01:00:05.010" style="s2">fundamental principles of how patterns</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.020" end="01:00:07.320" style="s2">come into being</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.010" end="01:00:09.150" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the opposite of the law</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.320" end="01:00:12.230" style="s2">of entropy right entropy is about</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.150" end="01:00:15.000" style="s2">patterns disappearing it&#39;s about things</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.230" end="01:00:16.859" style="s2">disintegrating but what we observe in</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.000" end="01:00:19.560" style="s2">the world is not just that but patterns</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.859" end="01:00:20.460" style="s2">forming patterns growing and I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.560" end="01:00:24.510" style="s2">that some of these issues and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.460" end="01:00:27.690" style="s2">talking about you know boundaries and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.510" end="01:00:29.550" style="s2">borders these are some of the basic</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.690" end="01:00:31.140" style="s2">pattern elements that you see over and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.550" end="01:00:32.849" style="s2">over and over again no matter what kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.140" end="01:00:34.170" style="s2">of a system you&#39;re looking at so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.849" end="01:00:37.609" style="s2">clearly some principles at play here</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.170" end="01:00:40.710" style="s2">that we can we can look to and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.609" end="01:00:42.660" style="s2">it&#39;s in the calm</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.710" end="01:00:46.109" style="s2">nations of those principles and those</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.660" end="01:00:48.599" style="s2">patterns that you get this essentially</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.109" end="01:00:51.270" style="s2">infinite variety of possibilities so</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.599" end="01:00:55.080" style="s2">there&#39;s this there&#39;s this deep uniting</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.270" end="01:00:58.050" style="s2">set of pattern principles that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.080" end="01:00:59.730" style="s2">everything obeys because if it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.050" end="01:01:02.250" style="s2">the thing would fall apart that wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.730" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">exist and then there&#39;s the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.250" end="01:01:10.260" style="s2">when you recombine these things the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:14.730" style="s2">novelty is endless mmm something came to</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.260" end="01:01:16.470" style="s2">mind just now boundaries and health we</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.730" end="01:01:20.580" style="s2">even see that in personal relationships</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.470" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">in emotional relationships right like if</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.580" end="01:01:25.109" style="s2">you don&#39;t have boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:27.720" style="s2">emotionally between you and your spouse</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.109" end="01:01:30.119" style="s2">or you and your friends or just random</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.720" end="01:01:33.660" style="s2">people on the street that disrupts your</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.119" end="01:01:35.609" style="s2">own internal emotional thermostat right</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.660" end="01:01:38.220" style="s2">like you can get out of whack if you</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.609" end="01:01:39.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have a boundary and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.220" end="01:01:41.430" style="s2">have to be mean or anything but you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.900" end="01:01:43.349" style="s2">just like say no I&#39;m not comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.430" end="01:01:46.920" style="s2">with that or no that&#39;s just not for me</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.349" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">and it&#39;s fascinating to me to see that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.920" end="01:01:51.810" style="s2">even in just the the noises we make with</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:54.300" style="s2">our throats and the telepathy that we do</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.810" end="01:01:56.420" style="s2">it&#39;s like we need to have a boundary</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.300" end="01:01:58.830" style="s2">there too right there&#39;s boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.420" end="01:02:00.359" style="s2">everywhere and in fact if you really</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.830" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">think about it since we&#39;re both most</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.359" end="01:02:05.070" style="s2">mostly made up of space right in our</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.119" end="01:02:06.510" style="s2">atoms in our construction or molecular</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.070" end="01:02:09.119" style="s2">construction really we are just a</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.510" end="01:02:11.339" style="s2">boundary around space even just</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.119" end="01:02:13.890" style="s2">physically in our manifestation to the</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.339" end="01:02:15.900" style="s2">world I just love seeing how all these</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.890" end="01:02:17.550" style="s2">things come together one of my favorite</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.900" end="01:02:19.589" style="s2">things might well I think when my top</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.550" end="01:02:21.480" style="s2">skills I test out at is ideation and</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.589" end="01:02:24.390" style="s2">just being able to see how everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.480" end="01:02:25.800" style="s2">fits together and identify patterns but</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.390" end="01:02:27.119" style="s2">when one thing you just mentioned that</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.800" end="01:02:29.580" style="s2">struck me really was</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.119" end="01:02:34.290" style="s2">you said entropy versus pattern creation</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.580" end="01:02:36.030" style="s2">now I&#39;m not a physicist but isn&#39;t some</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.290" end="01:02:39.630" style="s2">lob of entropy isn&#39;t that like a</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.030" end="01:02:42.180" style="s2">universal law like physics second law of</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.630" end="01:02:45.260" style="s2">thermodynamics is yeah entropy is always</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.180" end="01:02:48.359" style="s2">increasing okay in an isolated system</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.260" end="01:02:50.670" style="s2">what we observe are not isolated systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.359" end="01:02:52.170" style="s2">we observe open systems so all of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.670" end="01:02:54.329" style="s2">physics that follows from isolated</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.170" end="01:02:56.339" style="s2">systems we started applying</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.329" end="01:02:58.349" style="s2">sort of liberally to the world at large</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.339" end="01:03:00.479" style="s2">and it turns out that most of the things</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.349" end="01:03:02.699" style="s2">in the world are indeed not isolated at</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.479" end="01:03:04.170" style="s2">all and even to develop those theories</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.699" end="01:03:06.900" style="s2">of isolated systems what did people have</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.170" end="01:03:09.539" style="s2">to do they had to create crazy like</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.900" end="01:03:11.429" style="s2">contrived experimental situations so</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.539" end="01:03:13.410" style="s2">that a system could be more or less</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.429" end="01:03:15.749" style="s2">isolated not really but you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.410" end="01:03:18.929" style="s2">got like insulated surfaces and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.749" end="01:03:20.849" style="s2">so open systems are what we actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.929" end="01:03:22.709" style="s2">deal with in the world and the second</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.849" end="01:03:27.650" style="s2">law of thermodynamics has not much to</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.709" end="01:03:30.660" style="s2">say about those so so then when people</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.650" end="01:03:32.429" style="s2">say yeah but in general like in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.660" end="01:03:34.289" style="s2">whole universe it&#39;s going towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.429" end="01:03:36.179" style="s2">entropy that&#39;s actually making an</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.289" end="01:03:38.009" style="s2">assertion about the structure of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.179" end="01:03:40.349" style="s2">universe that I don&#39;t think anyone is</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.009" end="01:03:43.549" style="s2">able to make with any confidence you</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.349" end="01:03:46.289" style="s2">know you can you can feel more or less</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.549" end="01:03:48.299" style="s2">compelled by a particular model of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.289" end="01:03:50.759" style="s2">universe but the idea that that debate</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.299" end="01:03:52.439" style="s2">is is over is absurd of course what</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.759" end="01:03:54.209" style="s2">there&#39;s only one universe where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.439" end="01:03:55.829" style="s2">closed system yeah that we know any or</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.209" end="01:03:56.880" style="s2">that we can make any claim like that and</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.829" end="01:03:59.160" style="s2">feel like we know what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:01.170" style="s2">about obviously we can build models test</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.160" end="01:04:02.789" style="s2">the predictions of those models and feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.170" end="01:04:03.229" style="s2">more or less confident but that&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.789" end="01:04:06.479" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.229" end="01:04:09.179" style="s2">so how radical of an idea is it to say</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.479" end="01:04:11.459" style="s2">that the second law of thermo-dynamics</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.179" end="01:04:13.859" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t apply to our closed systems</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.459" end="01:04:16.890" style="s2">that we operate in is that that radical</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.859" end="01:04:18.599" style="s2">is that widely accepted it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.890" end="01:04:21.529" style="s2">widely accepted that open systems you</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.599" end="01:04:27.359" style="s2">need something else theoretically that</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.529" end="01:04:30.299" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t apply is I I think that it</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.359" end="01:04:33.029" style="s2">does apply but under those very specific</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.299" end="01:04:35.759" style="s2">conditions of isolation okay so when you</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.029" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">you know if I stop maintaining my house</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.759" end="01:04:42.539" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna fall apart okay and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:44.849" style="s2">not because it&#39;s strongly isolated but</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.539" end="01:04:47.429" style="s2">because the kinds of inputs it needs</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.849" end="01:04:48.059" style="s2">will not be there anymore to maintain</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.429" end="01:04:50.489" style="s2">its form</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.059" end="01:04:53.039" style="s2">are there gradations of open and closed</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.489" end="01:04:54.929" style="s2">systems if we move towards a more open</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.039" end="01:04:56.939" style="s2">system with long-range connections and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.929" end="01:05:00.329" style="s2">stuff like that does that increase does</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.939" end="01:05:01.559" style="s2">that increase entropy so okay let me</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.329" end="01:05:02.400" style="s2">think about this for a minute so so one</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.559" end="01:05:03.660" style="s2">of the things I want to mention it</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.400" end="01:05:06.239" style="s2">connected back to what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.660" end="01:05:08.369" style="s2">about is that we&#39;re talk about</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.239" end="01:05:10.290" style="s2">boundaries you were talking about</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.369" end="01:05:12.660" style="s2">you know making sure that not everything</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.290" end="01:05:16.200" style="s2">goes through kind of boundary but living</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.660" end="01:05:18.270" style="s2">boundaries are selectively permeable so</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.200" end="01:05:21.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not about things go in or they</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.270" end="01:05:23.369" style="s2">don&#39;t it&#39;s about that the the agent or</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.359" end="01:05:26.100" style="s2">the system is making decisions about</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.369" end="01:05:27.840" style="s2">what comes in and what doesn&#39;t so that</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.100" end="01:05:29.190" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s really important</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.840" end="01:05:31.710" style="s2">about think about boundaries cuz because</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.190" end="01:05:33.540" style="s2">if you have a boundary around something</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.710" end="01:05:35.220" style="s2">and nothing gets in then indeed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.540" end="01:05:36.540" style="s2">you&#39;ll get the second second law will</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.220" end="01:05:39.630" style="s2">take over you&#39;ll get nothing but entropy</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.540" end="01:05:41.580" style="s2">so you have to take in something yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.630" end="01:05:44.010" style="s2">so a lot of these questions revolve</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.580" end="01:05:47.070" style="s2">around what are those decisions who</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.010" end="01:05:48.750" style="s2">makes them and then and then what</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.070" end="01:05:49.590" style="s2">follows from those and you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.750" end="01:05:50.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve nailed it the earlier you</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.590" end="01:05:53.250" style="s2">mentioned something like a high trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.700" end="01:05:54.869" style="s2">inside and that&#39;s exactly like a cell on</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.250" end="01:05:56.400" style="s2">your body is able to kind of trust</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.869" end="01:05:58.470" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside of the membrane</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.400" end="01:06:00.570" style="s2">and it has less trust about what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.470" end="01:06:02.250" style="s2">on outside the membrane and you know it</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.570" end="01:06:04.020" style="s2">might it might decide that you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.250" end="01:06:07.380" style="s2">you&#39;re a viral particle and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.020" end="01:06:08.910" style="s2">to let you in so so I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.380" end="01:06:10.320" style="s2">that&#39;s really important it&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.910" end="01:06:11.700" style="s2">not that boundaries are for pure</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.320" end="01:06:16.100" style="s2">isolation it&#39;s that they&#39;re for a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.700" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">selective interaction mm discriminant</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.100" end="01:06:22.140" style="s2">strategic disconnection the end of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:23.490" style="s2">age of indiscriminate connection you may</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.140" end="01:06:25.650" style="s2">not have an answer to this so I</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.490" end="01:06:28.950" style="s2">apologize if I&#39;m putting you out there</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.650" end="01:06:31.010" style="s2">but do you know in the history and just</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.950" end="01:06:33.750" style="s2">literature that you&#39;ve studied like</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.010" end="01:06:35.609" style="s2">where this idea that it was okay or a</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.750" end="01:06:37.020" style="s2">good idea to just reach out and reach</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.609" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">out and reach out and connect and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.020" end="01:06:41.460" style="s2">connect and connect and connect where</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:43.650" style="s2">did that come from you know like how it</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.460" end="01:06:46.890" style="s2">seems to me like that&#39;s a fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.650" end="01:06:48.660" style="s2">grand strategic error and yet somehow it</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.890" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">seemed to have been driving everything</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.660" end="01:06:54.330" style="s2">was it just emergent was it just what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:56.100" style="s2">had to do in order to find that boundary</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.330" end="01:06:57.810" style="s2">and decide to pull Berger you know where</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.100" end="01:07:00.359" style="s2">the batter should be and decide to pull</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.810" end="01:07:03.270" style="s2">back or become more selective with who</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.359" end="01:07:04.680" style="s2">passes through the membrane because I</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.270" end="01:07:06.390" style="s2">don&#39;t know here is this not like a</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.680" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">general theme out there right now like</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.390" end="01:07:09.900" style="s2">oh we need to be more selectively</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:12.030" style="s2">disconnected okay great</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.900" end="01:07:14.550" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna take decades to change that</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.030" end="01:07:16.500" style="s2">boat around but do you have any idea</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.550" end="01:07:18.630" style="s2">like just with talking to your dad or</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.500" end="01:07:19.920" style="s2">who knows what like just in your past</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.630" end="01:07:21.360" style="s2">experience of where you</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.920" end="01:07:22.800" style="s2">you could see this coming from I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.360" end="01:07:24.840" style="s2">have the answer I&#39;m just curious well I</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.800" end="01:07:28.860" style="s2">mean I&#39;m no historian but I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.840" end="01:07:30.330" style="s2">look at history and you see that with</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.860" end="01:07:32.010" style="s2">increasing connect</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.330" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">I mean increasing connectivity for</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.010" end="01:07:36.420" style="s2">humans physically is related to</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:38.280" style="s2">increased speed of transportation and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.420" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">you get these local competitive</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.280" end="01:07:43.770" style="s2">advantages if I&#39;m able to bring in a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.280" end="01:07:45.180" style="s2">of metal from from a distant land and</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.770" end="01:07:47.010" style="s2">create weapons out of that I have a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.180" end="01:07:49.350" style="s2">distinct advantage or if I&#39;m people even</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.010" end="01:07:51.660" style="s2">just able to trade easily you know on</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.350" end="01:07:54.060" style="s2">the Silk Road or something or getting</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.660" end="01:07:57.060" style="s2">spices you know so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.060" end="01:08:01.530" style="s2">obviously these benefits to long-range</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.060" end="01:08:03.270" style="s2">connections and I my sense is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.530" end="01:08:04.950" style="s2">just something we never reflected on we</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.270" end="01:08:06.690" style="s2">just kind of kept going kept going and</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.950" end="01:08:08.520" style="s2">so I think there&#39;s two things there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.690" end="01:08:10.620" style="s2">long range connections and and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.520" end="01:08:13.940" style="s2">centralization I&#39;m more confident to say</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.620" end="01:08:18.810" style="s2">that the kind of centralization that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.940" end="01:08:21.030" style="s2">default to today is if not generated</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.810" end="01:08:23.580" style="s2">from at least extremely kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.030" end="01:08:26.280" style="s2">catalyzed by exasperated by the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.580" end="01:08:28.320" style="s2">Industrial Revolution where you were</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.280" end="01:08:30.720" style="s2">focused on repeatable processes that</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.320" end="01:08:33.810" style="s2">could be scaled up and and workers that</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.720" end="01:08:35.910" style="s2">could be changed out and be fungible in</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.810" end="01:08:40.110" style="s2">kind of be parts of a of a large machine</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.910" end="01:08:43.200" style="s2">type of vision so I think I think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.110" end="01:08:45.090" style="s2">those two things are distinct but</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.200" end="01:08:47.970" style="s2">related the long-range connections in</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.090" end="01:08:51.720" style="s2">the centralization of and scaling up of</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.970" end="01:08:53.400" style="s2">processes what&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.720" end="01:08:55.170" style="s2">conversation with Jordan Hall about this</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.400" end="01:08:57.540" style="s2">a number of times talking about how he</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.170" end="01:09:00.330" style="s2">calls a game a and game B societies and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.540" end="01:09:03.510" style="s2">game a Society was basically scaling up</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.330" end="01:09:04.950" style="s2">of our hunter-gatherer tribe and inside</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.510" end="01:09:07.050" style="s2">the hunter-gatherer tribe there probably</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.950" end="01:09:09.240" style="s2">is some element of centralization and</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.050" end="01:09:11.580" style="s2">it&#39;s even probably like communist in</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.240" end="01:09:12.900" style="s2">some ways and it&#39;s like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.580" end="01:09:14.250" style="s2">gonna decide to do this we&#39;re all gonna</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.900" end="01:09:16.500" style="s2">go do that and then we&#39;re gonna share</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.250" end="01:09:18.030" style="s2">this stuff around even if you it scales</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.500" end="01:09:19.590" style="s2">all the way down if you&#39;ve read sex at</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.030" end="01:09:21.330" style="s2">dawn it scales down into even like</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.590" end="01:09:23.580" style="s2">sexual relationships and whatnot</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.330" end="01:09:26.100" style="s2">according to some people but basically</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.580" end="01:09:28.020" style="s2">game a has us scaling that up</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.100" end="01:09:30.390" style="s2">to a point now where it just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.020" end="01:09:31.860" style="s2">bucket more it just doesn&#39;t work right I</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.390" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">don&#39;t know why we thought something that</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.860" end="01:09:36.240" style="s2">would work for 30 people is gonna work</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">for 300 million people or 7 billion</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.240" end="01:09:40.140" style="s2">people and some people have their way</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:42.150" style="s2">right and so what he has described is</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.140" end="01:09:43.770" style="s2">the evolution now of game B he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.150" end="01:09:46.380" style="s2">know what it is just yet nobody really</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.770" end="01:09:49.770" style="s2">does but it is based on a themes of</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.380" end="01:09:51.210" style="s2">decentralization localization emergence</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.770" end="01:09:53.730" style="s2">and when you combine that with</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.210" end="01:09:57.930" style="s2">technology then it becomes you can now</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.730" end="01:10:00.150" style="s2">create the tribe that you miss from from</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.930" end="01:10:03.300" style="s2">the old days with people that share your</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.150" end="01:10:05.670" style="s2">values not just the people that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.300" end="01:10:07.950" style="s2">nearby you right and so we&#39;re starting</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.670" end="01:10:11.580" style="s2">to be able to form communities based on</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.950" end="01:10:14.850" style="s2">values irrespective of where you are</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.580" end="01:10:16.770" style="s2">physically and that is a major major</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.850" end="01:10:18.900" style="s2">change for us because not only does that</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.770" end="01:10:20.850" style="s2">mean you can find your tribesmen you may</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.900" end="01:10:22.170" style="s2">be in California but it also means</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.850" end="01:10:24.660" style="s2">you&#39;re actually living next door to</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.170" end="01:10:27.150" style="s2">people who may not be in your tribe - so</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.660" end="01:10:28.620" style="s2">what do you think about that and and are</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.150" end="01:10:30.750" style="s2">you&#39;re participating and that&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.620" end="01:10:33.210" style="s2">degree - aren&#39;t you oh oh yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.750" end="01:10:35.880" style="s2">absolutely so I think that like to your</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.210" end="01:10:37.350" style="s2">later point that you might be living</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.880" end="01:10:41.450" style="s2">next to people that work in a different</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.350" end="01:10:43.530" style="s2">tribe there&#39;s real problems with this</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.450" end="01:10:45.450" style="s2">you&#39;re getting this kind of we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.530" end="01:10:47.160" style="s2">sorting out spatially we&#39;re sorting out</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.450" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">my values virtually and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.160" end="01:10:50.640" style="s2">sorting out spatially so what are those</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:52.650" style="s2">relationships now with your neighbors I</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.640" end="01:10:55.170" style="s2">think one of the important things though</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.650" end="01:10:57.090" style="s2">to recognize about localism is that</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.170" end="01:10:58.830" style="s2">you&#39;re not always gonna be best friends</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.090" end="01:11:00.780" style="s2">with your neighbor even in the best case</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.830" end="01:11:03.330" style="s2">scenario it&#39;s just not realistic</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.780" end="01:11:06.210" style="s2">you know GK Chesterton talked about this</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.330" end="01:11:09.480" style="s2">and it talked about how you know often</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.210" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s portrayed that the the city is</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.480" end="01:11:13.020" style="s2">sort of you know it&#39;s a cosmopolitan</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:15.870" style="s2">everything&#39;s there this massive variety</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.020" end="01:11:17.310" style="s2">and the countryside is some you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.870" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">homogenous place where everyone&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.310" end="01:11:21.660" style="s2">same and from the experience of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.920" end="01:11:23.940" style="s2">individual it couldn&#39;t be more opposite</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.660" end="01:11:25.890" style="s2">because when you&#39;re in the city you can</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.940" end="01:11:27.330" style="s2">seek out those like-minded people you</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.890" end="01:11:29.190" style="s2">know you get together once a week though</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.330" end="01:11:31.140" style="s2">that&#39;s your crew where you&#39;re all see</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.190" end="01:11:33.210" style="s2">things the same way in the country</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.140" end="01:11:34.290" style="s2">there&#39;s no one to choose from so you</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.210" end="01:11:38.120" style="s2">better learn to get along with whoever</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.290" end="01:11:41.180" style="s2">the hell&#39;s out there or move so</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.120" end="01:11:42.620" style="s2">so there&#39;s a bit of you know I think for</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.180" end="01:11:46.920" style="s2">this kind of localized vision to come</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.620" end="01:11:48.420" style="s2">come you have to be realized</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.920" end="01:11:51.150" style="s2">has to be some willingness for people to</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.420" end="01:11:53.850" style="s2">get up and move around and then move</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.150" end="01:11:56.929" style="s2">around less after that I think there</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.850" end="01:11:59.580" style="s2">also has to be sort of large-scale</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.929" end="01:12:01.790" style="s2">assurances on the ability to get up and</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.580" end="01:12:04.410" style="s2">leave a place I&#39;ve met something that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.790" end="01:12:05.820" style="s2">does deserve to be a large-scale shared</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.410" end="01:12:08.280" style="s2">value that you shouldn&#39;t be trapped</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.820" end="01:12:12.929" style="s2">somewhere physically held in you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.280" end="01:12:14.900" style="s2">like in North Korea or something but and</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.929" end="01:12:17.250" style="s2">the reason being so that if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.900" end="01:12:18.630" style="s2">make sense in a place or place doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.250" end="01:12:22.410" style="s2">make sense to you you go find the place</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.630" end="01:12:23.520" style="s2">that does make sense so so there&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.410" end="01:12:27.989" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of both I think that needs</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.520" end="01:12:29.460" style="s2">to happen one is that we figure out</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.989" end="01:12:32.070" style="s2">where we should go and get up and move</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.460" end="01:12:34.199" style="s2">around a bit and to learn how to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.070" end="01:12:35.090" style="s2">neighbors again and learn that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.199" end="01:12:38.160" style="s2">isn&#39;t always pretty</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.090" end="01:12:39.929" style="s2">right and you know good good walls make</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.160" end="01:12:43.440" style="s2">good neighbors yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.929" end="01:12:47.580" style="s2">truism for a reason interesting comment</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.440" end="01:12:50.969" style="s2">there on mobility one of the assumptions</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.580" end="01:12:56.219" style="s2">in globalization is that labour mobility</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.969" end="01:13:00.210" style="s2">is perfect and even within the global</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.219" end="01:13:01.890" style="s2">economy and also domestically and what</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.210" end="01:13:05.310" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen actually is that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.890" end="01:13:08.010" style="s2">true and that labor labor mobility is</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.310" end="01:13:10.440" style="s2">not perfect and that when you do ship</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.010" end="01:13:12.690" style="s2">out capital and you do ship out products</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.440" end="01:13:14.429" style="s2">and services and businesses away people</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.690" end="01:13:16.469" style="s2">like to stay where they are where their</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.429" end="01:13:17.910" style="s2">family is where their community is where</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.469" end="01:13:20.489" style="s2">they were born I never thought they</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.910" end="01:13:22.590" style="s2">would leave so there there is some</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.489" end="01:13:24.330" style="s2">friction there and what you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.590" end="01:13:27.090" style="s2">about and and what&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.330" end="01:13:29.550" style="s2">globalism the the failure of labour</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.090" end="01:13:31.770" style="s2">mobility to be perfect is pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.550" end="01:13:33.570" style="s2">the fundamental failure of globalism</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.770" end="01:13:36.090" style="s2">besides the choke points and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.570" end="01:13:38.730" style="s2">strategic errors of manufacturing and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.090" end="01:13:41.340" style="s2">whatnot that people were just you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.730" end="01:13:43.380" style="s2">somehow their local space was fungible</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.340" end="01:13:45.239" style="s2">as you said earlier that they would just</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.380" end="01:13:47.460" style="s2">say a I lived in Youngstown Ohio</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.239" end="01:13:49.469" style="s2">my whole life but now I need to move to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.460" end="01:13:49.650" style="s2">Nogales Mexico all right it I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.469" end="01:13:51.710" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.650" end="01:13:55.410" style="s2">but no it just doesn&#39;t happen like that</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.710" end="01:13:56.480" style="s2">so there&#39;s an interesting element to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.410" end="01:13:59.300" style="s2">considered there when you</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.480" end="01:14:02.870" style="s2">talk about people needing to be free to</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.300" end="01:14:05.239" style="s2">move to find the right place there has</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.870" end="01:14:08.330" style="s2">to be a sort of freedom in ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.239" end="01:14:10.900" style="s2">also to allow that to happen I</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.330" end="01:14:14.150" style="s2">personally have been looking at at land</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.900" end="01:14:16.430" style="s2">like I&#39;ve been in DC for almost 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.150" end="01:14:18.500" style="s2">basically I love the living in the city</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.430" end="01:14:21.170" style="s2">I just use past tense man that&#39;s sad I</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.500" end="01:14:23.690" style="s2">love living in the city I&#39;m a city kid a</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.170" end="01:14:26.630" style="s2">boring a raised here grew up on the</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.690" end="01:14:28.250" style="s2">block like built institutions and real</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.630" end="01:14:30.260" style="s2">estate and communities in the city but</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.250" end="01:14:32.450" style="s2">I&#39;m coming to accept that this is</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.260" end="01:14:35.210" style="s2">probably not my place and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.450" end="01:14:37.550" style="s2">looking at acreage and basically I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.210" end="01:14:40.280" style="s2">called it Appalachia Stan like some</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.550" end="01:14:43.040" style="s2">stretch out there that that spans</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.280" end="01:14:45.080" style="s2">through Tennessee Kentucky Ohio Virginia</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.040" end="01:14:47.540" style="s2">West Virginia Pennsylvania up into New</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.080" end="01:14:49.760" style="s2">York though that seems to be that seems</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.540" end="01:14:51.920" style="s2">to be calling my name right now and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.760" end="01:14:53.630" style="s2">amount of acreage you can get it and the</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.920" end="01:14:55.720" style="s2">ability that we have these days to</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.630" end="01:14:58.220" style="s2">become ought to build off the grid and</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.720" end="01:14:59.930" style="s2">you know fit into the nature there</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.220" end="01:15:02.140" style="s2">rather than dominate it like these</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.930" end="01:15:04.580" style="s2">things are really attractive to me and</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.140" end="01:15:07.430" style="s2">you know combined what happened with</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.580" end="01:15:10.160" style="s2">Corona exploding for all of us to see</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.430" end="01:15:12.739" style="s2">that work can be done anywhere holy cow</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.160" end="01:15:14.960" style="s2">and that all this driving and commuting</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.739" end="01:15:16.850" style="s2">and water cooler and lunch that</p>

<p begin="01:15:18.290" end="01:15:22.670" style="s2">counterproductive so I think we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.900" end="01:15:25.160" style="s2">see an explosion in this type of</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.670" end="01:15:27.230" style="s2">thinking are you seeing that are you</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.160" end="01:15:30.530" style="s2">getting vibes like that too I mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.230" end="01:15:35.330" style="s2">however the last six months between</p>

<p begin="01:15:44.060" end="01:15:48.440" style="s2">getting vibes is it having changes are</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.610" end="01:15:48.860" style="s2">people being motivated to move and do</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.440" end="01:15:52.850" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.860" end="01:15:54.470" style="s2">I mean anecdotally yes a number of my</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.850" end="01:15:58.220" style="s2">friends just since this whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.470" end="01:16:01.700" style="s2">coronavirus thing started unfolding have</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.220" end="01:16:04.070" style="s2">moved from the Boston or surrounding</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.700" end="01:16:06.650" style="s2">towns into New Hampshire just like that</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.070" end="01:16:08.330" style="s2">you know during the lockdown shot the</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.650" end="01:16:10.340" style="s2">real estate bought their house said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.330" end="01:16:12.230" style="s2">getting the hell out of here</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.340" end="01:16:15.590" style="s2">in general I think large cities are</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.230" end="01:16:17.540" style="s2">going to keep being they&#39;re kind of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.590" end="01:16:19.040" style="s2">places that connect the globe right</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.540" end="01:16:20.360" style="s2">these large cities that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.040" end="01:16:23.810" style="s2">airports are that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.360" end="01:16:26.360" style="s2">connection they&#39;re gonna keep feeling</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.810" end="01:16:28.730" style="s2">these extreme events pretty hard I think</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.360" end="01:16:30.800" style="s2">as we go forward you know it&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.730" end="01:16:32.120" style="s2">things seem you know depending on how</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.800" end="01:16:33.740" style="s2">you think about it but seem unrelated</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.120" end="01:16:36.350" style="s2">yeah the coronavirus and you have these</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.740" end="01:16:38.630" style="s2">riots and stuff but this is like these</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.350" end="01:16:41.380" style="s2">are these are Cascades and there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.630" end="01:16:44.930" style="s2">to be more of them until we do</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.380" end="01:16:47.600" style="s2">disconnect a bit more and so are you you</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.930" end="01:16:49.820" style="s2">know could go on yeah and so for myself</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.600" end="01:16:52.970" style="s2">I mean like I said we&#39;ve been in our</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.820" end="01:16:55.640" style="s2">home for about two years now we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.970" end="01:16:57.500" style="s2">move here without this awareness I mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.640" end="01:16:59.420" style="s2">what&#39;s happening we sort looked around</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.500" end="01:17:00.710" style="s2">and say oh wow didn&#39;t we get lucky we</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.420" end="01:17:03.620" style="s2">said oh wow I&#39;m glad that we made that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.710" end="01:17:04.760" style="s2">decision now or when we did because look</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.620" end="01:17:09.940" style="s2">at what&#39;s happening now I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.760" end="01:17:11.780" style="s2">dealing with that so in my face um so</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.940" end="01:17:14.330" style="s2">you know part of the reason we were able</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.780" end="01:17:16.220" style="s2">to release that paper in January was</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.330" end="01:17:17.750" style="s2">because we weren&#39;t surprised by any of</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.220" end="01:17:23.630" style="s2">this we&#39;ve been sort of keeping our eye</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.750" end="01:17:26.210" style="s2">out we know this stuff is coming so but</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.630" end="01:17:29.270" style="s2">I think people do like urban settings</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.210" end="01:17:31.610" style="s2">density I think you&#39;re seeing more and</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.270" end="01:17:34.760" style="s2">more interest in kind of classical urban</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.610" end="01:17:37.550" style="s2">architecture walkable spaces fewer cars</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.760" end="01:17:39.530" style="s2">things like that what I think many</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.550" end="01:17:41.810" style="s2">people are going to start realizing is</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.530" end="01:17:43.850" style="s2">that you can have a lot of that and you</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.810" end="01:17:45.560" style="s2">can have the countryside and you can be</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.850" end="01:17:48.440" style="s2">in a little what I&#39;m calling micro City</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.560" end="01:17:50.510" style="s2">or on the edge of a micro City that</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.440" end="01:17:53.420" style="s2">you&#39;ve never heard of before and has you</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.510" end="01:17:56.000" style="s2">know let&#39;s say 40 restaurants and a few</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.420" end="01:17:58.010" style="s2">clubs or whatever it serve enough to get</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.000" end="01:17:59.780" style="s2">that what you get out of the city enough</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.010" end="01:18:04.310" style="s2">to get that out of it without being</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.780" end="01:18:07.640" style="s2">these massive sprawling see things see</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.310" end="01:18:10.490" style="s2">things sure yeah they sort of danger</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.640" end="01:18:11.930" style="s2">zones you know so so I&#39;m seeing I&#39;m kind</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.490" end="01:18:13.160" style="s2">of long on what I&#39;m calling my purse</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.930" end="01:18:14.480" style="s2">cities and especially especially</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.160" end="01:18:16.850" style="s2">especially where they&#39;re not surrounded</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.480" end="01:18:18.680" style="s2">by suburbia but actual countryside so</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.850" end="01:18:19.050" style="s2">that hard delineation between them none</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.680" end="01:18:21.719" style="s2">of that</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.050" end="01:18:23.820" style="s2">none of that in between stuff yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.719" end="01:18:27.449" style="s2">and I say this as like an avowed</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.820" end="01:18:29.610" style="s2">urbanist right like I love living in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.449" end="01:18:31.710" style="s2">city I love getting up and walking to</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.610" end="01:18:33.809" style="s2">the yoga studio going to my CrossFit gym</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.710" end="01:18:36.090" style="s2">getting coffee walking to work taking my</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.809" end="01:18:38.010" style="s2">kids to local park all the Arts all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.090" end="01:18:40.020" style="s2">anything but maybe at 30 years maybe</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.010" end="01:18:42.869" style="s2">I&#39;ve already maybe I&#39;ve chewed it all up</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.020" end="01:18:44.579" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see the the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.869" end="01:18:46.610" style="s2">land in West Virginia looks really</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.579" end="01:18:49.020" style="s2">appealing and it is beautiful and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.610" end="01:18:51.210" style="s2">can&#39;t go to Pennsylvania I can&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.020" end="01:18:52.860" style="s2">Virginia because I just don&#39;t their</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.210" end="01:18:54.780" style="s2">political future is a little too</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.860" end="01:18:58.190" style="s2">uncertain for me whereas I think West</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.780" end="01:19:00.090" style="s2">Virginia pretty sick seems pretty solid</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.190" end="01:19:01.920" style="s2">definitely in a place where they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.090" end="01:19:04.110" style="s2">call the cops on you for lifting weights</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.920" end="01:19:07.980" style="s2">in your front yard as has happened to me</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.110" end="01:19:10.440" style="s2">four times now in Washington DC you</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.980" end="01:19:13.079" style="s2">mentioned something about Cascades and</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.440" end="01:19:16.530" style="s2">cascading effects and there&#39;s a concept</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.079" end="01:19:21.349" style="s2">in complexity that I want to talk to you</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.530" end="01:19:23.699" style="s2">about self-organized criticality and I</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.349" end="01:19:26.460" style="s2">would give a primer but you can give the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.699" end="01:19:29.429" style="s2">primer but basically the idea is I want</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.460" end="01:19:31.949" style="s2">to understand how in this systems you</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.429" end="01:19:34.699" style="s2">know event how this is applying to us</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.949" end="01:19:38.130" style="s2">societally and if we can expect to see</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.699" end="01:19:40.650" style="s2">events like that so assume the audience</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.130" end="01:19:42.690" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know what it means and just give</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.650" end="01:19:44.429" style="s2">us a quick primer on it and see if we</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.690" end="01:19:48.510" style="s2">can relate it to like our current</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.429" end="01:19:50.369" style="s2">culture and cultural events sure so the</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.510" end="01:19:51.889" style="s2">classic model that&#39;s used to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.369" end="01:19:54.809" style="s2">this self-organized criticality</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.889" end="01:19:56.639" style="s2">quote-unquote is the sand pile model</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.809" end="01:19:58.800" style="s2">which is the idea that you build up you</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.639" end="01:20:00.210" style="s2">drop sand onto a pile and you keep</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.800" end="01:20:02.429" style="s2">dropping that sand and build up the pile</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.210" end="01:20:04.679" style="s2">over time as you&#39;re dropping more sand</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.429" end="01:20:06.690" style="s2">on to it you get avalanches around the</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.679" end="01:20:08.099" style="s2">pile those avalanches have different</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.690" end="01:20:10.619" style="s2">sizes sometimes it&#39;s a few grains of</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.099" end="01:20:12.000" style="s2">sand kind of tumbling down sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.619" end="01:20:14.489" style="s2">it&#39;s going the whole side of the pile</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.000" end="01:20:17.159" style="s2">will go so this huge avalanche so that</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.489" end="01:20:20.670" style="s2">that distribution of the sizes of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.159" end="01:20:22.860" style="s2">avalanche that&#39;s really the key marker</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.670" end="01:20:26.099" style="s2">of something is kind of in that critical</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.860" end="01:20:28.679" style="s2">range meaning that there&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.099" end="01:20:30.599" style="s2">sort of typical size to these things you</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.679" end="01:20:31.409" style="s2">have many many many many tiny avalanches</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.599" end="01:20:33.090" style="s2">a few great</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.409" end="01:20:34.590" style="s2">and then every once in a while you have</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.090" end="01:20:38.280" style="s2">a massive avalanche basically the whole</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.590" end="01:20:40.379" style="s2">pile goes right so I mean in turns out</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.280" end="01:20:43.590" style="s2">that sand piles are not modeled well</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.379" end="01:20:45.989" style="s2">this way ironically but other systems</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.590" end="01:20:49.079" style="s2">are including actual like snow</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.989" end="01:20:51.149" style="s2">avalanches and this is why you get you</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.079" end="01:20:52.469" style="s2">know all the time little bits of snow or</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.149" end="01:20:54.510" style="s2">trickling down the hill it&#39;s no big deal</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.469" end="01:21:00.119" style="s2">every once in a while something triggers</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.510" end="01:21:01.619" style="s2">and the whole hillside goes and so</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.119" end="01:21:02.519" style="s2">another another distinction that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.619" end="01:21:05.159" style="s2">relate to things we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.519" end="01:21:07.499" style="s2">about between how you characterize</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.159" end="01:21:11.550" style="s2">systems one our systems with a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.499" end="01:21:13.469" style="s2">characteristic scale meaning that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.550" end="01:21:15.329" style="s2">sort of have a general size that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.469" end="01:21:16.739" style="s2">have and never get much bigger or much</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.329" end="01:21:20.419" style="s2">smaller than that think of a human</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.739" end="01:21:23.459" style="s2">beings height or weight you know you you</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.419" end="01:21:24.749" style="s2">might see someone who&#39;s 500 pounds maybe</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.459" end="01:21:27.119" style="s2">a little more but you&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.749" end="01:21:28.499" style="s2">see someone who&#39;s a thousand pounds so</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.119" end="01:21:32.010" style="s2">you have a characteristic scale of human</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.499" end="01:21:33.599" style="s2">beings exist around 150 pounds whereas</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.010" end="01:21:35.249" style="s2">an avalanche</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.599" end="01:21:37.739" style="s2">there&#39;s no characteristic scale of an</p>

<p begin="01:21:40.439" end="01:21:44.879" style="s2">magnitude bigger than those small ones</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.469" end="01:21:46.590" style="s2">so this is this is known as a power law</p>

<p begin="01:21:46.590" end="01:21:51.329" style="s2">distribution and the self-organized part</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.289" end="01:21:52.889" style="s2">of that is the fact that when you&#39;re you</p>

<p begin="01:21:52.889" end="01:21:55.459" style="s2">you&#39;re dropping those grains of sand</p>

<p begin="01:21:55.459" end="01:22:01.530" style="s2">there&#39;s no controller who&#39;s deciding how</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.729" end="01:22:03.419" style="s2">those pieces are organized to cause this</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.530" end="01:22:06.149" style="s2">to happen it&#39;s just by virtue of the way</p>

<p begin="01:22:06.149" end="01:22:12.659" style="s2">know a 1 you&#39;ll hear about our forest</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.149" end="01:22:15.199" style="s2">fires when a fire happens it burns out</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.659" end="01:22:18.239" style="s2">the the fuel the dead wood that&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.199" end="01:22:19.469" style="s2">if you have more and more debt would</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.239" end="01:22:22.379" style="s2">build up so it&#39;s a long time between</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.469" end="01:22:25.079" style="s2">fires and your fires bigger so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.379" end="01:22:27.179" style="s2">no one organizing that explicitly say in</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.079" end="01:22:28.979" style="s2">an uncontrolled environment but it just</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.179" end="01:22:31.919" style="s2">happens that way that a lot of times a</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.979" end="01:22:33.599" style="s2">little spark or a spark the lightning</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.919" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">bolt hit something there&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.599" end="01:22:37.439" style="s2">of dead wood around and burns up and</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.070" end="01:22:39.119" style="s2">it&#39;s done maybe there&#39;s a long long time</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.439" end="01:22:40.679" style="s2">between that happens and the dead wood</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.119" end="01:22:42.090" style="s2">is still built up that your fire is a</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.679" end="01:22:44.190" style="s2">massive forest fire you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.090" end="01:22:49.620" style="s2">encompassing whole</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.190" end="01:22:52.170" style="s2">coast or something so the self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.620" end="01:22:56.970" style="s2">criticality is the fact that without any</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.170" end="01:22:59.100" style="s2">design you&#39;re getting these kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.970" end="01:23:02.100" style="s2">dynamics that are sending out every once</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.100" end="01:23:04.200" style="s2">in a while these events so massive that</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.100" end="01:23:07.470" style="s2">they just door if anything you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.200" end="01:23:08.880" style="s2">before they&#39;re just bigger than anything</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.470" end="01:23:11.220" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen before and and not only that</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.880" end="01:23:12.570" style="s2">but you&#39;ll continue to get bigger ones</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.220" end="01:23:13.620" style="s2">in the future that you&#39;ve seen before so</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.570" end="01:23:15.270" style="s2">even when you think you&#39;ve seen the most</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.620" end="01:23:16.620" style="s2">massive thing no there&#39;s there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.270" end="01:23:21.780" style="s2">massive things to come that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.620" end="01:23:24.570" style="s2">shown themselves yet so so you know this</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.780" end="01:23:27.600" style="s2">is a this is a law of you know of some</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.570" end="01:23:30.210" style="s2">kind is you know is this something you</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:32.310" style="s2">can bank on its in are there counter</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.210" end="01:23:35.190" style="s2">points to like when you clear the forest</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.310" end="01:23:36.870" style="s2">brush do you end up with bigger smaller</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.190" end="01:23:38.640" style="s2">fires in the end or bigger fires in the</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.870" end="01:23:40.830" style="s2">event a well if you clear it you&#39;ll end</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.640" end="01:23:42.510" style="s2">up with smaller fires if you stop the</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.830" end="01:23:43.890" style="s2">fire and don&#39;t let it burn out and keep</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.510" end="01:23:46.080" style="s2">it there you hit finger fires</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.890" end="01:23:49.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s I would think of it so much as a</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.080" end="01:23:53.190" style="s2">law as a universality class which is</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.320" end="01:23:55.320" style="s2">just a big way of saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.190" end="01:23:59.160" style="s2">many kinds of systems that can embody</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.320" end="01:24:01.070" style="s2">this specific pattern so have you seen</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.160" end="01:24:04.140" style="s2">have you seen that in social systems</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.070" end="01:24:07.050" style="s2">well I mean certainly seen in financial</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.140" end="01:24:12.270" style="s2">systems right so get these small little</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.050" end="01:24:14.460" style="s2">dips and then huge huge crashes so and</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.270" end="01:24:16.740" style="s2">and and yeah you course see it in social</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.460" end="01:24:18.540" style="s2">systems otherwise and there could be</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.740" end="01:24:22.680" style="s2">some things akin to the forest fire in</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.540" end="01:24:26.160" style="s2">that as we attempt to quell our passions</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.680" end="01:24:29.610" style="s2">to not fight to not Duke it out you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.160" end="01:24:32.820" style="s2">that stuff gets bottled up and how does</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.610" end="01:24:36.630" style="s2">it come out I don&#39;t know so eventually</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.820" end="01:24:38.730" style="s2">in in in warfare physical violence and</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.630" end="01:24:41.370" style="s2">all that so there there is something to</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.730" end="01:24:43.890" style="s2">be said for you know kind of a Steven</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.370" end="01:24:44.790" style="s2">Pinker kind of stuff that you</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.890" end="01:24:46.320" style="s2">know everything&#39;s getting better all the</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.790" end="01:24:50.790" style="s2">time and don&#39;t worry about it look</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.320" end="01:24:54.360" style="s2">here&#39;s the data the GDP and flip dude</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.790" end="01:24:56.820" style="s2">you know oh all that stuff he bases on</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.360" end="01:24:57.690" style="s2">like well there&#39;s fewer fistfights you</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.820" end="01:24:59.070" style="s2">know in the bar</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.690" end="01:25:03.239" style="s2">and so it&#39;s clear things are getting</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.070" end="01:25:05.100" style="s2">better but local infighting can actually</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.239" end="01:25:09.270" style="s2">be something that releases the pressure</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.100" end="01:25:11.010" style="s2">so to speak and you know people talk</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.270" end="01:25:12.180" style="s2">about in history oh they used to be</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.010" end="01:25:14.430" style="s2">everyone used to be at war all the time</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.180" end="01:25:17.000" style="s2">but if you actually look at what those</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.430" end="01:25:19.170" style="s2">wars looked like before the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.000" end="01:25:21.510" style="s2">they were actually pretty small scale</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.170" end="01:25:24.719" style="s2">most of the time yeah little skirmishes</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.510" end="01:25:27.210" style="s2">some people died no doubt terrible stuff</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.719" end="01:25:29.940" style="s2">but not the kind of stuff you know not</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.210" end="01:25:33.570" style="s2">world war two type stuff not these huge</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.940" end="01:25:37.230" style="s2">massive events that that&#39;s go on and on</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.570" end="01:25:39.150" style="s2">and seem to have no end so you do see</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.230" end="01:25:41.940" style="s2">and this is sort of where I was going</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.150" end="01:25:44.070" style="s2">with this is there are some people some</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.940" end="01:25:47.790" style="s2">some authors out there and writers that</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.070" end="01:25:50.040" style="s2">are speculating that the violence is one</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.790" end="01:25:52.140" style="s2">of these complex systems and that to the</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.040" end="01:25:54.690" style="s2">extent that we like stop the fire from</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.140" end="01:25:58.350" style="s2">burning we&#39;re just actually postponing a</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.690" end="01:26:00.690" style="s2">later power law event of violence that</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.350" end="01:26:03.630" style="s2">is just going to happen as a matter of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.690" end="01:26:05.250" style="s2">sort of mathematical certainty based on</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.630" end="01:26:06.930" style="s2">this principle of self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.250" end="01:26:10.230" style="s2">criticality well I think there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.930" end="01:26:12.810" style="s2">author saying that there&#39;s one author&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.230" end="01:26:14.340" style="s2">saying that and I was interested in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.810" end="01:26:16.020" style="s2">way that this applied here because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.340" end="01:26:18.150" style="s2">just fascinating to see where where</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.020" end="01:26:19.110" style="s2">cause and effect you know you think</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.150" end="01:26:21.000" style="s2">you&#39;re you think you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.110" end="01:26:23.010" style="s2">something out here but you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.000" end="01:26:25.469" style="s2">just back logging and waiting for</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.010" end="01:26:28.410" style="s2">something more more terrible to happen</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.469" end="01:26:31.830" style="s2">down the road and it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.410" end="01:26:34.680" style="s2">fascinating concept and you know the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.830" end="01:26:37.020" style="s2">you tie this into the masculinity issues</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.680" end="01:26:38.520" style="s2">and boys being boys and we don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.020" end="01:26:40.380" style="s2">them fistfight there&#39;s no more mutual</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.520" end="01:26:42.570" style="s2">combat hell we don&#39;t let our kids play</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.380" end="01:26:44.310" style="s2">football so much anymore and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.570" end="01:26:47.250" style="s2">teaching kids out of box and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.310" end="01:26:48.930" style="s2">just controlled way to either express</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.250" end="01:26:51.989" style="s2">your anger in a controlled environment</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.930" end="01:26:54.360" style="s2">that&#39;s non-lethal and whatever and to</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.989" end="01:26:57.540" style="s2">also sort of find your place in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.360" end="01:26:59.520" style="s2">hierarchy right like it&#39;s good to know</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.540" end="01:27:01.410" style="s2">where you stand in a hierarchy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.520" end="01:27:03.750" style="s2">oftentimes a dominant person in a group</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.410" end="01:27:05.760" style="s2">but I know when I&#39;m not right and then</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.750" end="01:27:07.600" style="s2">when I&#39;m in a room or in a circumstance</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.760" end="01:27:09.190" style="s2">where I need to be a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.600" end="01:27:10.660" style="s2">behind-the-scenes or step back a little</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.190" end="01:27:13.720" style="s2">bit I&#39;m happy to do that man-like</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.660" end="01:27:14.860" style="s2">hierarchy is good for us and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.720" end="01:27:17.350" style="s2">think that our current political</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.860" end="01:27:21.520" style="s2">environment appreciates hierarchy as a</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.350" end="01:27:23.680" style="s2">benefit to us in our organization and to</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.520" end="01:27:25.630" style="s2">our evolution well sort of you know I</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.680" end="01:27:28.090" style="s2">would actually I would actually say that</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.630" end="01:27:30.100" style="s2">maybe in terms of the rhetoric you might</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.090" end="01:27:32.860" style="s2">do right but it seems that people are</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.100" end="01:27:36.430" style="s2">constantly fired vying for sort of top</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.860" end="01:27:37.720" style="s2">of the control hierarchy right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.430" end="01:27:39.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s smoke and mirrors right</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.720" end="01:27:41.950" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.880" end="01:27:43.530" style="s2">somehow evolved beyond that but I think</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.950" end="01:27:47.470" style="s2">an important point what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.530" end="01:27:49.600" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of I get I get a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.470" end="01:27:51.910" style="s2">worried about hierarchical claims</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.600" end="01:27:53.920" style="s2">because so many things are that we</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.910" end="01:27:55.960" style="s2">assume or I or gold turn out not to be I</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.920" end="01:27:58.150" style="s2">think in what you&#39;re you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.960" end="01:28:00.730" style="s2">about are these dominance structures and</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.150" end="01:28:03.640" style="s2">whatnot one of the important points is</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.730" end="01:28:06.310" style="s2">that they&#39;re dynamic it&#39;s not some fixed</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.640" end="01:28:07.600" style="s2">thing so you walk into this room this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.310" end="01:28:09.310" style="s2">this is the kind of structure that</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.600" end="01:28:10.600" style="s2">emerges you walk into a room with</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.310" end="01:28:13.200" style="s2">different people and it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.600" end="01:28:15.400" style="s2">different and and your place there</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.200" end="01:28:16.960" style="s2">depends on who&#39;s in that room and the</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.400" end="01:28:19.480" style="s2">actions that unfold and all the</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.960" end="01:28:22.000" style="s2">interactions and all that so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.480" end="01:28:25.540" style="s2">very dynamic there are hierarchies but</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.000" end="01:28:28.390" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re fluid they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.540" end="01:28:30.250" style="s2">dynamic and they&#39;re they&#39;re subject to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.390" end="01:28:31.920" style="s2">the push and pull of a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.250" end="01:28:35.080" style="s2">forces that are non hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.920" end="01:28:36.670" style="s2">definitely and and as Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.080" end="01:28:38.470" style="s2">pointed out and was very careful to</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.670" end="01:28:40.210" style="s2">point out when he would use the phrase</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.470" end="01:28:42.220" style="s2">dominance hierarchies which I think he</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.210" end="01:28:44.110" style="s2">was beaten into submission to relenting</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.220" end="01:28:46.630" style="s2">to changing that into competency</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.110" end="01:28:48.040" style="s2">hierarchies but what&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.630" end="01:28:49.450" style="s2">remember about a dominance hierarchy is</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.040" end="01:28:51.490" style="s2">that it has to be beneficial for</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.450" end="01:28:53.680" style="s2">everyone in the hierarchy for it to for</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.490" end="01:28:57.040" style="s2">it to maintain alright like the long</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.680" end="01:28:59.260" style="s2">term health of that hierarchy depends on</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.040" end="01:29:01.270" style="s2">people up and down on all around you</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.260" end="01:29:03.850" style="s2">collectively benefiting from it it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.270" end="01:29:06.460" style="s2">like dominance has such a negative</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.850" end="01:29:09.040" style="s2">connotation to it it sounds domineering</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.460" end="01:29:10.780" style="s2">or I&#39;m authoritarian or something but no</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.040" end="01:29:12.520" style="s2">I mean it&#39;s his leadership and</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.780" end="01:29:14.830" style="s2">capability and power and but if you</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.520" end="01:29:16.570" style="s2">don&#39;t take care of the people in the</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.830" end="01:29:19.720" style="s2">hierarchy then the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.570" end="01:29:21.310" style="s2">have no reason to exist and I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.720" end="01:29:22.660" style="s2">people get confused when they hear the</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.310" end="01:29:23.770" style="s2">phrase dominance hierarchy and think</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.660" end="01:29:25.480" style="s2">that it&#39;s some terrible and nefarious</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.770" end="01:29:26.890" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s actually I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.480" end="01:29:29.380" style="s2">something that we fall into very</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.890" end="01:29:31.900" style="s2">naturally use a look at each other&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.380" end="01:29:33.820" style="s2">know physical sizes power outputs</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.900" end="01:29:35.980" style="s2">intellectual outputs powers I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.820" end="01:29:37.810" style="s2">know where I fit in the hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.980" end="01:29:39.970" style="s2">I&#39;m ok with it because I just want to do</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.810" end="01:29:41.470" style="s2">the thing that I can do the best and</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.970" end="01:29:43.030" style="s2">again if you don&#39;t have a 360</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.470" end="01:29:44.470" style="s2">perspective and make sure that the</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.030" end="01:29:46.480" style="s2">hierarchy works for everyone involved</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.470" end="01:29:49.090" style="s2">then it just doesn&#39;t have any any</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.480" end="01:29:51.970" style="s2">longevity as far as I can tell I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.090" end="01:29:53.440" style="s2">like the idea of not necessarily like</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.970" end="01:29:55.210" style="s2">not necessarily this hierarchy but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.440" end="01:29:56.620" style="s2">calling it dominance hierarchy because</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.210" end="01:29:58.750" style="s2">then you have some kind of a slice of</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.620" end="01:30:00.400" style="s2">reality that maybe maybe makes sense to</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.750" end="01:30:01.870" style="s2">think of that way you know that guy can</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.400" end="01:30:04.360" style="s2">beat the out of that guy then you</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.870" end="01:30:06.550" style="s2">know no question there you go that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.360" end="01:30:08.440" style="s2">order yeah yeah but there&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.550" end="01:30:12.310" style="s2">said there&#39;s like this intelligence as a</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.440" end="01:30:14.710" style="s2">whole there&#39;s infinite dimensions you</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.310" end="01:30:16.600" style="s2">could slice the situation on and and</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.710" end="01:30:17.740" style="s2">what is the what is the context and</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.600" end="01:30:18.910" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna affect everything that</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.740" end="01:30:20.830" style="s2">that&#39;s further reason I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.910" end="01:30:22.690" style="s2">hesitant about committing too much to</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.830" end="01:30:24.550" style="s2">hierarchies because it&#39;s it seems</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.690" end="01:30:26.910" style="s2">there&#39;s too much going on to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.550" end="01:30:29.770" style="s2">reduce it to such a simple structure</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.910" end="01:30:31.420" style="s2">yeah yeah but you know I think about it</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.770" end="01:30:33.430" style="s2">in terms of evolution right you get</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.420" end="01:30:36.970" style="s2">variety and then selection and what what</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.430" end="01:30:38.200" style="s2">is what is a proper evolution approving</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.970" end="01:30:40.420" style="s2">you know that something is actually</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.200" end="01:30:42.130" style="s2">adaptive and functional it has to</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.420" end="01:30:45.070" style="s2">somehow stand out right it has to</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.130" end="01:30:46.960" style="s2">somehow appear to be superior right so</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.070" end="01:30:49.600" style="s2">should we should be we should be</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.960" end="01:30:51.730" style="s2">creating systems in which the superior</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.600" end="01:30:52.960" style="s2">tends has an ability to surface right</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.730" end="01:30:54.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t that something that we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.960" end="01:30:57.250" style="s2">talking about through all this is like</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.580" end="01:30:59.470" style="s2">making sure that we still have enough</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.250" end="01:31:01.570" style="s2">variety that then is allowed to flourish</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.470" end="01:31:03.490" style="s2">so that we can see which one wins and</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.570" end="01:31:05.380" style="s2">which one loses there has to be winners</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.490" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">and losers right there certainly has to</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.380" end="01:31:08.680" style="s2">be winners and losers but there doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.120" end="01:31:11.070" style="s2">have to be sort of back to your point</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.680" end="01:31:13.510" style="s2">about Helvetica there&#39;s not sort of one</p>
<p begin="01:31:11.070" end="01:31:16.360" style="s2">static winner for all time and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.510" end="01:31:18.340" style="s2">done right that&#39;s exactly right exactly</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.360" end="01:31:20.380" style="s2">right and it&#39;s about for my perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.340" end="01:31:22.990" style="s2">with liminal order about designing for</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.380" end="01:31:25.480" style="s2">emergence trying to create a system that</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.990" end="01:31:26.890" style="s2">will surface the most important salient</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.480" end="01:31:29.179" style="s2">topics the things that are most relevant</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.890" end="01:31:32.600" style="s2">to us allowing us to focus</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.179" end="01:31:35.840" style="s2">our signal in on that so that we are</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.600" end="01:31:37.489" style="s2">adaptive I&#39;ve designed the liminal order</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.840" end="01:31:38.870" style="s2">with all these things in mind for</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.489" end="01:31:40.070" style="s2">generation warfare which we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.870" end="01:31:42.949" style="s2">talked about but all this</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.070" end="01:31:46.460" style="s2">decentralization localism even within</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.949" end="01:31:48.469" style="s2">the group we have the sort of HQ level</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.460" end="01:31:50.179" style="s2">workshops and seminars and theme setting</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.469" end="01:31:52.610" style="s2">but then we strongly encourage you guys</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.179" end="01:31:54.590" style="s2">to find their ways into squads of like</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.610" end="01:31:56.330" style="s2">four to eight guys so that they can make</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.590" end="01:31:59.000" style="s2">personal connections we encourage them</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.330" end="01:32:02.120" style="s2">to do that both geographically and by</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.000" end="01:32:03.920" style="s2">interest and so even within the group</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.120" end="01:32:05.270" style="s2">that I&#39;ve built that has some structure</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.920" end="01:32:07.370" style="s2">we&#39;re also trying to build the</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.270" end="01:32:09.320" style="s2">decentralized nature of it where people</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.370" end="01:32:11.390" style="s2">can coalesce around whatever it is that</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.320" end="01:32:14.179" style="s2">they need to call us around but all with</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.390" end="01:32:17.120" style="s2">the fundamental values as the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.179" end="01:32:20.120" style="s2">brought us together in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.120" end="01:32:24.140" style="s2">I saw a tweet from Balaji the other day</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.120" end="01:32:25.969" style="s2">that tech guy and he said that he came</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.140" end="01:32:27.020" style="s2">up with a way to create a new town he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.969" end="01:32:29.780" style="s2">like here&#39;s how you create a new town</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.020" end="01:32:31.070" style="s2">first forget about the land the land is</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.780" end="01:32:32.120" style="s2">the absolute last thing that you need</p>
<p begin="01:32:31.070" end="01:32:35.210" style="s2">the first thing you need to do is</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.120" end="01:32:37.820" style="s2">establish a set of values get the</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.210" end="01:32:40.580" style="s2">customs and the norms established get</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.820" end="01:32:42.530" style="s2">the community established and then you</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.580" end="01:32:44.840" style="s2">can begin to speculate as to what kind</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.530" end="01:32:47.480" style="s2">of geography you need you build a city</p>
<p begin="01:32:44.840" end="01:32:49.370" style="s2">virtually you test it all out in VR</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.480" end="01:32:50.840" style="s2">everyone&#39;s like this works for me then</p>
<p begin="01:32:49.370" end="01:32:52.699" style="s2">you find the land then you build it and</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.840" end="01:32:54.230" style="s2">then everybody moves in you already have</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.699" end="01:32:56.090" style="s2">the values you already have the customs</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.230" end="01:32:58.340" style="s2">you already have the norms and the</p>
<p begin="01:32:56.090" end="01:33:01.130" style="s2">geography is sort of the last bit which</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.340" end="01:33:03.440" style="s2">totally turns on its head everything</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.130" end="01:33:05.480" style="s2">that we&#39;ve experienced this humans up</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.440" end="01:33:07.750" style="s2">until this point is that right and do</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.480" end="01:33:09.920" style="s2">you see any value in that in the future</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.750" end="01:33:13.400" style="s2">it&#39;s an interesting idea I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.920" end="01:33:15.770" style="s2">that it&#39;s right ok tell me I I think</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.400" end="01:33:17.449" style="s2">diggable house I think I think so for</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.770" end="01:33:19.159" style="s2">things like cultural practices to emerge</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.449" end="01:33:23.679" style="s2">this is another process of evolution</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.159" end="01:33:26.150" style="s2">that a culture forms the the kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.679" end="01:33:30.170" style="s2">ways that we exchange information</p>

<p begin="01:33:30.170" end="01:33:33.890" style="s2">exactly the same way at all it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.239" end="01:33:35.900" style="s2">different kind of interaction you might</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.890" end="01:33:38.360" style="s2">get along with someone so well he&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.900" end="01:33:40.400" style="s2">best bud online and then he you know</p>

<p begin="01:33:43.010" end="01:33:47.000" style="s2">and I think that you know it&#39;s back to</p>

<p begin="01:33:47.000" end="01:33:50.420" style="s2">things that they missed is like how are</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.889" end="01:33:51.500" style="s2">they gonna feed themselves you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:50.420" end="01:33:55.369" style="s2">you&#39;re autonomous how are you gonna feed</p>
<p begin="01:33:51.500" end="01:33:58.000" style="s2">yourself so I think we need you know</p>

<p begin="01:33:58.000" end="01:34:04.639" style="s2">but I think that tech mindset can cause</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.809" end="01:34:05.900" style="s2">you to kind of forget about some of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.639" end="01:34:09.099" style="s2">things that actually ground us in the</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.900" end="01:34:11.750" style="s2">world and actually sustain us and I</p>

<p begin="01:34:11.750" end="01:34:15.710" style="s2">sort of merits to discuss that because I</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.730" end="01:34:18.559" style="s2">think there is and is what we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.710" end="01:34:20.900" style="s2">discussing earlier you know maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.559" end="01:34:22.610" style="s2">solution in part is to move and then</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.900" end="01:34:23.989" style="s2">stop moving kind of find your zone and</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.610" end="01:34:26.030" style="s2">stop moving and stay in place for a</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.989" end="01:34:28.250" style="s2">while so that&#39;s kind of that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.030" end="01:34:29.599" style="s2">feel you know but I when I was think</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.250" end="01:34:30.949" style="s2">about I was think more of finding a</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.599" end="01:34:32.539" style="s2">place that kind of already exists this</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.949" end="01:34:36.469" style="s2">is already town I&#39;m moving into the town</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.539" end="01:34:38.900" style="s2">trying to form all of that structure</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.469" end="01:34:43.130" style="s2">without the actual physical interaction</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.900" end="01:34:45.230" style="s2">of people to me I don&#39;t think so I you</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.130" end="01:34:48.769" style="s2">know one of the things that that is so</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.230" end="01:34:51.559" style="s2">whom has been so useful for me is to</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.769" end="01:34:54.429" style="s2">actually you know grow a garden have</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.559" end="01:34:54.429" style="s2">some livestock</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.480" end="01:34:59.489" style="s2">I can&#39;t imagine kind of even thinking</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.870" end="01:35:02.010" style="s2">about autonomy without thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.489" end="01:35:03.300" style="s2">agriculture first that&#39;s just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.010" end="01:35:06.960" style="s2">the way I&#39;m wired this is how I think</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.300" end="01:35:09.780" style="s2">about it&#39;s how I see it you know open</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.960" end="01:35:11.550" style="s2">systems right so so how are how are</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.780" end="01:35:13.670" style="s2">people open systems how our organisms</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.550" end="01:35:17.000" style="s2">open systems we eat food we drink water</p>

<p begin="01:35:18.030" end="01:35:21.960" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to forget about those</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.039" end="01:35:23.760" style="s2">things when when you kind of take them</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.960" end="01:35:25.800" style="s2">for granted but I think moving into the</p>
<p begin="01:35:23.760" end="01:35:27.270" style="s2">future we&#39;ll be able to take them less</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.800" end="01:35:28.520" style="s2">and less for granted I mean you look at</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.270" end="01:35:31.559" style="s2">this rotavirus thing in those uh</p>

<p begin="01:36:25.079" end="01:36:28.710" style="s2">in my life you know the the times at</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.389" end="01:36:30.809" style="s2">which I felt the most pain were the</p>

<p begin="01:36:30.809" end="01:36:35.610" style="s2">act right so eventually we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:36:33.599" end="01:36:38.070" style="s2">just have a dissonance of feeling inside</p>
<p begin="01:36:35.610" end="01:36:39.539" style="s2">of us that just gets so great all these</p>

<p begin="01:36:44.730" end="01:36:48.750" style="s2">action before the pain comes but the</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.920" end="01:36:51.480" style="s2">pain does seem to be a really big</p>
<p begin="01:36:48.750" end="01:36:53.489" style="s2">motivator big motivator for most people</p>

<p begin="01:36:55.980" end="01:37:01.139" style="s2">this has been a fantastic discussion for</p>
<p begin="01:36:59.070" end="01:37:05.760" style="s2">me I loved seeing the way all these</p>

<p begin="01:37:05.760" end="01:37:10.920" style="s2">echo have a have a similar scent have a</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.949" end="01:37:13.829" style="s2">similar vibe with the systems and the</p>

<p begin="01:37:22.230" end="01:37:27.869" style="s2">wise national security wise and I think</p>
<p begin="01:37:26.190" end="01:37:29.710" style="s2">that the study of these systems is</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.869" end="01:37:32.650" style="s2">obviously more important</p>
<p begin="01:37:29.710" end="01:37:35.100" style="s2">than ever and hopefully these ideas will</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.650" end="01:37:37.600" style="s2">begin to percolate out into the wider</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.100" end="01:37:39.700" style="s2">conversations I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.600" end="01:37:43.030" style="s2">heady stuff there&#39;s no question about</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.700" end="01:37:45.280" style="s2">that but it is it is a way to see the</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.030" end="01:37:49.810" style="s2">world and it is a model that has a</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.280" end="01:37:55.960" style="s2">unifying factors from the universe down</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.810" end="01:37:58.840" style="s2">to you and your chickens and manukan</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.960" end="01:38:02.050" style="s2">tune yourselves to the to the vibe of</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.840" end="01:38:04.600" style="s2">the of the universe right like work is</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.050" end="01:38:06.130" style="s2">good action is good right and an</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.600" end="01:38:08.080" style="s2">evolution is good if you can tune</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.130" end="01:38:11.620" style="s2">yourself to those vibes you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.080" end="01:38:13.120" style="s2">find yourself in a better place one</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.620" end="01:38:15.460" style="s2">thing that you said that struck me also</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.120" end="01:38:18.580" style="s2">is we need to also be aware of the time</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.460" end="01:38:22.330" style="s2">scale of this stuff so you said that</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.580" end="01:38:24.910" style="s2">your agricultural iterations are annual</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.330" end="01:38:27.280" style="s2">and man that must be tough for somebody</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.910" end="01:38:29.080" style="s2">you&#39;re a programmer you said or you work</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.280" end="01:38:31.090" style="s2">with data you know so you&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.080" end="01:38:32.620" style="s2">getting pretty quick results you grate</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.090" end="01:38:35.320" style="s2">some code you get a result you see what</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.620" end="01:38:37.870" style="s2">happens but man if you gotta take a year</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.320" end="01:38:40.690" style="s2">to see if that one plan worked out that</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.870" end="01:38:42.910" style="s2">that requires a whole different vibe</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.690" end="01:38:46.150" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it it absolutely does but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.910" end="01:38:48.969" style="s2">tell you the thing I felt most from that</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.150" end="01:38:51.489" style="s2">is actually relief so yeah things things</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.969" end="01:38:52.810" style="s2">go fast in the digital realm and things</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.489" end="01:38:57.460" style="s2">go a lot slower in the physical realm</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.810" end="01:38:59.710" style="s2">and there&#39;s a kind of rhythm slow</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.460" end="01:39:02.680" style="s2">frequency rhythm that I&#39;ve started to</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.710" end="01:39:03.820" style="s2">tune in to I&#39;d almost say tune back into</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.680" end="01:39:10.480" style="s2">but I can&#39;t really say that I ever was</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.820" end="01:39:11.920" style="s2">tuned into it personally and that is for</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.480" end="01:39:13.960" style="s2">me one of the important parts about</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.920" end="01:39:17.350" style="s2">about kind of cultivating a place-based</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.960" end="01:39:20.050" style="s2">life is that there&#39;s these rhythms that</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.350" end="01:39:23.140" style="s2">were embedded in and and play a role in</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.050" end="01:39:25.390" style="s2">and this high frequency buzzing of</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.140" end="01:39:26.920" style="s2">modernity has drown it all out and you</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.390" end="01:39:28.000" style="s2">don&#39;t even feel those feelings anymore</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.920" end="01:39:31.330" style="s2">you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re not feeling</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.000" end="01:39:33.330" style="s2">them all right but you know I don&#39;t know</p>
