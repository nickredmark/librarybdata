<p begin="00:02:13.400" end="00:02:16.670" style="s2">they are all that the thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.750" end="00:02:18.830" style="s2">interesting is they are not intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.670" end="00:02:21.260" style="s2">in the slightest least the enlisted men</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.830" end="00:02:22.550" style="s2">that I&#39;ve met hmm well you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.260" end="00:02:24.080" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because I think I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.550" end="00:02:25.550" style="s2">mean a obviously massive mass</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.030" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">operations domain the more humble the</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:40.360" style="s2">more lateral and divergent in their</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.450" end="00:02:43.070" style="s2">thinking I mean I experienced some very</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.360" end="00:02:45.170" style="s2">discipline but voracious learners at</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.070" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">that level of the organization&#39;s yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.170" end="00:02:48.140" style="s2">course the higher level the officer</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:49.670" style="s2">corps I would expect to see that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.140" end="00:02:51.020" style="s2">makes it I&#39;m continually blown away by</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.670" end="00:02:52.610" style="s2">the thoughtfulness actually the depth</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.020" end="00:02:54.440" style="s2">and the thoughtfulness of leadership at</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.610" end="00:02:55.670" style="s2">that of those commands that&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.440" end="00:02:57.260" style="s2">hear actually because they are the short</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.670" end="00:02:59.870" style="s2">point of the spear protecting us all</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.260" end="00:03:02.060" style="s2">right yeah at the whim of an executive</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.870" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2">department you know then it&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.060" end="00:03:07.490" style="s2">McCarrick all at best right yeah a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.540" end="00:03:10.610" style="s2">of your work deals with individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.490" end="00:03:12.800" style="s2">groups achieving the state of flow flow</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.610" end="00:03:14.900" style="s2">was first defined by a guy Kenny would</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.800" end="00:03:20.690" style="s2">pronounce his name mahalia clicks I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.900" end="00:03:22.130" style="s2">Mick Lee Mihaly or some damn thing why</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.690" end="00:03:25.250" style="s2">don&#39;t you start by telling us what is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.130" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">flow hmm well I mean it&#39;s just a subset</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.250" end="00:03:30.320" style="s2">of a whole broad category of what you</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:31.670" style="s2">could call non-ordinary States we might</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.320" end="00:03:34.489" style="s2">as well even call these specific ones</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.670" end="00:03:36.140" style="s2">benign non-ordinary States so so not</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.489" end="00:03:38.030" style="s2">schizophrenia and not dissociation not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.140" end="00:03:42.430" style="s2">something like that but actually ones of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.030" end="00:03:46.340" style="s2">peaks peak information a perception and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.430" end="00:03:49.130" style="s2">and hyper efficient action from there so</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.340" end="00:03:50.600" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of neuro chemical profile it</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.130" end="00:03:52.430" style="s2">has a neuro physiological profile it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.600" end="00:03:53.810" style="s2">also has a psychological experience or</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.430" end="00:03:56.840" style="s2">profile and then also kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.810" end="00:03:57.890" style="s2">operational range of application of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.840" end="00:04:00.500" style="s2">to do with it when you&#39;re in it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.890" end="00:04:02.810" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I&#39;ve fallen into flow</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.500" end="00:04:04.580" style="s2">States on several occasions in my life</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.810" end="00:04:08.300" style="s2">and they have been extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.580" end="00:04:10.670" style="s2">productive like you know 10x the normal</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.300" end="00:04:13.250" style="s2">horsepower quite remarkable straight up</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.670" end="00:04:14.600" style="s2">anyplace but at some point tiring I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.250" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">her I fell into one that lasted six</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.600" end="00:04:18.470" style="s2">weeks for no apparent reason I was</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:21.049" style="s2">writing a business plan and I just blew</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.470" end="00:04:23.060" style="s2">through at about two weeks and I had so</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.049" end="00:04:25.550" style="s2">much mental firepower that a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.060" end="00:04:28.310" style="s2">mine just started lining up like company</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.550" end="00:04:30.770" style="s2">CEOs you know chief technology officers</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.310" end="00:04:32.390" style="s2">and just had them marched by me and sit</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.770" end="00:04:33.950" style="s2">down for 10 minutes tell them tell me</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.390" end="00:04:35.710" style="s2">their problem and I&#39;d give them the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.950" end="00:04:38.650" style="s2">perfect answer every time it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.710" end="00:04:41.180" style="s2">remarkably uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.650" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">and did you like sleep for a month what</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.180" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">happened afterwards it&#39;s funny I can</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:47.060" style="s2">actually feel myself drop out of it over</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:50.330" style="s2">a period of about two hours first one</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.060" end="00:04:52.280" style="s2">step down from you know immaculate to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.330" end="00:04:54.140" style="s2">just really really really good and at</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.280" end="00:04:55.790" style="s2">another two hours later back to normal</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.140" end="00:04:58.190" style="s2">and I think I did sleep for a day but</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.790" end="00:05:00.200" style="s2">but it was pretty cool I know I&#39;d also</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.190" end="00:05:02.030" style="s2">know to our people that on the website</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.200" end="00:05:03.950" style="s2">for your flow Genome Project there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.030" end="00:05:05.780" style="s2">thing called the flow profile we&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.950" end="00:05:07.640" style="s2">a link up on our site people go take a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.780" end="00:05:09.490" style="s2">look at it take a test and I took the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.640" end="00:05:13.430" style="s2">test oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.490" end="00:05:15.320" style="s2">it has a hard charger oh sweet which was</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.430" end="00:05:16.910" style="s2">mostly right but it was wrong about me</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.320" end="00:05:17.480" style="s2">being interested in physically active</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.910" end="00:05:19.820" style="s2">sports</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.480" end="00:05:22.010" style="s2">I&#39;m way too physically lazy for those</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.820" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">but I do like that do crazy and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.010" end="00:05:26.810" style="s2">take risks like legally manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:29.570" style="s2">homemade explosives shooting large</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.810" end="00:05:32.150" style="s2">high-capacity guns high-stakes poker or</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.570" end="00:05:33.980" style="s2">doing ridiculous things on a TVs that</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.150" end="00:05:35.660" style="s2">might not be all that wise so as long as</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.980" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">they don&#39;t require breaking a sweat I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.660" end="00:05:40.460" style="s2">all in do it that&#39;s fantastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:43.250" style="s2">yeah all the risk none of the calorie</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.460" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">burn it&#39;s perfect exactly exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.250" end="00:05:48.500" style="s2">so yeah I guess I fit a sort of a hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:50.600" style="s2">charger non sweat variety but yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.500" end="00:05:52.220" style="s2">kind of fun I advise people take it you</p>

<p begin="00:08:08.120" end="00:08:13.070" style="s2">to win or to explore you know I see flow</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.449" end="00:08:16.789" style="s2">as a possible way to those intrinsic</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.070" end="00:08:18.650" style="s2">States but not necessarily required hmm</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.789" end="00:08:21.560" style="s2">yeah I mean I think it you could make a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.650" end="00:08:23.990" style="s2">case that it&#39;s really just the you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.560" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">super economic version of that general</p>

<p begin="00:08:29.930" end="00:08:33.229" style="s2">way to do it better right or at least</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.610" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">certain slide yeah I mean if you get</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.229" end="00:08:36.169" style="s2">that sucker going right it&#39;ll it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:37.760" style="s2">speed you to your destination in the</p>

<p begin="00:08:37.760" end="00:08:41.020" style="s2">of time yeah but on the other hand I</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.409" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">would also like to say to warn people</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.020" end="00:08:47.660" style="s2">that it could become a hope for panacea</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.060" style="s2">well you know as I said I&#39;ve fallen into</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.660" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">flow state several times at and often at</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.060" end="00:08:56.240" style="s2">exactly the right time but sometimes not</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:59.000" style="s2">for instance in 2011 after eight years</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.240" end="00:09:01.339" style="s2">of research I sat down to write a long</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.000" end="00:09:03.680" style="s2">document that was the digest of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.339" end="00:09:04.800" style="s2">research and in fact this document</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.680" end="00:09:07.589" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.800" end="00:09:09.810" style="s2">the game be named name if game B</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.589" end="00:09:11.040" style="s2">succeeds this document was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.810" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">most important thing I ever wrote</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.040" end="00:09:16.019" style="s2">oh let&#39;s jump over to game B stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">future culture architecture and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.019" end="00:09:19.350" style="s2">what are the perils of non-ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:22.950" style="s2">States as they get operationalized</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.350" end="00:09:23.850" style="s2">commodified and weaponized and we&#39;ll hop</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.950" end="00:09:27.570" style="s2">there how&#39;s that sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.850" end="00:09:29.459" style="s2">so dude this is important which is I</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.570" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">started three times to write this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.459" end="00:09:33.779" style="s2">document and you know hacked at it for</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:36.690" style="s2">two or three days and the flow state</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.779" end="00:09:39.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t come and so I just said it</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.690" end="00:09:40.490" style="s2">and you know let it go for another</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.300" end="00:09:42.810" style="s2">couple of months did some more research</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.490" end="00:09:44.399" style="s2">finally the third time it was appear</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.810" end="00:09:47.250" style="s2">after six months of wanting to write</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.399" end="00:09:49.620" style="s2">this thing I just said to myself flow or</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.250" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">not I&#39;m just gonna you know hack back</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.620" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">through this thing I just muscled it</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:56.070" style="s2">right and it was good enough though it</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:57.990" style="s2">was hard to work and it took longer than</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.070" end="00:10:01.110" style="s2">if I&#39;ve been in a flow state so I would</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.990" end="00:10:02.760" style="s2">yeah I was put out the warning yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.110" end="00:10:04.829" style="s2">great when you do get the flow state to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.760" end="00:10:06.209" style="s2">boost your power but if you don&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.829" end="00:10:09.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t still do good</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.209" end="00:10:11.550" style="s2">work yeah the one the one I had to die I</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.120" end="00:10:13.470" style="s2">agree completely cuz I had to override</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.550" end="00:10:14.880" style="s2">that in my brain too of like waiting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.470" end="00:10:16.440" style="s2">craft the perfect verse and then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.880" end="00:10:18.440" style="s2">started thinking myself much more like a</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.440" end="00:10:21.000" style="s2">carpenter and there&#39;s like rough framing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.440" end="00:10:22.740" style="s2">and then there&#39;s finish framing and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.000" end="00:10:24.329" style="s2">fine detailing and like a know which</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.740" end="00:10:25.890" style="s2">fate and then there&#39;s caulking paint you</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.329" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">will they know which phase you&#39;re at and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.890" end="00:10:30.570" style="s2">and and sometimes just if you&#39;re not if</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.190" style="s2">you are having to just grind it out to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.570" end="00:10:32.910" style="s2">just be like I am just rough planking</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.190" end="00:10:35.070" style="s2">some right now</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.910" end="00:10:37.140" style="s2">yeah it&#39;ll all ink later yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.070" end="00:10:39.000" style="s2">and you know and it may take three times</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.140" end="00:10:40.829" style="s2">as long but you&#39;ll just get it done and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.000" end="00:10:43.260" style="s2">you know of course it would be great if</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.829" end="00:10:45.329" style="s2">we had flow state more or less on demand</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.260" end="00:10:48.480" style="s2">and your views that&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.329" end="00:10:51.300" style="s2">possible um I mean that&#39;s I mean sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.480" end="00:10:54.570" style="s2">yes end right I mean can you you know as</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.300" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">we get more skillful at all of these you</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.570" end="00:11:00.209" style="s2">know neuro physicians right so we really</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">are just kind of like truly dialing or</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.209" end="00:11:03.360" style="s2">programming states of awareness for</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:04.769" style="s2">different conditions and they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.360" end="00:11:06.240" style="s2">doing that and one offs and experiments</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.769" end="00:11:08.130" style="s2">and specific technical conditions but</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.240" end="00:11:10.649" style="s2">let&#39;s just say for all of us then like</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.130" end="00:11:13.079" style="s2">we still have the human existential</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.649" end="00:11:15.779" style="s2">questions and we still have both grace</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.079" end="00:11:17.640" style="s2">and grief and life so like that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.779" end="00:11:18.270" style="s2">table stakes and you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.640" end="00:11:20.550" style="s2">metabolize</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.270" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">those things regardless of what type a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.550" end="00:11:23.790" style="s2">button you you got installed yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">doubt about that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.790" end="00:11:28.710" style="s2">China to that point early on it&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:30.030" style="s2">switch now to your book stealing fire</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.710" end="00:11:32.310" style="s2">which I read a long time ago you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.030" end="00:11:34.680" style="s2">actually gave me a copy of it sound nice</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.310" end="00:11:37.650" style="s2">and I read it when we had coffee in</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.680" end="00:11:40.500" style="s2">Austin a few years ago and I reread it</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.650" end="00:11:42.780" style="s2">over the last week or so as I typically</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.500" end="00:11:44.820" style="s2">do thank you thank you for my episodes</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.780" end="00:11:46.530" style="s2">that I can speak cogently about people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.820" end="00:11:48.540" style="s2">work right not just my way</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.530" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">through one of things I loved about your</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.540" end="00:11:53.580" style="s2">book on like on page two you talked</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:55.710" style="s2">about the Eleusinian mysteries right</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.580" end="00:11:57.150" style="s2">yeah Lucy and mysteries I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.710" end="00:11:58.920" style="s2">the hell you spell this pronounce that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.150" end="00:11:59.880" style="s2">but something like that anyway I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">there&#39;s something I did a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.880" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">research on 20 years ago and 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.220" style="s2">ago there wasn&#39;t much tell us what you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">know about them and how they were so</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.220" end="00:12:09.450" style="s2">central in you know grounding</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:12.840" style="s2">essentially the meaning of life for</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.450" end="00:12:15.060" style="s2">people back in the day yeah I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.840" end="00:12:16.650" style="s2">was a sort of like a 9-day ritual people</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.060" end="00:12:18.750" style="s2">from all different costs of society</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.650" end="00:12:21.450" style="s2">could could participate it involved sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.750" end="00:12:23.220" style="s2">of theater pantomime archetypal roles</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.450" end="00:12:24.960" style="s2">potentially even and this was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.220" end="00:12:26.970" style="s2">like never disclosed super secret super</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.960" end="00:12:28.200" style="s2">secret you know some kind of I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.970" end="00:12:30.210" style="s2">know whether it was like a coffin like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.200" end="00:12:32.550" style="s2">death rebirth but some form of fairly</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.210" end="00:12:34.110" style="s2">profound initiatory shazam experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.550" end="00:12:36.390" style="s2">kind of like Michael Douglas in the game</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.110" end="00:12:39.570" style="s2">you know like something of that level of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.390" end="00:12:42.570" style="s2">juju and then ha you know highly likely</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.570" end="00:12:45.090" style="s2">to been involving the intoxicating</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.570" end="00:12:46.320" style="s2">sacrament of Chi Kyung you know with</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.090" end="00:12:48.570" style="s2">with me know that they their</p>

<p begin="00:12:48.570" end="00:12:54.270" style="s2">with wine and that alcibiades right</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.110" end="00:12:56.970" style="s2">Rudolf on pain of death took it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.270" end="00:12:58.860" style="s2">threw a banging house party with it so</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.970" end="00:13:01.470" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay so we know it&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.860" end="00:13:04.520" style="s2">strong and a little ton of fun right and</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.470" end="00:13:07.230" style="s2">and that kicks off the Western ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.520" end="00:13:10.140" style="s2">tradition I think and many of the great</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.230" end="00:13:12.600" style="s2">thinkers of both Greece and Rome were</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.140" end="00:13:14.730" style="s2">initiates including Plato and I believe</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.600" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">Aristotle as well yeah although you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.730" end="00:13:18.450" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure about Aristotle and my</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:20.010" style="s2">particular actually I think it was so</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.450" end="00:13:22.140" style="s2">creates in Plato but you know but</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.010" end="00:13:24.210" style="s2">Aristotle I think this is my guerilla</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.140" end="00:13:27.090" style="s2">thesis which is I think that Aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.210" end="00:13:28.830" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hold his brew so he minded</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.090" end="00:13:30.060" style="s2">tried cuz think about their philosophies</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.830" end="00:13:31.740" style="s2">right I mean played it was like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:32.040" style="s2">this world of forms there&#39;s this super</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.740" end="00:13:33.209" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.040" end="00:13:34.860" style="s2">information layer you can launch up</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.209" end="00:13:36.360" style="s2">there everything is perfection you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.860" end="00:13:38.430" style="s2">manifest that down here on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.360" end="00:13:40.199" style="s2">lay on and Aristotle is like the only</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.430" end="00:13:42.930" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s real is what I can touch</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.199" end="00:13:44.970" style="s2">taste see or grab a bit more sure right</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.930" end="00:13:46.649" style="s2">and we got the Aristotelian Branch of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.970" end="00:13:49.050" style="s2">like the the tripper who couldn&#39;t hang</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.649" end="00:13:50.850" style="s2">and that became them the modern Western</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.050" end="00:13:52.079" style="s2">scientific tradition that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.850" end="00:13:54.029" style="s2">interesting theory I like that though I</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.079" end="00:13:56.730" style="s2">will put my cards on the table and say</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.029" end="00:13:59.130" style="s2">hey you know on that Big Fork platonic</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.730" end="00:14:01.709" style="s2">or Aristotelian I go interest aphelion</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.130" end="00:14:04.199" style="s2">every time right oh nice I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.709" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">I&#39;m like a vestigial Pythagorean by</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.199" end="00:14:08.850" style="s2">mistake I think that like it&#39;s taking me</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:10.170" style="s2">this long to like try and track down all</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.850" end="00:14:12.930" style="s2">the threat and be like you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.170" end="00:14:14.790" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s the main core like</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.930" end="00:14:17.160" style="s2">lineage core that I feel most affinity</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.649" end="00:14:23.610" style="s2">mean even some like hopped-up fatback</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:25.769" style="s2">cooking beans you know from Texas I</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.610" end="00:14:27.240" style="s2">could have a tablespoonful and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.769" end="00:14:28.529" style="s2">good well you may be a pythagorean</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.240" end="00:14:30.660" style="s2">because people don&#39;t know that what that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.529" end="00:14:33.389" style="s2">was the number one belief of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.660" end="00:14:34.980" style="s2">Pythagorean so that beans were evil hmm</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.389" end="00:14:37.380" style="s2">yeah well you never know you never know</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.980" end="00:14:38.610" style="s2">you can give you bunk with someone yeah</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.019" end="00:14:54.149" style="s2">were into wrestling and philosophy they</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.850" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">had a highly embodied kinetic mystic</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:01.079" style="s2">wish we knew more about him yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.290" end="00:15:03.750" style="s2">are all those pre-socratics were was</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.079" end="00:15:06.089" style="s2">Pythagoras pre-socratic yeah he was</p>

<p begin="00:15:06.089" end="00:15:09.240" style="s2">the whole thing I wish I&#39;d learned about</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.470" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">more about him later but I just thought</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:12.690" style="s2">it was his triangles and cool</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.310" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re not so of course you</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.690" end="00:15:15.689" style="s2">learn in school at the seals a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.310" end="00:15:17.250" style="s2">bit one of the things you talk about in</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.689" end="00:15:19.589" style="s2">the book and I think elsewhere is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.250" end="00:15:22.260" style="s2">something you call dynamic subordination</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.589" end="00:15:24.389" style="s2">yeah where leadership is fluid defined</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.260" end="00:15:25.949" style="s2">by conditions I sometimes called this</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.389" end="00:15:28.290" style="s2">role based leadership rather than</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.949" end="00:15:30.269" style="s2">position based leadership and to my mind</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.290" end="00:15:33.449" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s very game be in</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.269" end="00:15:35.790" style="s2">fact that Zion 2.0 podcast other day I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.449" end="00:15:38.310" style="s2">said something like this natural real</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.790" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">leaders will arise soft role based</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.310" end="00:15:42.600" style="s2">leaders rather than position based</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.459" style="s2">leaders someone says I&#39;m the president</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.600" end="00:15:45.930" style="s2">of game B I think everyone&#39;s gonna laugh</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.459" end="00:15:48.620" style="s2">and say you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.930" end="00:15:50.850" style="s2">game B you&#39;re a asshole right</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.620" end="00:15:53.430" style="s2">anyway you know tell us more about</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.850" end="00:15:57.330" style="s2">dynamic subordination and leadership</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.430" end="00:16:00.120" style="s2">that changes as the need arises yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.330" end="00:16:02.100" style="s2">mean I think you know pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.120" end="00:16:04.740" style="s2">key is is just that any form of</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.100" end="00:16:07.260" style="s2">structural hierarchy either is set aside</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.740" end="00:16:09.750" style="s2">or non-existent in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.260" end="00:16:11.850" style="s2">for who is sensing thinking feeling</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.750" end="00:16:13.710" style="s2">perceiving and then acting with them the</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.850" end="00:16:15.450" style="s2">you know the most information closest to</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.710" end="00:16:16.830" style="s2">real-time emergence like that person has</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.450" end="00:16:19.200" style="s2">literally become the tip of the spear</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.830" end="00:16:21.330" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a flock follow-on effect</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.200" end="00:16:23.100" style="s2">of opposing action so there&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.330" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">degree of coding it&#39;s not like well he</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.100" end="00:16:25.950" style="s2">just made something up now what do I do</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:27.690" style="s2">and you end up with you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.870" style="s2">Hokey Pokey or something it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.690" end="00:16:32.850" style="s2">discipline formation flying and action</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.870" end="00:16:36.690" style="s2">and so that allows them to basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.850" end="00:16:38.880" style="s2">offload into the you know the logic of</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.690" end="00:16:40.410" style="s2">the algorithm right they&#39;ve encoded a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.880" end="00:16:42.540" style="s2">kinetic battle plan and now they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.410" end="00:16:45.150" style="s2">acting it out moving through time and</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.540" end="00:16:47.550" style="s2">space in synchronized coordination but</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.150" end="00:16:49.380" style="s2">also real-time adaptation to novelty on</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.550" end="00:16:51.810" style="s2">the ground and yet somehow keeping that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.380" end="00:16:54.330" style="s2">coherent I mean it&#39;s been you know game</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.810" end="00:16:55.860" style="s2">five NBA Finals no-look passes and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.330" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">alley-oop dunks you know like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.860" end="00:16:59.880" style="s2">another one is there any weight for</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:02.460" style="s2">anything other than ultra elite people</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.880" end="00:17:05.670" style="s2">who spent 20,000 hours practicing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.460" end="00:17:08.459" style="s2">achieve that do you think I mean yes you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.670" end="00:17:08.910" style="s2">know I think you know macrame and</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.459" end="00:17:12.420" style="s2">ketamine</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.910" end="00:17:14.640" style="s2">you know Roberts your mother&#39;s brother I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.420" end="00:17:16.740" style="s2">mean you know the the point is that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.640" end="00:17:18.900" style="s2">think there&#39;s a ton of ways in and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.740" end="00:17:21.330" style="s2">actually in our research I think we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.900" end="00:17:24.810" style="s2">over I don&#39;t know how many maybe 20,000</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.330" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">30,000 maybe more psycho graphs of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.810" end="00:17:30.720" style="s2">people&#39;s flow profiles and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.520" style="s2">was 47 48 percent actually test is deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.720" end="00:17:35.070" style="s2">thinkers so that their way in is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.520" end="00:17:37.980" style="s2">actually more contemplative imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.070" end="00:17:40.620" style="s2">creative intellectual that whole realm</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.980" end="00:17:42.810" style="s2">was sort of interior &#39;ti is where they</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.620" end="00:17:45.000" style="s2">find their pathway through so it does</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.280" end="00:18:24.300" style="s2">elite guys have been able to achieve and</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.900" end="00:18:25.830" style="s2">well yeah but it&#39;s also way harder than</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.300" end="00:18:27.660" style="s2">it looks in the sense of it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.650" end="00:18:36.810" style="s2">know so it&#39;s the no corner offices no</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.390" end="00:18:41.400" style="s2">like sort of out in the hallways with</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:16.920" style="s2">and as you point out you know preserving</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.910" end="00:19:18.990" style="s2">that space is hard right because</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.920" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">unfortunately in our modern world</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.990" end="00:19:22.410" style="s2">particularly military guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.360" style="s2">they&#39;re everyone&#39;s trained to think that</p>

<p begin="00:19:28.950" end="00:19:35.490" style="s2">say that those guys are probably more</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.220" end="00:19:37.640" style="s2">internally motivated than than most you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.490" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">know like that is embracing the suck</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.640" end="00:19:43.530" style="s2">instead of a very very rare a very rare</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:45.390" style="s2">sense of satisfaction I think yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.530" end="00:19:47.100" style="s2">true that they are not into you know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.390" end="00:19:48.930" style="s2">big houses and the flashy cars because</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.100" end="00:19:51.570" style="s2">well these days and military officers</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.930" end="00:19:53.070" style="s2">paid a decent middle-class income you</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.570" end="00:19:55.020" style="s2">ain&#39;t getting rich that way and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.450" end="00:20:08.570" style="s2">saw that was remembering the book</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:10.740" style="s2">hierarchy in the forest by Chris Boehm</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.570" end="00:20:13.049" style="s2">anthropologist who has written an</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.740" end="00:20:15.600" style="s2">extraordinary book about</p>

<p begin="00:20:15.600" end="00:20:19.289" style="s2">the tendency to hierarchy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.460" end="00:20:21.239" style="s2">probably in our genes if we look at our</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.289" end="00:20:23.869" style="s2">close relatives both chimps and bonobos</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.239" end="00:20:25.529" style="s2">there&#39;s really rigid and really vicious</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.869" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">hierarchies that are different in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.529" end="00:20:30.029" style="s2">two species but they&#39;re very rigid</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:32.460" style="s2">hunter-gatherers apparently had no such</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.029" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">thing and what they did once they</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.460" end="00:20:36.059" style="s2">invented weapons is they there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:38.519" style="s2">apparently this was worldwide there was</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.059" end="00:20:41.850" style="s2">a commitment to take down big men who</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.519" end="00:20:43.799" style="s2">tried to usurp positions and the ability</p>

<p begin="00:20:47.779" end="00:20:51.690" style="s2">conjectural as all get-out like how on</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.889" end="00:20:54.029" style="s2">earth were they a son England&#39;s kinship</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.690" end="00:20:56.759" style="s2">structures and and big man Theory uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.029" end="00:20:58.139" style="s2">read the book didn&#39;t do they make a good</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.759" end="00:21:00.389" style="s2">case I think so</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.139" end="00:21:03.210" style="s2">I really do one best evidence we have</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.389" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">our existing hunter-gatherer peoples and</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.210" end="00:21:07.830" style="s2">he surveys a whole bunch of them and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.379" style="s2">looks at statistics on various</p>

<p begin="00:21:17.070" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">would strongly recommend how our</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:25.169" style="s2">ancestors developed an immune system two</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:27.239" style="s2">big men and something we obviously lost</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.169" end="00:21:30.659" style="s2">about twelve thousand years ago with the</p>

<p begin="00:21:30.659" end="00:21:34.739" style="s2">wonder I mean I honestly I truly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.789" end="00:21:37.049" style="s2">know and I mean my grad work was in sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.739" end="00:21:38.580" style="s2">of like narrow anthropology and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.049" end="00:21:41.519" style="s2">millenarian movements and a lot of proto</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.580" end="00:21:43.649" style="s2">your pian contact and that I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.519" end="00:21:47.190" style="s2">is it&#39;s such a fascinating inquiry and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.649" end="00:21:48.840" style="s2">I&#39;m also just you know like not sure how</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.190" end="00:21:50.850" style="s2">precise we can get about stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.840" end="00:21:52.049" style="s2">that old as far as cultural artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.850" end="00:21:54.779" style="s2">and upstreaming like going to</p>

<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:04.529" style="s2">have been way back when we also know</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.299" end="00:22:06.269" style="s2">it&#39;s there&#39;s some weird selection</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.529" end="00:22:07.710" style="s2">effects going on the last few are</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.269" end="00:22:10.619" style="s2">probably different than mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.710" end="00:22:13.200" style="s2">twenty thousand years ago yeah I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.619" end="00:22:13.710" style="s2">it is amazing how far we&#39;ve come out</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.200" end="00:22:15.869" style="s2">fast</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.710" end="00:22:17.009" style="s2">a little staggering kind of spooky but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.869" end="00:22:19.529" style="s2">mean holy these little naked</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.009" end="00:22:21.720" style="s2">monkeys with clothes men exactly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.529" end="00:22:23.279" style="s2">even more so in the last you know three</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.720" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">hundred years or so it&#39;s just like what</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.279" end="00:22:26.519" style="s2">the hell we&#39;re going straight up and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:27.170" style="s2">whether that&#39;ll kill us or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.519" end="00:22:30.100" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.170" end="00:22:32.690" style="s2">but we found an accidental stash of</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.100" end="00:22:35.300" style="s2">fossilized sunlight so we basically just</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.690" end="00:22:37.430" style="s2">onion in the in the petrol era</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.300" end="00:22:39.410" style="s2">we&#39;ve just unlocked millions of years of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.430" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">loaded starlight and have been just</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.410" end="00:22:43.700" style="s2">spraying it all around the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.230" style="s2">been a good ride and probably there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.700" end="00:22:48.410" style="s2">enough of it to let us get to the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.230" end="00:22:51.680" style="s2">level which is some combination of solar</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.410" end="00:22:54.920" style="s2">and nuclear and wind etc that windfall</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.680" end="00:22:57.650" style="s2">of petrified dinosaurs or whatever seems</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.920" end="00:22:59.150" style="s2">like it if we&#39;re not stupid too is big</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.650" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">enough for us to get to the other side</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.150" end="00:23:02.420" style="s2">where we won&#39;t need it anymore that</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:03.530" style="s2">would be right that would be cool you</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.420" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">know let&#39;s go back to something that has</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.530" end="00:23:07.880" style="s2">big bearings on again how to think about</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:10.160" style="s2">game B and I think about what comes next</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.880" end="00:23:12.260" style="s2">in terms of a society one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.160" end="00:23:14.210" style="s2">you talk a lot about with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.260" end="00:23:17.090" style="s2">seals we also talk about with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.210" end="00:23:20.240" style="s2">some MBA students is that there seems to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.090" end="00:23:22.460" style="s2">be a very narrow selection keyhole type</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.240" end="00:23:24.560" style="s2">selection for these kinds of groups in</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.460" end="00:23:27.620" style="s2">terms of leadership the number that are</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.560" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">filtered out are astronomical and so</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.620" end="00:23:30.980" style="s2">again I&#39;ll come back to the fact do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.890" style="s2">think these skills and types are</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.980" end="00:23:35.990" style="s2">inherently rare or is it that our</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.890" end="00:23:38.480" style="s2">society has been such that not many have</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.990" end="00:23:40.100" style="s2">been made maybe in a better society we</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.480" end="00:23:42.710" style="s2">can build more people that are capable</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.100" end="00:23:45.290" style="s2">of this position based dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.710" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2">subordination yeah I mean my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.290" end="00:23:48.290" style="s2">because I mean I&#39;ve been thinking a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:51.020" style="s2">about this lately in conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.290" end="00:23:53.570" style="s2">Jordan and Daniel and Bonita and others</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.020" end="00:23:55.370" style="s2">and my sense is there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.570" end="00:23:58.490" style="s2">value systems at play so if you look for</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.370" end="00:24:00.220" style="s2">like hey really dropping into high hyper</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.490" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">coordinated group flow is a very rare</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.220" end="00:24:04.250" style="s2">specific task with tons of attrition and</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.350" style="s2">tons of overtraining required to bring</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.250" end="00:24:08.570" style="s2">it about in most even elite populations</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.350" end="00:24:10.130" style="s2">then the question becomes how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.570" end="00:24:11.630" style="s2">this communally how do we do this where</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.130" end="00:24:13.160" style="s2">everybody&#39;s involved how do we do this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.630" end="00:24:14.360" style="s2">where everybody&#39;s on the bus and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.160" end="00:24:16.580" style="s2">a commitment that nobody gets dropped</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.360" end="00:24:19.070" style="s2">and coordinating that is often a</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.580" end="00:24:21.230" style="s2">progressive lefty shitshow you know by</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.070" end="00:24:23.210" style="s2">any other term and and they never get</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.230" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">off the ground so there are these two</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.210" end="00:24:28.160" style="s2">competing holes of values that&#39;s one is</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:29.900" style="s2">thick extrinsic value can you do the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.160" end="00:24:31.550" style="s2">thing and if you&#39;re a seal if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.900" end="00:24:33.110" style="s2">pro basketball player if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.550" end="00:24:35.540" style="s2">you&#39;re you know Miles Davis is drummer</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.110" end="00:24:36.830" style="s2">you know you either know how to swing or</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.540" end="00:24:39.560" style="s2">you don&#39;t and they get someone who can</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.830" end="00:24:40.410" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s pure extrinsic value</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.560" end="00:24:41.430" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.410" end="00:24:43.620" style="s2">then on the other side like we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.430" end="00:24:45.240" style="s2">community we&#39;re an organization this you</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.620" end="00:24:47.070" style="s2">know consensus having everybody&#39;s voice</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.240" end="00:24:48.030" style="s2">having diversity all having inclusion</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.070" end="00:24:50.820" style="s2">having all those things are things we</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.030" end="00:24:52.560" style="s2">really value then it can often be really</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.820" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">hard to get off the ground so the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.560" end="00:24:56.760" style="s2">question is is is there the both and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:58.650" style="s2">right of coherence which which would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.760" end="00:25:00.570" style="s2">balancing those two polarities in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.650" end="00:25:03.390" style="s2">sense and this is like Laszlo Bock at</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.570" end="00:25:05.250" style="s2">Google and and you know the in fact Mike</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.390" end="00:25:06.870" style="s2">Gervaise everybody who&#39;s this the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.250" end="00:25:08.160" style="s2">performance psychologist for the Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.870" end="00:25:09.810" style="s2">Seahawks right then they&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.160" end="00:25:12.450" style="s2">same thing and won Super Bowls that way</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.810" end="00:25:13.890" style="s2">but it&#39;s a culture of safety a culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.450" end="00:25:16.170" style="s2">of risk-taking a culture where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.890" end="00:25:17.880" style="s2">engines occur is affirm that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.170" end="00:25:20.220" style="s2">actually feels it in their nervous</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.880" end="00:25:23.670" style="s2">systems and at the same time there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.220" end="00:25:26.250" style="s2">starting 11 on any given Sunday and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.670" end="00:25:28.440" style="s2">we also hold that that capacity that +</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.250" end="00:25:31.800" style="s2">dynamic subordination feels like a sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.440" end="00:25:35.280" style="s2">of potential provisional set of like you</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.800" end="00:25:37.170" style="s2">know guidelines or protocols for kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.130" end="00:27:14.040" style="s2">that is a tremendous responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.890" end="00:27:16.260" style="s2">imperative and they held that so</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.040" end="00:27:18.630" style="s2">strongly that they actually guide a</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.260" end="00:27:22.260" style="s2">majority of those young men through that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.630" end="00:27:24.510" style="s2">and at the same time even though I you</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.510" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">Development and training I kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.330" end="00:27:32.910" style="s2">that you either have an unbendable</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.860" end="00:27:35.160" style="s2">integrity or you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:36.360" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve you find those folks</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.160" end="00:27:37.950" style="s2">that&#39;s the nature pot and then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.360" end="00:27:40.440" style="s2">nurture the hell out of those who have</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.950" end="00:27:42.060" style="s2">that ineffable core quality and I know</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.440" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">that sounds essentialist reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.060" end="00:27:45.990" style="s2">about you whatever but you sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:48.090" style="s2">I&#39;ve never liked the seals have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.990" end="00:27:49.530" style="s2">that Bell that they ring at Budds if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.090" end="00:27:51.720" style="s2">want to quit right so there&#39;s the brass</p>

<p begin="00:27:51.720" end="00:27:54.390" style="s2">being taunted and baited and encouraged</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.400" end="00:27:55.890" style="s2">to go out there and just ring the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.390" end="00:27:57.750" style="s2"> thing and it&#39;ll all be over and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.890" end="00:28:00.300" style="s2">then when they do somewhere in the last</p>

<p begin="00:29:21.430" end="00:29:25.600" style="s2">know once game B is far enough along</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.020" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">that it has game B child rearing for</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.600" end="00:29:29.980" style="s2">infants mm-hmm very young children and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:34.290" style="s2">game B education for older kids I</p>

<p begin="00:29:36.850" end="00:29:42.360" style="s2">you can probably inculcate it in most if</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.580" end="00:29:44.800" style="s2">not quite everybody oh that&#39;s been the</p>

<p begin="00:29:49.180" end="00:29:54.940" style="s2">realize it&#39;s way trickier than look that</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:59.080" style="s2">is true Here I am violating ruts no new</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.940" end="00:30:01.270" style="s2">man hypothesis right but so so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.080" end="00:30:05.260" style="s2">actually have an empirical question is</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.270" end="00:30:06.760" style="s2">the core capability integrity found in</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.260" end="00:30:08.860" style="s2">everybody or can it be nurtured and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.760" end="00:30:12.730" style="s2">everybody from adulthood onward if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.860" end="00:30:15.010" style="s2">answer is yes fine the answer is no then</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.730" end="00:30:16.810" style="s2">game B has to have a fairly tight funnel</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.010" end="00:30:19.990" style="s2">to only bring in people who are in</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.810" end="00:30:20.800" style="s2">integrity as adults and try to go yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.990" end="00:30:23.170" style="s2">that file that one under</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.800" end="00:30:24.460" style="s2">abso-fucking-lutely yeah and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.170" end="00:30:25.870" style="s2">know if we know the answer that yeah by</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.460" end="00:30:27.700" style="s2">there I do agree with Jordan that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.870" end="00:30:29.410" style="s2">integrity or what we used to call</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.700" end="00:30:31.000" style="s2">honesty in good faith I think his</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.410" end="00:30:33.610" style="s2">concept of integrity now is a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.000" end="00:30:35.890" style="s2">broader is absolutely the bedrock on</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.610" end="00:30:37.690" style="s2">which game B has to be built and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.890" end="00:30:39.220" style="s2">you know if it turns out that it is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.690" end="00:30:41.440" style="s2">we do have to be selective then the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.220" end="00:30:44.680" style="s2">question is can we without turning into</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.440" end="00:30:46.570" style="s2">utopian assholes provide a culture that</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.680" end="00:30:48.850" style="s2">a much higher percentage of the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.570" end="00:30:51.370" style="s2">generation that comes up in the proto</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.850" end="00:30:54.910" style="s2">game B culture haven&#39;t as their</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.370" end="00:30:56.680" style="s2">foundation integrity yeah yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.910" end="00:31:00.190" style="s2">obviously in the Devils are in those</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.680" end="00:31:01.240" style="s2">deets so the question is how to have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.190" end="00:31:03.190" style="s2">enforce it now what I wonder is it</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.240" end="00:31:04.840" style="s2">sounds like yeah you you if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.190" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">a sort of decentralized organization</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.840" end="00:31:09.340" style="s2">there is that that also is a poll of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:12.610" style="s2">decentralized pot and the organized pot</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.340" end="00:31:13.930" style="s2">and you know do you go like articles of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.610" end="00:31:16.450" style="s2">confederation and the loose</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.930" end="00:31:18.640" style="s2">confederation of early colonies and but</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.450" end="00:31:20.620" style="s2">you cement it with a contemporary loose</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.640" end="00:31:24.190" style="s2">in Ian mystery so you get high</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.620" end="00:31:25.540" style="s2">coherence with looser governance than we</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.190" end="00:31:27.309" style="s2">were able to pull off the first time</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.540" end="00:31:28.900" style="s2">around yeah well what sure is that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.309" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">kind of thing you&#39;re imagining I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.900" end="00:31:33.370" style="s2">mean yeah something like that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:34.630" style="s2">the term I try to have been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.370" end="00:31:37.540" style="s2">get out into the world a little bit what</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.630" end="00:31:40.090" style="s2">I call coherent pluralism which is there</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.540" end="00:31:41.230" style="s2">is a core really strong coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.090" end="00:31:44.260" style="s2">maybe it is something completely</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.230" end="00:31:46.420" style="s2">subjective like a mystery or maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.260" end="00:31:49.180" style="s2">a series of doctrines like the founding</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.420" end="00:31:51.340" style="s2">fathers but this is the key is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.180" end="00:31:54.250" style="s2">too all-encompassing so it leaves room</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.340" end="00:31:55.960" style="s2">for lots of variety so you know for</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.250" end="00:31:58.929" style="s2">instance if you want to believe in one</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.960" end="00:31:59.260" style="s2">of the old hoary religions go right</p>

<p begin="00:32:09.640" end="00:32:14.770" style="s2">you will so long as you don&#39;t violate</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.290" end="00:32:16.570" style="s2">the core and that sounds cruel Ian more</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.770" end="00:32:18.429" style="s2">than more than Jeffersonian but you know</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.540" end="00:32:29.140" style="s2">know it strikes me that if we look you</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.520" end="00:32:31.330" style="s2">know just in a caricature version of our</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.140" end="00:32:33.940" style="s2">left and our right today you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.330" end="00:32:36.130" style="s2">right wants to give a very long list the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.940" end="00:32:37.750" style="s2">prescriptions of what thou shalt do and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.130" end="00:32:39.910" style="s2">thou shalt not do you know very</p>

<p begin="00:32:55.720" end="00:33:00.309" style="s2">right answer is something in between</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.300" end="00:33:02.020" style="s2">which is we&#39;re not we are gonna be a</p>

<p begin="00:35:20.570" end="00:35:23.780" style="s2">that stands against fashion isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.860" end="00:35:25.940" style="s2">the Western tradition to now through</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.780" end="00:35:27.830" style="s2">here like let&#39;s dust that off and</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.460" end="00:35:41.690" style="s2">it in passing to my mind this is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.140" end="00:35:43.970" style="s2">other critical one we must fight to</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.690" end="00:35:46.040" style="s2">preserve the Enlightenment now yes the</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.970" end="00:35:47.150" style="s2">Enlightenment was full of the bigotries</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.040" end="00:35:49.519" style="s2">of its age</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.150" end="00:35:52.460" style="s2">but it made such a difference in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.519" end="00:35:55.220" style="s2">transition from essentially the past the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.460" end="00:35:57.799" style="s2">world dominated by superstition with no</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.799" end="00:36:01.999" style="s2">world where we had developed a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.180" end="00:36:04.700" style="s2">or we can actually find incremental e</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.999" end="00:36:06.259" style="s2">and never perfectly movement towards</p>

<p begin="00:36:06.259" end="00:36:10.940" style="s2">and we have you know the idiot</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.569" end="00:36:13.670" style="s2">postmodernists on the left we have the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.940" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">rigid reactionaries on the right both of</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:39.859" style="s2">stuff but this is sort of a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.519" end="00:37:42.859" style="s2">years in the rear view mirror from the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.859" end="00:37:45.499" style="s2">things that were actively thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.859" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">now it all builds on it 100% all right</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.499" end="00:37:48.039" style="s2"> you the path then let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:50.029" style="s2">what are you thinking about right now</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.039" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">well I mean how about this that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.029" end="00:37:53.779" style="s2">notion that ecstatic technologies like</p>

<p begin="00:37:59.150" end="00:38:04.280" style="s2">and culture right and the challenges</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.850" end="00:38:07.430" style="s2">were threefold one was weaponization</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.280" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">the other was commercialization and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.430" end="00:38:11.540" style="s2">the third was sort of he denies ation</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:14.600" style="s2">you know they&#39;re getting hijacked by our</p>

<p begin="00:38:14.600" end="00:38:19.070" style="s2">see that playing forward now right into</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.210" end="00:38:20.870" style="s2">everything from the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.070" end="00:38:23.090" style="s2">Renaissance and the big move of venture</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.310" end="00:38:35.630" style="s2">sorts of ripples and sort of</p>

<p begin="00:38:44.560" end="00:38:50.180" style="s2">MDMA so there&#39;s literally a modern-day</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.040" end="00:44:52.420" style="s2">out the other day that shows that high</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.050" end="00:44:55.540" style="s2">empathy also seems to be strongly</p>

<p begin="00:45:03.220" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">empathy in general it&#39;s more effective</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.320" end="00:45:10.060" style="s2">within the tribe and so people who have</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.230" end="00:45:12.880" style="s2">really strong empathy for their tribe</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.310" end="00:47:26.140" style="s2">unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.490" end="00:47:27.940" style="s2">and yes the current world sucks but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.140" end="00:47:30.820" style="s2">yeah well it does not suck so bad that</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.940" end="00:47:33.220" style="s2">we really wanted to drop five levels of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.820" end="00:47:35.710" style="s2">civilization in you know three years and</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.220" end="00:47:37.990" style="s2">watch you know 250 million people in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.710" end="00:47:39.790" style="s2">United States alone died you know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.990" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">actually would be the best case would be</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.790" end="00:47:44.560" style="s2">that give us some time to build many of</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:46.780" style="s2">the peace parts and even done some proto</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.560" end="00:47:48.940" style="s2">game B communities to demonstrate what</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.780" end="00:47:51.070" style="s2">works from the social side and some of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.940" end="00:47:52.840" style="s2">it won&#39;t work and then having a soft</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.070" end="00:47:54.580" style="s2">collapse like a financial collapse you</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.840" end="00:47:56.170" style="s2">know financial collapse not that big a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.580" end="00:47:57.520" style="s2">deal look at you know like the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.170" end="00:48:00.220" style="s2">Union had what was essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.520" end="00:48:02.140" style="s2">financial and regime collapse nobody</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.220" end="00:48:04.390" style="s2">died yeah life sucked for a few years</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.140" end="00:48:05.830" style="s2">unfortunately they got caught by a bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.390" end="00:48:07.360" style="s2">attractor that was worse</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.830" end="00:48:09.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it worse than the one they were</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.360" end="00:48:10.840" style="s2">in but it wasn&#39;t as good as it could</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.220" end="00:48:13.450" style="s2">have been by any means they fell into</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.840" end="00:48:15.580" style="s2">the neo-fascist attractor rather than</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.450" end="00:48:17.290" style="s2">into one of the better attractors well</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.580" end="00:48:18.820" style="s2">exactly that&#39;s also a case study right I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.290" end="00:48:20.830" style="s2">mean those who still control the engines</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.820" end="00:48:22.150" style="s2">of war like Milosevic didn&#39;t Serbia you</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.830" end="00:48:23.830" style="s2">know like if he had in the military</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.150" end="00:48:26.560" style="s2">therefore he wasn&#39;t he was able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.830" end="00:48:29.590" style="s2">project force you know so like as things</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.560" end="00:48:31.090" style="s2">as things unspool you realized that</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.590" end="00:48:32.710" style="s2">those things are gonna be have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.090" end="00:48:35.320" style="s2">dealt with on basically feudal level</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.710" end="00:48:37.540" style="s2">dynamics if things fall that&#39;s how far</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.320" end="00:48:39.250" style="s2">they fall right well then yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.540" end="00:48:41.170" style="s2">think as things fell apart you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.250" end="00:48:42.970" style="s2">nobody paid much attention I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.170" end="00:48:45.310" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem with Anarchy right I</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.970" end="00:48:46.810" style="s2">read these arguments for an archaic dude</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.310" end="00:48:48.850" style="s2">come on let&#39;s look at history we know</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.810" end="00:48:52.090" style="s2">how Anarchy really goes first it goes to</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.850" end="00:48:54.820" style="s2">criminal gangs then warlords and then a</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.090" end="00:48:57.400" style="s2">master Lord warlord crowns himself King</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.820" end="00:48:59.260" style="s2">yeah no no I mean you know it&#39;s human</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.400" end="00:49:01.300" style="s2">human history is fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.260" end="00:49:02.770" style="s2">the modes and models that we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.300" end="00:49:04.390" style="s2">grown up with and taking this table</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.770" end="00:49:06.040" style="s2">stakes and seeing regurgitated and I in</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.390" end="00:49:09.070" style="s2">our kids history books is this a</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.040" end="00:49:12.369" style="s2">fleeting fiction you know which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.070" end="00:49:14.970" style="s2">just a temporary wobbly Mirage on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.369" end="00:49:17.680" style="s2">you know arc of human culture and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.970" end="00:49:20.050" style="s2">civilization development with freaks I</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.680" end="00:49:23.320" style="s2">know you took it as table stakes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.050" end="00:49:25.480" style="s2">you know since 1694 basically all right</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.320" end="00:49:26.890" style="s2">let&#39;s switch back here now use last bit</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.480" end="00:49:29.140" style="s2">of our time or so we can really get into</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.890" end="00:49:31.890" style="s2">your expertise you know you know about a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.140" end="00:49:35.170" style="s2">lot of what&#39;s going on in pharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.890" end="00:49:37.810" style="s2">technology neurobiology etc what do you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.170" end="00:49:40.180" style="s2">see that&#39;s out there either proven or</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.810" end="00:49:42.550" style="s2">advanced in the lab and that the R&amp;D</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.180" end="00:49:45.130" style="s2">level that might help make this</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.550" end="00:49:47.530" style="s2">conversion to a better world happen</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.130" end="00:49:48.940" style="s2">faster and better yeah well I think you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.530" end="00:49:52.150" style="s2">basically just put them all together and</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.940" end="00:49:54.910" style="s2">build badass chambers to like boot up</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.150" end="00:49:57.369" style="s2">you know like next level humans you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.910" end="00:50:00.010" style="s2">you just combine all integrative trauma</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.369" end="00:50:02.890" style="s2">release therapies you make use of</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.010" end="00:50:06.520" style="s2">schedule three four compounds and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.890" end="00:50:08.470" style="s2">integrate light sound music massages</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.520" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">like it like an automated Japanese</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.470" end="00:50:14.650" style="s2">massage chair gravity blankets for vague</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:17.260" style="s2">on the tone etc etc and then you you</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.650" end="00:50:19.780" style="s2">basically dial people through a neuro</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.260" end="00:50:20.740" style="s2">physiologically programmed synchronized</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.780" end="00:50:23.470" style="s2">consumption of prescription</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.740" end="00:50:24.940" style="s2">pharmaceuticals that deliver a you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.470" end="00:50:27.310" style="s2">and and a breathing protocol in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.940" end="00:50:30.369" style="s2">whole bit that deliver a peak energetic</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.310" end="00:50:32.109" style="s2">pulse and release with whatever interior</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.369" end="00:50:33.609" style="s2">psychological content shows up for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.109" end="00:50:35.079" style="s2">person they get to make sense of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.609" end="00:50:37.720" style="s2">themselves that&#39;s their own data set and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.079" end="00:50:40.839" style="s2">you use it to defrag nervous systems and</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.720" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">then boot up post conventional thinking</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.839" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">in basically particularly theta gamma</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.079" end="00:50:49.720" style="s2">and waking Delta EEG signatures so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:52.240" style="s2">basically just steer the self over to</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.720" end="00:50:55.060" style="s2">that place make sense like process at</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.240" end="00:50:57.190" style="s2">high velocity information lateral</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.060" end="00:50:58.690" style="s2">connections patterns meaning making into</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.190" end="00:51:02.560" style="s2">relationships and then come back down</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.690" end="00:51:04.420" style="s2">with a kernel or a crystal of you know a</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.560" end="00:51:05.950" style="s2">thesis in you know information research</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.420" end="00:51:09.160" style="s2">branches and arms that you can then</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.950" end="00:51:11.369" style="s2">follow up on and instantiate in 3d so</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.160" end="00:51:13.120" style="s2">that to me seems like a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.369" end="00:51:16.060" style="s2">necessary</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.120" end="00:51:17.530" style="s2">no adaptive innovation it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.060" end="00:51:19.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a control system there too</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.530" end="00:51:21.670" style="s2">though you need to make sure that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.540" end="00:51:24.430" style="s2">use the state correctly and don&#39;t wallow</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.670" end="00:51:26.920" style="s2">in it don&#39;t burn yourself out etc oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.430" end="00:51:29.590" style="s2">yeah you have so you have periodization</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.920" end="00:51:30.910" style="s2">and certain protocols almost like diving</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.590" end="00:51:32.710" style="s2">and the rules for the bends and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.910" end="00:51:36.040" style="s2">ascending and that kind of thing so you</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.710" end="00:51:38.110" style="s2">absolutely have that on Rails and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.040" end="00:51:40.210" style="s2">then the other part is also a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.110" end="00:51:41.830" style="s2">percent acknowledge that like those</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.210" end="00:51:46.090" style="s2">reformatting technology psycho</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.830" end="00:51:50.050" style="s2">technologies right pretty much with few</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.090" end="00:51:53.890" style="s2">variations identical for basically you</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.050" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">know 21st century Western alchemy or you</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.890" end="00:51:58.030" style="s2">know spook black-budget</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:52:00.580" style="s2">brainwashing yeah or paestum what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.030" end="00:52:04.510" style="s2">just that the latter is design intended</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.580" end="00:52:09.010" style="s2">to dissolve sovereignty and the former</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.510" end="00:52:11.560" style="s2">is intended to galvanize it okay how far</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.010" end="00:52:13.660" style="s2">along is the experimentation with this</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.560" end="00:52:14.890" style="s2">multi-part approach that you&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.660" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">about are you do you know anyone that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.890" end="00:52:18.100" style="s2">actually doing this uh yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:19.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.100" end="00:52:24.730" style="s2">of experimentation and innovation going</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.930" end="00:52:27.340" style="s2">on much of it in the I would I suppose</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.730" end="00:52:29.140" style="s2">the kind of EDM transformational</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.340" end="00:52:32.380" style="s2">festival scene because there&#39;s a real</p>

<p begin="00:52:32.380" end="00:52:37.000" style="s2">biometrics that kind of thing so sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.080" end="00:52:40.570" style="s2">interactive experience or biometrically</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.000" end="00:52:42.850" style="s2">queued or indexed experiments piece of</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.620" end="00:52:47.500" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a fascinating field and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.480" end="00:52:51.880" style="s2">really interesting is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.500" end="00:52:54.730" style="s2">absolutely program a peak state of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.880" end="00:52:57.100" style="s2">know whatever five minutes to 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.730" end="00:52:59.170" style="s2">dial it up dial it down not send people</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.100" end="00:53:01.620" style="s2">out the door on a feather and they can</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.170" end="00:53:05.710" style="s2">use it as a post conventional</p>

<p begin="00:53:09.460" end="00:53:14.290" style="s2">know I try to be a practical guy if</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.320" end="00:53:16.870" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to build game be mmm how</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.290" end="00:53:18.940" style="s2">might we use that well because all the</p>

<p begin="00:53:47.019" end="00:53:51.700" style="s2">there&#39;s the first proto game b group of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.509" end="00:53:54.130" style="s2">200 people that go out and decide to</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.700" end="00:53:55.479" style="s2">build a game b village somewhere would</p>

<p begin="00:54:06.359" end="00:54:11.079" style="s2">yeah I mean I mean yes sure of course it</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.759" end="00:54:14.259" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be this it could be any</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.420" end="00:54:22.299" style="s2">their life it&#39;s just absent that and</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.710" end="00:54:23.890" style="s2">with a little bit of tech assist and a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.299" end="00:54:26.170" style="s2">little bit of fun instructional design</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.890" end="00:54:30.579" style="s2">you can also just pour this one in but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.170" end="00:54:32.769" style="s2">mean it includes basically what we need</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.579" end="00:54:35.529" style="s2">I think these days and more soon is</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.769" end="00:54:37.950" style="s2">going to be highly highly coherent</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.529" end="00:54:40.719" style="s2">highly highly resilient high integrity</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.950" end="00:54:44.140" style="s2">leaders who are completely surrendered</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.719" end="00:54:47.559" style="s2">to mission and and selfless service and</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.140" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">to playing by the the highest</p>

<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:54.039" style="s2">policing when we don&#39;t and that rent and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.359" end="00:54:56.519" style="s2">that requires that you know that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.039" end="00:54:59.529" style="s2">lend itself to burnout reactivity</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.519" end="00:55:03.009" style="s2">retrigger trauma etc etc so healing and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.529" end="00:55:04.599" style="s2">rejuvenation are critical to then do all</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.009" end="00:55:05.619" style="s2">the other huh 3d you&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.599" end="00:55:08.289" style="s2">so all I&#39;m talking about it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.619" end="00:55:10.569" style="s2">what&#39;s the psychosocial software to map</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.289" end="00:55:12.190" style="s2">to the techno-economic stuff that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.569" end="00:55:13.900" style="s2">thinking about that what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.190" end="00:55:16.239" style="s2">get at should this be cooked in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.900" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">essentially to the you know the initial</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.239" end="00:55:20.950" style="s2">boot program and it sounds like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:23.229" style="s2">a good argument that it would help the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.950" end="00:55:24.789" style="s2">boot program be more successful yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.229" end="00:55:26.200" style="s2">you know I mean YouTube being culture is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.789" end="00:55:27.789" style="s2">tricky because then you almost always</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.200" end="00:55:29.229" style="s2">end up back to teach the children right</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.789" end="00:55:30.759" style="s2">you&#39;re like oh it&#39;s so hard once adults</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.229" end="00:55:32.049" style="s2">are baked they have these all these bad</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.759" end="00:55:33.880" style="s2">habits we don&#39;t want them anymore and</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.049" end="00:55:35.769" style="s2">then eventually we start fantasizing</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.880" end="00:55:37.710" style="s2">about what what we really need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.769" end="00:55:40.170" style="s2">get the kids first then it&#39;ll be alright</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.710" end="00:55:42.330" style="s2">right and if you do that then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.170" end="00:55:44.220" style="s2">like it&#39;s actually you get a</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.330" end="00:55:46.080" style="s2">double-edged sword because unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.220" end="00:55:48.089" style="s2">truly putting your kids out of all</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.080" end="00:55:49.770" style="s2">mainstream society then the better you</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.089" end="00:55:52.020" style="s2">do it raise them in game B or any other</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.770" end="00:55:54.270" style="s2">utopian experimenter experience so worse</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.020" end="00:55:57.510" style="s2">they fit so you are wounding the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.270" end="00:56:01.170" style="s2">children you love the most by making</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.510" end="00:56:03.810" style="s2">them misfits right on you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.170" end="00:56:05.460" style="s2">island of toys like and and and that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.810" end="00:56:06.900" style="s2">a brutal thing or you&#39;re like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.460" end="00:56:08.460" style="s2">leaving it behind we&#39;re never looking</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.900" end="00:56:11.010" style="s2">back so it won&#39;t matter and then you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.460" end="00:56:13.200" style="s2">gone full bore prepper so you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.010" end="00:56:16.109" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot to impart or inflict on a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.200" end="00:56:18.630" style="s2">child some come out amazingly out of</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.109" end="00:56:20.400" style="s2">super alternative lives and then others</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.630" end="00:56:23.460" style="s2">make a transition that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.400" end="00:56:26.160" style="s2">bumpier I think an interesting data is</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.460" end="00:56:28.740" style="s2">that the Israeli kibbutz which is one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.160" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">the more successful alternative micro</p>

<p begin="00:59:36.290" end="00:59:39.950" style="s2">conventional sense of the collective</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.700" end="00:59:42.320" style="s2">right either erosion and loss of self</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.950" end="00:59:44.960" style="s2">right or you know deepening connecting</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.320" end="00:59:47.120" style="s2">and amplifying itself it depends but</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.960" end="00:59:48.560" style="s2">anytime you do either of those you get</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.120" end="00:59:51.080" style="s2">all the other tribal monkeys in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.560" end="00:59:53.270" style="s2">circuit you to imprint on that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.080" end="00:59:55.400" style="s2">Hierophant like little ducklings there</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.270" end="00:59:57.410" style="s2">like that is the source of it all and</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.400" end="00:59:58.850" style="s2">then how many of those folks because</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.410" end="01:00:00.110" style="s2">they could be idiot savants they can be</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.850" end="01:00:01.280" style="s2">hucksters in shysters they could think</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.110" end="01:00:04.310" style="s2">and they could be quick studies they can</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.280" end="01:00:04.790" style="s2">be you know uh Naturals but how many of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.310" end="01:00:07.190" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.790" end="01:00:08.330" style="s2">give it all back you know it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.190" end="01:00:09.650" style="s2">bit like winning the lottery like if</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.330" end="01:00:11.030" style="s2">anybody wins the lottery like do they</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.650" end="01:00:12.710" style="s2">rat do they say hey man there but for</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.030" end="01:00:14.330" style="s2">the grace of God you know let it pass</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.710" end="01:00:16.850" style="s2">through my life let me distribute it to</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.330" end="01:00:18.350" style="s2">everybody I don&#39;t I was fine yesterday I</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.850" end="01:00:21.320" style="s2">won the lottery today do I need to keep</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.350" end="01:00:22.880" style="s2">any of it you know and so those gurus</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.320" end="01:00:24.560" style="s2">with feet of clay it feels like they</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.880" end="01:00:25.640" style="s2">probably hold on to some of the light</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.560" end="01:00:27.620" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the butt you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.640" end="01:00:30.020" style="s2">metabolic output of the collective and</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.620" end="01:00:32.300" style="s2">in doing so right it corrupts them</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.020" end="01:00:34.100" style="s2">slowly over time but inevitably or maybe</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.300" end="01:00:36.350" style="s2">not so slowly some of them as you say or</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.100" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">you know probably even if they were into</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.350" end="01:00:40.670" style="s2">it explicitly as con men they quickly</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:43.010" style="s2">fall into it right see that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.670" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">I I think that that is a category for</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.010" end="01:00:48.160" style="s2">sure at the basest least discerning</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:51.620" style="s2">level like like cut rate you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.160" end="01:00:53.450" style="s2">megachurch ministers you know but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.620" end="01:00:55.310" style="s2">reality is is that the more interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.450" end="01:00:57.950" style="s2">cases are ones of people who had</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.310" end="01:01:00.230" style="s2">absolutely absolute juice otherwise they</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.950" end="01:01:02.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t have possibly done what they</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.230" end="01:01:04.310" style="s2">did or gathered the people they gathered</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.570" end="01:01:07.850" style="s2">all right so the question is is how do</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.310" end="01:01:09.500" style="s2">you get these basically you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.850" end="01:01:11.120" style="s2">that old Tolkien thing of you know no</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.500" end="01:01:13.330" style="s2">doubt you know or every Dark Wizard</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.120" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">started out in the pursuit of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.330" end="01:01:18.290" style="s2">that is true yep and I would put it in</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:20.780" style="s2">the category of another immune system</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.290" end="01:01:22.580" style="s2">the game be has to build for itself you</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.780" end="01:01:24.830" style="s2">know we have to have an immune system</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.580" end="01:01:26.630" style="s2">against spiritual bypass we have an</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.830" end="01:01:28.940" style="s2">immune system about trapping our</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.630" end="01:01:30.860" style="s2">children in a you know an impossible</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.940" end="01:01:33.140" style="s2">situation from which they can&#39;t get out</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.860" end="01:01:35.360" style="s2">and can&#39;t move forward and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.140" end="01:01:38.330" style="s2">have an immune system against the Guru&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.360" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">quacks and Swami&#39;s right yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.330" end="01:01:40.850" style="s2">yeah but of course I mean that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:42.140" style="s2">trick right I mean that&#39;s baked into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.850" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">Book of Revelations and the Antichrist</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.140" end="01:01:45.290" style="s2">is gonna walk like a Christ he&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:47.630" style="s2">talk like a Christ but he&#39;s gonna be the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.290" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">Antichrist all right so we always have</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.630" end="01:01:51.890" style="s2">the ability to vilify the other in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.790" end="01:01:53.870" style="s2">name of the you know upholding that</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.890" end="01:01:56.210" style="s2">ourselves described standards of purity</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.870" end="01:01:58.460" style="s2">you know so like so that&#39;s the trick I</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.210" end="01:01:59.990" style="s2">mean a I think even just naming</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.460" end="01:02:01.880" style="s2">something like game be pretty is</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.990" end="01:02:03.710" style="s2">presumptive it&#39;s like it&#39;s like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.880" end="01:02:05.780" style="s2">gonna keep evolving culture and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.710" end="01:02:07.400" style="s2">happening in real time whether we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.780" end="01:02:09.380" style="s2">discussing it on a podcast or whether</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.400" end="01:02:12.380" style="s2">it&#39;s just happening all around us in a</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.380" end="01:02:13.730" style="s2">million tiny ways folks are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.380" end="01:02:15.200" style="s2">navigate the wreckage of all this and</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.730" end="01:02:16.820" style="s2">there&#39;s not gonna be another flag</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.200" end="01:02:20.090" style="s2">planted on a city on a hill</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.820" end="01:02:22.580" style="s2">that has militarization tax resources</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.090" end="01:02:25.250" style="s2">protection sovereign land etc etc so</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.580" end="01:02:28.100" style="s2">we&#39;re integrating into existing systems</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.250" end="01:02:31.310" style="s2">and isolationism is probably has never</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.100" end="01:02:33.260" style="s2">been less possible than it is right now</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.310" end="01:02:35.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a very good point well I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.260" end="01:02:37.280" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna wrap it up here this has</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.720" end="01:02:39.170" style="s2">been a remarkably interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.280" end="01:02:41.030" style="s2">freewheeling conversation a little</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.170" end="01:02:41.930" style="s2">different than I intended but I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.030" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">people are gonna love it</p>
