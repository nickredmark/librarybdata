<p begin="00:01:41.840" end="00:01:48.399" style="s2">last one of the series and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:51.759" style="s2">yeah i the you know original inquiry was</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.399" end="00:01:53.280" style="s2">could we uh address</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.759" end="00:01:54.880" style="s2">questions and so i was happy to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.280" end="00:01:57.520" style="s2">questions of any type and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.880" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">just in clarifying that a bit it seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.520" end="00:02:00.399" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.920" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">the main interesting intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.399" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">questions that happens to be possible</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">here in novel is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:07.360" style="s2">just asking about how do we solve world</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:10.239" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.360" end="00:02:11.440" style="s2">or just asking how do we develop our</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.239" end="00:02:13.840" style="s2">selves for</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.440" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">personal developmental reasons but at</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.840" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">the intersection of the development of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:19.520" style="s2">in relationship to and service of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">going on in the world and what the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.520" end="00:02:23.680" style="s2">needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:25.280" style="s2">so you know there&#39;s one that just asked</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.680" end="00:02:27.280" style="s2">the world question is like well how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.280" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">we solve multi-polar traps let&#39;s take a</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.280" end="00:02:30.319" style="s2">specific example what would a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">economic solution be</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.319" end="00:02:34.160" style="s2">but people ask questions in here more</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:35.840" style="s2">like how do i learn more about the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.160" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">of game theoretic considerations to</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.840" end="00:02:40.080" style="s2">navigate multipolar traps without being</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">corrupted by it internally it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.080" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">development in the presence of world</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">so i think the i think the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">of those questions is really</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:50.160" style="s2">fascinating i like i care about both of</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:51.360" style="s2">those spaces independently but</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.160" end="00:02:52.800" style="s2">particularly the intersection of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.360" end="00:02:54.400" style="s2">and it seems like the stow is uniquely</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.800" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">well suited for that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.400" end="00:02:58.720" style="s2">just clarifying questions about and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.599" end="00:03:00.560" style="s2">personal development means the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.720" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">development of the person not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.560" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">what seems like psychological well-being</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:06.319" style="s2">but cognitive development skill</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.959" style="s2">development network development whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.319" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">uh so yeah i&#39;m i&#39;m interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.959" end="00:03:12.959" style="s2">people&#39;s questions and inquiries in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">space in particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.959" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">right so boom uh start throwing your</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:20.239" style="s2">in the chat right now um you know take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:23.120" style="s2">breather</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.239" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">maybe settle in and then people just</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:26.239" style="s2">bombarding questions already</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.959" style="s2">and just kind of feel into it uh and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.239" end="00:03:30.879" style="s2">i&#39;ll i&#39;ll take someone in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.959" end="00:03:32.400" style="s2">let&#39;s see if i can start off with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.879" end="00:03:35.280" style="s2">question um</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.400" end="00:03:36.000" style="s2">related to the stoa and personal</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.280" end="00:03:37.599" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.000" end="00:03:39.760" style="s2">and my personal development regarding</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.599" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.760" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">i&#39;m finding all the challenges coming up</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:44.480" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">is really serving as like a force</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.480" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">forcing function to practice my stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:51.200" style="s2">and becoming more virtuous which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:54.640" style="s2">quite cool i didn&#39;t really expect that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.200" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">um and one</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.640" end="00:03:58.959" style="s2">challenge or theme that has come up and</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">i feel like it&#39;s going to come up more</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.959" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">and we we talked about it before on</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">whatsapp is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.159" style="s2">unhealthy parasocial relationships and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">how people can</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.159" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">start uh getting fixated on you</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">um because you&#39;re in broadcast mode and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.239" style="s2">whatnot and</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.239" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">culticulture and that kind of hit i</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">put like some people secretly want a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">cult</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:22.880" style="s2">um and they want to project things on</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:26.479" style="s2">you uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.880" end="00:04:28.960" style="s2">and i wonder how you deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.479" end="00:04:30.960" style="s2">because yeah i&#39;ll just say this um this</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.960" end="00:04:33.040" style="s2">session in particular this series</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.960" end="00:04:34.479" style="s2">has the most people reaching out to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.040" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">uh requesting things</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.479" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">uh like oh you should do this you should</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">you should do this because um</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">you know you you&#39;re pretty popular and</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">then your youtube videos at least on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:46.000" style="s2">stove i have more than most people</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">um and so i wonder how you you deal with</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.000" end="00:04:49.600" style="s2">it personally and if you have any advice</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:51.280" style="s2">for me or other people at the stoa who</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.600" end="00:04:52.000" style="s2">are increasingly becoming a more public</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.280" end="00:04:53.199" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.000" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">and want to do good in the world at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.199" end="00:04:57.840" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.520" end="00:05:11.199" style="s2">this might not be obvious to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.080" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">since i&#39;ve done quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.199" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">speaking publicly on podcasts and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">various things but i&#39;ve never liked</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">public speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.840" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">i actually particularly don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.320" end="00:05:30.479" style="s2">attention on me as a person</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:32.560" style="s2">and so i</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.479" end="00:05:34.080" style="s2">just avoided it for a very long time and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.560" end="00:05:37.039" style="s2">tried to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.080" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">work through channels of influence that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.039" end="00:05:41.520" style="s2">were</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:43.759" style="s2">less public and</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.520" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">i was particularly bothered by when</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.759" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">people would focus on me like even this</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">question as opposed to focusing on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">topics that i was interested in</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:55.280" style="s2">and there&#39;s actually a certain point at</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">which i just had to accept that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.280" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">going to happen to a certain degree and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:05.520" style="s2">not be too bothered by it um</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.240" end="00:06:07.120" style="s2">if sharing publicly is useful and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.520" end="00:06:10.000" style="s2">you know both work to encourage people</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.120" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">to focus on the topics rather than</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.000" end="00:06:14.960" style="s2">personas but also not let the aversion</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">to that get in the way of sharing things</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.960" end="00:06:17.759" style="s2">that can be useful</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.479" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">i think if someone is coming from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">other place of having</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:27.360" style="s2">kind of desire for it more than a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:28.240" style="s2">version there&#39;s slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.360" end="00:06:31.280" style="s2">things to</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.240" end="00:06:32.160" style="s2">uh work with i will say if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.280" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2">anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.160" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">is kind of excited to share things and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">be well known for them</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:39.600" style="s2">it&#39;s just less fun than you might think</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.560" end="00:06:42.639" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.600" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">to have lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.639" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">people uh in a position to either</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">have hope attached to you that you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">no ability to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">really do anything about and then other</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">people be able to strawman you that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:58.000" style="s2">can&#39;t address all of those things like</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah i would i wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.000" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">a particularly fun thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.560" style="s2">and the other thing i&#39;d say is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">the degree to which somebody actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.560" end="00:07:11.280" style="s2">cares about</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.440" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">anything right they have some basis of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.240" end="00:07:18.960" style="s2">values and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">um integrity the more incongruency is</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.960" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">painful</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">and so then also the more reflective</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">they are and notice the incongruency the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">more kind of intolerable it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">so peter when you were saying as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">here sharing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:32.720" style="s2">these things you actually feel kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:35.120" style="s2">impulse to</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.720" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">practice and embody the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.120" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">believe more because you&#39;re holding the</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">space for other people to do it</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">uh i think that&#39;s actually one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">cool opportunities</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:47.440" style="s2">i you know there&#39;s this perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">says heal or heal thyself like get your</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.440" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">own straight before helping anyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">else and there&#39;s truth to that</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">but there&#39;s also truth to in the process</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">of helping other people</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a kind of learning that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">in sharing and facilitating and teaching</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:03.919" style="s2">that is different</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:06.160" style="s2">than the learning that happens just on</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.919" end="00:08:07.039" style="s2">the other side of it pedagogically the</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.160" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.039" end="00:08:10.879" style="s2">uh learn to teach model as part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:13.840" style="s2">learning</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.879" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">is is very interesting i&#39;ve noticed a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.840" end="00:08:18.000" style="s2">lot of people who became</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">therapists actually became therapists</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.000" end="00:08:23.440" style="s2">because at least in part as they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:23.440" style="s2">helping other people</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.680" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">develop psychologically they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">gaining continuous like</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">instantiated nuanced insights about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">nature of the psychology and other</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:35.279" style="s2">people and it really helped them in</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:41.519" style="s2">their own reflection and growth</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.279" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.519" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">how do you relate with impression</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:48.320" style="s2">management and um</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:51.040" style="s2">like doing good in the world um</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.320" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">in a broadcast medium uh where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.040" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">there&#39;s an avatar view gets created in</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">how do you relate to that avatar because</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">i know i know you seem very</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">careful about what you say and you want</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">to know your audience</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:07.200" style="s2">in case any kind of information hazard</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">kind of gets unleashed or something like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.200" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious how you relate to your</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">own impression in the spectacle</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.920" end="00:09:22.080" style="s2">in a way obviously that kind of informs</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.320" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">me and other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.080" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">putting themselves out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.880" style="s2">yeah i mean if you have a clear sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:32.560" style="s2">why you&#39;re sharing something publicly</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.880" end="00:09:34.320" style="s2">you have a sense of what the positive</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.560" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">opportunity associated that you care</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.320" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:39.519" style="s2">is um you know there&#39;s kind of a swot</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">there&#39;s a there there&#39;s some thread</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.519" end="00:09:42.240" style="s2">reliability associated with the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.240" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">and you just think through that and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">for instance talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">catastrophic risks because you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:52.320" style="s2">information hazard</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:53.760" style="s2">if people don&#39;t understand the reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.320" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">of catastrophic risk then there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.760" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">enough people who care to work on</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">hopefully solving it so there&#39;s benefit</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">to try to help more people understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">how eminent catastrophic risk</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:07.680" style="s2">possibilities are</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.839" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">and yet if you get so detailed that you</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.680" end="00:10:10.720" style="s2">start saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">let me give you examples of very</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.720" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">specific</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">types of terrorist attacks that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:17.279" style="s2">possible in specific fragilities and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">supply chains</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.279" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">you&#39;re actually helping a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:21.200" style="s2">who don&#39;t understand how to cause</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:22.320" style="s2">problems understand how to cause</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.200" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">problems more</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.320" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">with that research so there&#39;s a direct</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">info hazard so it would have the benefit</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:29.920" style="s2">of motivating some people would</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">also have a risk associated so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.920" end="00:10:36.000" style="s2">definitely responsibility in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">considering those things and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.000" end="00:10:39.920" style="s2">typically like there are some people</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">whose work is as a public intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.920" end="00:10:44.839" style="s2">where their public sharing is the main</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:46.320" style="s2">method of contribution but i think more</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.839" end="00:10:49.360" style="s2">often what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.320" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">effective is that people have projects</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.360" end="00:10:53.200" style="s2">that they&#39;re working on</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">to try to benefit things and the public</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.200" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">sharing is it</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">is adjacent or you know facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">something associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i would think doing this</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">is very useful</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">by itself like it&#39;s not hopefully it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">not totally useless</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:09.760" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of people who i work with</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">right now in projects who i found</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:16.880" style="s2">through these mediums</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">right there was putting some information</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.880" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">out and it served as a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:23.040" style="s2">bat signal or a tractor dynamic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:25.600" style="s2">very useful to projects that have theory</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.040" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">of chains that i really believe in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.600" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">and then to the degree we want to</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:36.480" style="s2">to find and be able to interact with</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:38.399" style="s2">really good mentors and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.480" end="00:13:40.160" style="s2">there&#39;s so many topics that i know are</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.399" end="00:13:41.519" style="s2">really consequential that i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.160" end="00:13:44.480" style="s2">in that i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.519" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">really deep expertise in and one of my</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.480" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">fastest ways to try to get enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">sense that i can navigate it</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">hopefully uh competently</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:56.399" style="s2">is to find experts in the space that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">think are earnest and really care and</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.399" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">particularly find</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">multiple of them that disagree on</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">critical things and so then</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">i&#39;ll reach out to them and really try to</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">uh have them guide me through the basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">understanding of the topic</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:17.440" style="s2">and what they think are the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">truths how they&#39;re forecasting it uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.440" end="00:14:21.040" style="s2">those types of things</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">and then also and why the field is</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.040" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">consequential what they think is</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.560" style="s2">important that everybody&#39;s getting wrong</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.320" style="s2">you know those types of things and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">where people that i think are earnest</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.320" end="00:14:32.480" style="s2">and smart good thinkers who&#39;ve spent 10</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">20 30 40 years working on a topic and</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.480" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">i&#39;m just not going to be able to catch</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">up with that where they disagree</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:40.560" style="s2">and is it because they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">different data</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.560" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">because they&#39;re coming in with different</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:46.079" style="s2">epistemologies because they&#39;re weighting</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">the data differently</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.079" end="00:14:52.079" style="s2">using different models and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">if if i can understand where they agree</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.079" end="00:14:55.680" style="s2">what is seen as common knowledge where</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:57.680" style="s2">they disagree and why</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.680" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">then i start to feel like i&#39;m getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.680" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">some sense of how to navigate it then i</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">want to see what would it take to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.120" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">bring about agreement right bring about</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:05.760" style="s2">consilience</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">so i have like i actively seek out</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">who i think have good expertise in areas</p>

<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">very informed high quality conversations</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">where the people were</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">actually quite well self-educated and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">were thinking about epistemology and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">formal logic</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">and good faith dialogue and then where</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:55.200" style="s2">they actually started to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">limits of pure rationality and starting</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.200" end="00:17:58.400" style="s2">to think about symbol grounding issues</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">so then they started like circling and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.400" end="00:18:04.480" style="s2">getting into different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">other intelligences i i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.480" end="00:18:08.960" style="s2">kind of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:11.840" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.960" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">i think there are some people who like</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.840" end="00:18:15.200" style="s2">we focus on</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:16.960" style="s2">the downside of being a digital native</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.200" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">and growing up in a digital environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.960" end="00:18:19.919" style="s2">where you get</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">false intuition you don&#39;t get an</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.919" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">intuition that is kind of conditioned on</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">physics but on somebody&#39;s manufactured</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.080" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:27.919" style="s2">that&#39;s true and that&#39;s the more</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.080" end="00:18:29.520" style="s2">widespread thing but there&#39;s some subset</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.919" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">of digital natives that got</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.520" end="00:18:32.960" style="s2">kind of very epistemically oriented who</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">are just</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.960" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2"> amazing at online research and</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:38.160" style="s2">specifically the open source</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:40.799" style="s2">intelligence field</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.160" end="00:18:42.880" style="s2">um they&#39;re really exceptional being able</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.799" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.880" end="00:18:46.880" style="s2">scrubbing of large amounts of data and</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:49.919" style="s2">image recognition and things like that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.880" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">and that starts to offer some way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.919" end="00:18:53.280" style="s2">counter the asymmetric info warfares</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:55.760" style="s2">that are out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.280" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">so i find that very interesting seeing</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.760" end="00:19:00.080" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:01.600" style="s2">what aubry tang and friends in taiwan</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.080" end="00:19:03.679" style="s2">are doing with digital democracy</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.600" end="00:19:05.200" style="s2">and how to kind of counteract</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.679" end="00:19:06.559" style="s2">misinformation and do</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">better sensing and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.559" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">governance i think that&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:10.640" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:15.360" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s a number of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.600" style="s2">spaces that</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.360" end="00:19:19.280" style="s2">that i appreciate um and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.600" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">are very different if you take kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.280" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">the um you know ascent</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:32.400" style="s2">space and then you take the like</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">permaculture intersects with psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.400" end="00:19:35.120" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.840" style="s2">um there&#39;s some intersection those are</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.120" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">quite different but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.840" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s some really kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.480" style="s2">significant omissions or flaws in each</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.480" end="00:19:46.000" style="s2">and some gifts the fact that some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">those spaces start having an</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.000" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">intersection is actually promising to me</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.720" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s the kind of meta tribe thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s being explored here which</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">i really like it&#39;s why things like the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">intersection of thinking about macro</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:20:00.400" style="s2">systemic issues and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">and how we personally and as a group</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.400" end="00:20:05.520" style="s2">relate to those is something that i</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">am hopeful for and then the last</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.520" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">question you asked was theories of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:09.520" style="s2">change</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">um yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">that&#39;s like a big thing i&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:20.400" style="s2">and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.559" style="s2">you happen to say that you were looking</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.400" end="00:20:24.320" style="s2">at some people had interesting theories</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.559" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">of change or something new on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.320" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">horizon it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.919" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a that&#39;s a big deal for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:32.480" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.919" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">yeah i mean this this would easily take</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.480" end="00:20:37.440" style="s2">several sessions to try to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:38.880" style="s2">say when we think of a theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.440" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">being good does it mean that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.880" end="00:20:42.320" style="s2">mapped the problem space well enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.640" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">that we can define a theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.320" end="00:20:45.360" style="s2">that is both necessary and sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:46.799" style="s2">and be able to do some proof of</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.360" end="00:20:47.919" style="s2">sufficiency</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.799" end="00:20:50.400" style="s2">is that what we mean by interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.919" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">theory of change that&#39;s a very high bar</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.400" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">and or does it mean that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:55.039" style="s2">something that from a forward</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:56.400" style="s2">engineering that&#39;s kind of from a</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.039" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">reverse engineering point of view or</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.400" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">from a forward engineering point of view</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.760" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">a theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:02.480" style="s2">acts on a certain level of sense making</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">an agency in a way that both</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.480" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">increases sense making an agency so even</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">though it&#39;s not clear that it converges</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">towards sufficiency it&#39;s increasing its</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">in a direction that could converge and</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">then maybe there&#39;s a theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">that by itself is not anywhere close to</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:18.880" style="s2">sufficient but it&#39;s really meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:20.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.880" end="00:21:22.240" style="s2">in connection with a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.799" end="00:21:23.679" style="s2">things could start to map towards</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.240" end="00:21:25.360" style="s2">sufficient something working on</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.679" end="00:21:26.960" style="s2">governance something working on markets</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.360" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">something working on culture</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.960" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">you know et cetera um</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.960" end="00:21:37.679" style="s2">so for i&#39;ll give you just a random</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:40.880" style="s2">smattering of theories of change that i</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.679" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">think are at least well informed that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.880" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">friends of mine and adjacent spaces are</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">working on</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">that are not like commonly talked about</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.280" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">so if you look at the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:22:00.080" style="s2">has shifted recently</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">to have more winner take all orientation</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.080" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">than it previously had</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">and small businesses closed during covid</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.480" style="s2">lots of unemployment happens but the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">value of amazon and tesla and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.480" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">top</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:15.520" style="s2">stock companies double and um</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">those types of things and then you look</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:20.400" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:22.559" style="s2">the fact that you know something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.400" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">two thousand to five thousand families</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.559" end="00:22:27.520" style="s2">own most of the world&#39;s wealth</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:28.000" style="s2">and even though they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.520" end="00:22:29.280" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.000" end="00:22:30.880" style="s2">all the wealth when you factor just</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.280" end="00:22:32.159" style="s2">people owning their houses times how</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.880" end="00:22:34.080" style="s2">many people there are on land</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">those people don&#39;t control the financial</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.080" end="00:22:38.480" style="s2">industry um or the</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:39.360" style="s2">the underlying um you know financial</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.480" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">markets</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">so disproportionately to just ownership</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">of capital is the ownership</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:47.840" style="s2">of the change in underlying market</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.840" end="00:22:52.400" style="s2">so when you look at that and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.640" end="00:22:54.320" style="s2">the winner takes all type dynamics that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.400" end="00:22:56.000" style="s2">continue that wealth concentration and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.320" end="00:22:57.840" style="s2">then you combine that with</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.840" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">make very fast money on money returns</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:05.360" style="s2">you combine that with the fact that the</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:17.120" style="s2">are basically as big</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.400" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">as nation-state militaries and those are</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:23.679" style="s2">families uh so basically nation state</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">level military capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.679" end="00:23:28.159" style="s2">accessible for hire and then you take</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.159" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">people that they have to have a lecture</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">in again and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:34.640" style="s2">and yet they can affect campaigns and</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.159" style="s2">elections across countries they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.640" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">have land they have to protect but they</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.159" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">can influence</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">uh land deals there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:43.840" style="s2">that think of this as the new emerging</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.480" style="s2">feudalism the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.840" end="00:23:47.039" style="s2">kind of feudalism where families start</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.480" end="00:23:51.039" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.039" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">more dominant actors than nation states</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:55.120" style="s2">and so the theory of change being how to</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:57.039" style="s2">maximally meet the needs of those</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.120" end="00:23:57.919" style="s2">families in a way that also influences</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.039" end="00:24:00.559" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.919" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">that what would cause major catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.559" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">risk is actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">decrease in security for them</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">uh like that&#39;s that is a totally valid</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.640" style="s2">and interesting</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">assessment and theory of change</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.640" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">and it couldn&#39;t be more different than</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:20.559" style="s2">something like bjorkman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:22.159" style="s2">um bildung kind of model that is much</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.559" end="00:24:25.279" style="s2">more decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">bottom-up cultural um trying to decrease</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.279" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">that wealth concentration so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">one side says the wealth concentration</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">is it&#39;s pretty inexorable so really try</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">to influence the top of the power law</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">distribution the other side says can we</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:37.919" style="s2">do a rolling debt jubilee or something</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">to change that wealth concentration</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.919" end="00:24:42.240" style="s2">reboot a new financial system</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">those are both interesting and then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.240" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">question is like</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:46.559" style="s2">do you run a portfolio of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.559" style="s2">strategies is there a way that those can</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.559" end="00:24:49.919" style="s2">have synergies with each other</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.559" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">and then when you start to look at</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.919" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">strategies that emphasize something like</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:57.919" style="s2">versus military versus culture versus</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">state and legislation are there</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.919" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">synergies between those because nobody</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">can do all that work so they end up</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">emphasizing a particular subset of</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:06.960" style="s2">actuators</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">and yet multiple actuators if they were</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.960" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">in the right synergy become more</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:13.120" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:15.279" style="s2">so i&#39;m interested in a network of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.120" end="00:25:17.919" style="s2">solutions that maps to sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.279" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">not a solution that maps to sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.919" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">and so i&#39;m interested</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">in people that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">have really</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">good faith interactions with each other</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">to increase the coordination across</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">different earnest theory of changes</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">you could be anything thank you thank</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:46.400" style="s2">you so much</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">um all right so next up</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.400" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">we&#39;ll do ryan you have something about</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">design principles</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">if you can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:58.960" style="s2">oop how do i start video there it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">hey daniel thanks this has been really</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:06.000" style="s2">fun um</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.400" style="s2">so i had a couple of questions feel free</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.000" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.400" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">answer one none or any of them um</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:14.480" style="s2">and they kind of piggyback off of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.880" end="00:26:15.919" style="s2">we&#39;re just talking about about good</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.480" end="00:26:18.159" style="s2">faith</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.919" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">so i&#39;ll just read them out what are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.159" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">design principles that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.679" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">have found most useful when engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.440" style="s2">collective problem solving</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:26.559" style="s2">are there criteria that you rely upon to</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.440" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">promote or create</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.559" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">a pro-social environment within which</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">a group of problem solvers are more</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:35.279" style="s2">likely to encounter meaningfully useful</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.279" end="00:26:40.400" style="s2">questions potential solutions and</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:42.400" style="s2">generate working models</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.400" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">have you found that there is a quote</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.400" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">dunbar&#39;s number of sorts</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.919" style="s2">for agents involved in collective design</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:48.559" style="s2">and lastly how do you think about</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.919" end="00:26:50.880" style="s2">leveraging</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.559" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">embodiment techniques or ritual to</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.880" end="00:26:56.000" style="s2">invoke such a container</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">thanks so much yeah this great</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.000" end="00:27:01.440" style="s2">question uh and if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.360" style="s2">address all the parts of it come back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:05.279" style="s2">them because they&#39;re all good</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.360" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">so when you talk about design principles</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.279" end="00:27:09.679" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">the object side which is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:14.000" style="s2">design considerations for understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">the problem space in a good solution</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:17.919" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">interpersonal side of how do you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.919" end="00:27:21.919" style="s2">people to coordinate well to engage in</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">collective</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.919" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">problem solving and design and i heard</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">you more asking the second one</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:31.600" style="s2">um but probably both so i&#39;ll see if i</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:34.960" style="s2">can address them both a bit</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:37.120" style="s2">if if you haven&#39;t had it yet um</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.960" end="00:27:38.559" style="s2">having forrest on probably forrest and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.120" end="00:27:41.200" style="s2">zach together to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:42.720" style="s2">egp and agp which is something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.200" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">forrest spent the last few years working</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.720" end="00:27:48.799" style="s2">on as a design methodology for doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:51.919" style="s2">um complex uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.799" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">problem assessment and design criteria</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.919" end="00:27:55.600" style="s2">to do this thing he calls transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:27:57.360" style="s2">design basically</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.600" end="00:27:59.520" style="s2">how do you do design in the complex</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">rather than the complicated domain in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.520" end="00:28:03.360" style="s2">way that</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">maximally anticipates and internalizes</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.360" end="00:28:07.039" style="s2">externalities and also has the right</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:09.039" style="s2">design iteration process to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.039" end="00:28:11.200" style="s2">internalize externalities and additional</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.039" end="00:28:13.360" style="s2">considerations that weren&#39;t forecasted</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.200" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s both an upfront and an iterative</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.360" end="00:28:18.559" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:20.320" style="s2">and uh i would say it is the best</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.559" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">process that i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.320" end="00:28:24.000" style="s2">for how to understand the problem well</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:26.000" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.000" end="00:28:29.279" style="s2">that you get the design constraints to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.000" end="00:28:29.279" style="s2">think through a solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">um and that&#39;s the egp part of it the</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">ephemeral group process</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll just briefly say and</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:42.080" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to address it at all</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:44.720" style="s2">it starts with purely questions</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.080" end="00:28:46.640" style="s2">um and this is actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.720" end="00:28:47.600" style="s2">valuable insight and just for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.640" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.600" end="00:28:54.080" style="s2">factor in your own design thinking so</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:55.440" style="s2">we&#39;re before saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.080" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">we&#39;re building a bridge here now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.440" end="00:28:58.480" style="s2">going to do a design shop on how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">build a bridge the bridge is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.480" end="00:29:01.360" style="s2">solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">but the bridge might also cause some</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.360" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">other problems which is why if we have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:05.440" style="s2">proposition to make the bridge or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">make the bridge you&#39;re going to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.440" end="00:29:10.960" style="s2">half of people on either side right</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">very rarely do we have a proposition in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.960" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">in</p>

<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">which means that most any proposition</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.960" end="00:29:22.159" style="s2">that goes through</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:23.760" style="s2">about half of the people really think</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.159" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">it&#39;s a dreadful idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.760" end="00:29:29.440" style="s2">and so that process itself can&#39;t not</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">polarize a population</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.440" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">and there was i don&#39;t remember who it</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:33.919" style="s2">was but there was some founding father</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">that made a statement around</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.919" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">uh voting as the death of democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">most of us think about voting as</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:43.279" style="s2">democracy and it&#39;s like no no the town</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:46.399" style="s2">hall where you talk</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.279" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">is democracy democracy the democratizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.399" end="00:29:49.840" style="s2">the process of input into figuring</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:51.120" style="s2">something out is what democracy means</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.840" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">voting is what you do</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.120" end="00:29:54.960" style="s2">to sublimate warfare when you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.960" end="00:29:58.640" style="s2">um but the goal in the town hall is can</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:00.720" style="s2">we all</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.640" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">share our problem assessments the things</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:05.200" style="s2">that we value the criteria</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">enough and then be able to dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.200" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">about this solution and not just yes no</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">on that solution but that solution is</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:11.360" style="s2">pretty good for these things but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">caused a problem here what if we do this</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.360" end="00:30:14.559" style="s2">right until you come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:14.960" style="s2">where everyone&#39;s like going ahead with</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.559" end="00:30:17.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.960" end="00:30:19.039" style="s2">is better than the other options right</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.279" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">and even if i have some compromise the</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.039" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">compromise is better than the warfare</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">associated with the non-compromise</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:26.799" style="s2">but if we can&#39;t get that we&#39;re like no</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2"> it just no on that we and so we go</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.799" end="00:30:31.360" style="s2">to a vote rather than bullets</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">then the population will start to</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.360" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">polarize along those voting lines</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:37.760" style="s2">increasingly so and then you start</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">getting a situation where whatever</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.760" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">somebody does then in the next term</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:42.960" style="s2">the other people are trying to undo and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:45.440" style="s2">most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.960" end="00:30:46.880" style="s2">energy goes into internal friction and</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.440" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">you just can&#39;t do when all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.880" end="00:30:51.919" style="s2">energy goes into internal friction</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.640" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">right and this</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.919" end="00:30:58.159" style="s2">is why the combination of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">binary two-party system or a yes no on a</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.159" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">proposition system where half of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">people will dislike anything</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:07.200" style="s2">combined with a mostly voting and no no</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:11.039" style="s2">real town hall type engagement</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.200" end="00:31:13.519" style="s2">combined with term limits</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.039" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">makes long-term planning almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.519" end="00:31:16.480" style="s2">perfectly impossible</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.840" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">um because whatever you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:21.360" style="s2">implement</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">if it doesn&#39;t create its returns within</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.360" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">the four years you&#39;re not even going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">try</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.279" style="s2">and you know whatever you do will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:30.320" style="s2">undone after those four years and</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.279" end="00:31:31.679" style="s2">you know so um so that&#39;s obviously not</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.320" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">functional and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:36.000" style="s2">and in the business sector it&#39;s often an</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:37.760" style="s2">even tighter it&#39;s a quarterly time scale</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.000" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">um depending upon the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.760" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">business and if it&#39;s private or public</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:42.399" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">so obviously before we have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.559" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">proposition that we vote on</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:51.679" style="s2">we should have some process to say what</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">would a good proposition be</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.679" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">did we even have a process to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">what is everything that people care</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">about why</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:59.760" style="s2">some people are saying no to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:01.760" style="s2">proposition other people saying yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.760" end="00:32:03.279" style="s2">so that we can even do a design process</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.760" end="00:32:04.799" style="s2">to come up with a good proposition the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.279" end="00:32:06.960" style="s2">fact that</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.799" end="00:32:08.799" style="s2">we go straight to voting on propositions</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.960" end="00:32:10.799" style="s2">that somebody makes up with very partial</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.799" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">insights and usually vested interest</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.799" end="00:32:16.080" style="s2">usually special interest and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">even have a formalized process for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.080" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">proposition development like that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:25.279" style="s2">obviously inadequate</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:26.960" style="s2">um and so maybe the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.279" end="00:32:28.640" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to vote yes or no on</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.960" end="00:32:30.320" style="s2">the bridge proposal it&#39;s like well why</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.640" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">does anybody want to make a bridge</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.320" end="00:32:32.960" style="s2">and it might just be a construction</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:34.080" style="s2">company wants to make one because</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.960" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">they&#39;re going to get the contract and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:36.320" style="s2">it&#39;s purely</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">vested interest that just sucks for</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.320" end="00:32:38.480" style="s2">everybody well that&#39;s kind of worth</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:41.600" style="s2">knowing right</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.480" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">but if there&#39;s a real reason that these</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.600" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2">two areas are separated enough that it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:45.840" style="s2">takes</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">two hours for people to commute where it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.840" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">could take 15 minutes and there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">economic situation where it really makes</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:52.159" style="s2">a difference and</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">so then you say okay the underlying need</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.159" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">has to do with a particular set of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">economic needs that are associated with</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.919" style="s2">transportation</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">it might be that a bridge is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.919" end="00:33:02.640" style="s2">go it might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">that because of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.640" end="00:33:06.480" style="s2">environmental or aesthetic or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:08.320" style="s2">effects that that bridge would have</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.480" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">that a ferry is a way to go it might be</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.320" end="00:33:11.760" style="s2">a bridge somewhere else is it might also</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">be that developing the local economies</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.760" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">on each side where the people don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">to commute is a way to go there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">of other options</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:20.320" style="s2">once you start to understand what are we</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:22.240" style="s2">trying to benefit and then what are the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.320" end="00:33:24.080" style="s2">adjacent associated things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.240" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">harmed by a particular solution</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.080" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">what is this what is the space of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.640" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">that we care about</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">so you have to do some deeper kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">questioning before you move to</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:37.679" style="s2">proposal process and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:39.600" style="s2">so one of the things that egp does is</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:43.039" style="s2">get people to really generate the</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.600" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">map of relevant things that become the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.039" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">basis for design constraints so then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">can do a</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:49.679" style="s2">design by constraint kind of methodology</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:51.679" style="s2">and say what is the best synergistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.679" end="00:33:53.039" style="s2">satisfier we can find</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.679" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">and then you have an iterative process</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.039" end="00:33:57.360" style="s2">on that one of the other things that</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">happens though as far as social cohesion</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.360" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">is people don&#39;t polarize on other</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:02.159" style="s2">people&#39;s questions</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:06.000" style="s2">in the same way they polarize on other</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.159" end="00:34:07.600" style="s2">people&#39;s statements and propositions</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.000" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">and so if i make a statement that says</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.600" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">we should do this someone can instantly</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">have a negative reaction</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">but if someone says you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">i question what some of the negative</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:19.359" style="s2">environmental impacts of a bridge might</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.040" end="00:34:21.359" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.359" end="00:34:23.359" style="s2">everyone can be like that&#39;s a fair</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.359" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">question you know i&#39;m a fisherman i like</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.359" end="00:34:25.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">fish i don&#39;t want to that up too</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.280" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">bad or whatever it is right</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">um and so one of the interesting things</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">is that the</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">i can tell you some things that seem</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.960" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">do a thing because it just is so much</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:52.240" style="s2"> easier</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">and um and it&#39;s important to actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.240" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">come to understand why the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">has been selected for has been selected</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:37:00.640" style="s2">to not just have naive ideas about the</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.640" end="00:37:04.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s good trying to implement some of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">the naive ideas and really try to be</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.320" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">accountable for the output and watch</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">them fail to then come to understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:10.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:14.880" style="s2">specifically one of the things i found</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.359" end="00:37:17.520" style="s2">so interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.880" end="00:37:19.040" style="s2">one of the things that really messes up</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.520" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">deep collaboration good faith</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.040" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">collaboration is optionality</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">um if i&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">poor people who all can&#39;t afford to buy</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.320" style="s2">their own house</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">and they&#39;re all really struggling and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.320" end="00:37:35.599" style="s2">they decide to build an intentional</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:36.000" style="s2">community together where the way they do</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.599" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">a land</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.000" end="00:37:39.359" style="s2">co-op actually allows them to someday</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.160" end="00:37:42.800" style="s2">own something</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.359" end="00:37:45.119" style="s2">and gives them more s like foundational</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.800" end="00:37:46.800" style="s2">maslow&#39;s hierarchy security</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.119" end="00:37:48.800" style="s2">those people will put up with a decent</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.800" end="00:37:50.400" style="s2">bit of difficulty from each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.800" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">and in working with each other to make</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.400" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">the thing work because they have a real</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">need that needs met that creates binding</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:57.760" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">that overcomes the cleaving energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.760" end="00:38:00.640" style="s2">if i&#39;m trying to do something with</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.400" style="s2">people that have already been somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.640" end="00:38:04.240" style="s2">successful in the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.400" end="00:38:06.000" style="s2">who have the ability to do something at</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.240" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">larger scale all of whom</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.000" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">don&#39;t need the thing to work because</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:10.800" style="s2">they got enough money they can just go</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.640" end="00:38:13.440" style="s2">somewhere else if it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.800" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">the privilege and optionality that that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.440" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">creates</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">makes one willing to put up with less</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:20.960" style="s2">difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">um most of the time so then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.960" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">say okay well how do i bind myself</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">to so um</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.800" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">if i got a bunch of people who&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.160" end="00:38:33.280" style="s2">been ceos or could be ceos</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:34.240" style="s2">and they can basically be mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.280" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">control of</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.240" end="00:38:37.920" style="s2">and they&#39;re used to being effective at</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.520" style="s2">being in control of</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.920" end="00:38:40.960" style="s2">they and they can recognize that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.520" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">an upper bound to what they can do on</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.960" end="00:38:44.079" style="s2">their own but it&#39;s a pretty good upper</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">bound</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.079" end="00:38:47.359" style="s2">and if they come into relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">each other they won&#39;t have the same</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.359" end="00:38:50.640" style="s2">control of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">and they optimized to be good at that</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.640" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">for a reason right they psychologically</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:54.960" style="s2">were oriented to be good at that and</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.960" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">and now they&#39;re going to have other</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">people that have a very deep say in how</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">the things happen</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:03.359" style="s2">and um and they&#39;re just as invested but</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:04.800" style="s2">without as much of a sense of full</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.359" end="00:39:06.720" style="s2">agency and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.800" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s difficult so i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.720" end="00:39:09.520" style="s2">found people trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">intentional communities or</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.520" end="00:39:15.119" style="s2">collaboratives or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">um the people that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.119" end="00:39:21.040" style="s2">have what seem like</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:22.079" style="s2">higher level capacities to affect change</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.040" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">in the world because of what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">already done</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">are some of the people that have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">hardest time actually making</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">meaningful sacrifices because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">feel like they have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:38.960" style="s2">um so then</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">someone has to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.960" end="00:39:42.320" style="s2">something that motivates them more than</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:46.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.320" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">seeming comfort of their own life</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.640" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s a nice idea and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:51.760" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:59.520" style="s2">this is yeah i know you guys had pat</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.359" end="00:40:02.000" style="s2">ryan on before he probably talked about</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.520" end="00:40:03.760" style="s2">um blackmail as a currency of</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.040" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">knowledge with the people you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:12.560" style="s2">to coordinate with where if that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:14.480" style="s2">knowledge was widely shared you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.560" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">lose some of the ability to do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.480" end="00:40:17.599" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to corner a market</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.000" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">know do a military attack whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">where you actually need</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">some element of being able to control</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">the information</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">but you&#39;re like the the challenge is if</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:32.319" style="s2">i want to implement something at some</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.359" style="s2">scale i have to share some information</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.319" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">with some people because i can&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.359" end="00:40:36.640" style="s2">whole thing myself</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">but if i share information with them</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.640" end="00:40:40.400" style="s2">that and they defect and share that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:42.319" style="s2">information with the public the police</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.400" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">the competitor the whoever it is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.319" end="00:40:45.680" style="s2">totally up what i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">somewhere between i get put on a bayonet</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.680" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">or in jail or</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">just become a pariah um or lose the</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.000" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">market opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:56.000" style="s2">how do i share the information to allow</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">the coordination</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.000" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">and protect against defection and in a</p>

<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:04.680" style="s2">it&#39;s you know you take an oath you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.920" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">a commander you violate the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:08.079" style="s2">confidentiality or the classification</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">and you get thrown in prison</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.079" end="00:41:12.319" style="s2">right you there&#39;s a military prison all</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:14.960" style="s2">that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.319" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">in rule of law and generally in contract</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:17.760" style="s2">law you sign a contract you can get</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">taken to the court the court will</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.760" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">enforce it</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">if we&#39;re in a gang and this is the mob</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:24.400" style="s2">and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:25.920" style="s2">snitch on somebody you&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.400" end="00:41:29.359" style="s2">wind up floating in a river</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.920" end="00:41:31.440" style="s2">right but if we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:32.960" style="s2">inter-elite coordination where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.440" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">have the people just wind up in a river</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.960" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">and you also can&#39;t use</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:38.000" style="s2">rule of law because there is no rule of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:41.200" style="s2">law for the thing that is happening</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.000" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">how do you prevent defection and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.200" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">the idea that having some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">mutually assured destruction on each</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:49.599" style="s2">in the in a space that has power which</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">would be the public sphere which</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.599" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">you know would be something like</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:55.920" style="s2">blackmail uh that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.839" style="s2">that that can facilitate coordination</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not facilitating trust right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:00.839" style="s2">not facilitating coherence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.839" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">anti-decoherence right or anti-defection</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:08.000" style="s2">but that fundamentally means that it is</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.720" style="s2">like the culture is</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.000" end="00:42:11.839" style="s2">intrinsically right the culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.720" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.839" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">is not a trust based but a maximally</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:18.640" style="s2">guard against non-trust-based</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:20.319" style="s2">situation so then you have this question</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.640" end="00:42:22.000" style="s2">to say if we don&#39;t have a place where</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">rule of law is the thing that we get to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.000" end="00:42:26.480" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">and we want to create real trust that</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.480" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">binds people</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:32.880" style="s2">to to each other and to a mission</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:36.000" style="s2">where they don&#39;t defect under duress</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.880" end="00:42:37.839" style="s2">where that would be consequential</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.000" end="00:42:40.079" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want to do it through some</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.839" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">form of punishment</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.079" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">but what do you do it what creates the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.000" style="s2">binding energy that prevents defection</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:47.920" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.000" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">dress and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.920" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">you know knight hoods had a model for</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">this and of course they sometimes would</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.720" style="s2">kill someone for defecting so it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">without the stick side</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.720" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">but the sacred oath where someone</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">actually had</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.200" style="s2">a sense of what they were willing to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">give their life for and that they were</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.200" end="00:43:03.760" style="s2">actually willing to give their life that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:04.640" style="s2">there was a transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.760" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.640" end="00:43:09.359" style="s2">bigger than their life and then they</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">could see that these other people</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.359" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">authentically took the same oath and so</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:16.880" style="s2">that there was something that they they</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:18.480" style="s2">couldn&#39;t defect on each other without</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.880" end="00:43:20.480" style="s2">defecting on what matters more to them</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.480" end="00:43:23.760" style="s2">in their own life</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.480" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">um and so they have a binding with each</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.760" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">that is actually mediated through</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">whatever the transcendental values are</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.079" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">i have some experience of that working</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:40.160" style="s2">and i hope to have more experience of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.760" end="00:43:43.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.160" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">working uh as time goes on</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.200" end="00:43:46.960" style="s2">um no i don&#39;t think it&#39;s just enough for</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.119" style="s2">everybody to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.960" end="00:43:50.880" style="s2">uh ayahuasca together and have some like</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.119" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">nice experience that</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.880" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">that feels very deep because the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.480" end="00:43:56.000" style="s2">question is how does it hold later under</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:59.359" style="s2">duress</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.000" end="00:44:01.200" style="s2">um but you know when you study the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.359" end="00:44:02.560" style="s2">masons and you study the templar and you</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.200" end="00:44:04.400" style="s2">study those types of</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.560" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">traditions you&#39;re actually studying a</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.400" end="00:44:08.720" style="s2">set of social technologies that was</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:11.680" style="s2">developed very much to do that thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.720" end="00:44:13.040" style="s2">and i would say most the people that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.680" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">working on how to benefit the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.040" end="00:44:16.720" style="s2">right now are not</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:18.720" style="s2">studying those technologies and what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.720" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">modern applications would be as much as</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.720" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">is useful</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:26.800" style="s2">and i would say do think about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">people&#39;s optionality affects it</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.800" end="00:44:31.599" style="s2">that&#39;s an important thing um</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.040" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things i can say having</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">a culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">inside of a group of collaboration where</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.319" end="00:44:43.359" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:45.200" style="s2">takes more of the responsibility for the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.359" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">problems on themselves and gives more of</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.200" end="00:44:48.640" style="s2">the credit to each other helps a lot</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">like if that&#39;s a cultural value that</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.640" end="00:44:52.640" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:54.800" style="s2">does so rather than have the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.640" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">status competition of your you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.800" end="00:44:57.760" style="s2">hey you copied my thing or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:44:59.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.760" end="00:45:00.960" style="s2">i want to actually whenever i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.760" end="00:45:03.119" style="s2">and i&#39;m saying something i learned from</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.960" end="00:45:05.760" style="s2">you if i can credit you</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.119" end="00:45:07.200" style="s2">and i can help i can help whatever your</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.760" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">motivators are where you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:10.240" style="s2">experience the things you&#39;re motivated</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">by working better working with me than</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.240" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">um but where that is symmetric</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.599" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">right symmetrically that&#39;s held as a</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">value and maybe even a vowel</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:24.400" style="s2">i find those things are quite helpful i</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:26.000" style="s2">also find not setting them up as vowels</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.400" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">up front and just seeing what do people</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.000" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">naturally come in with</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">what is the disposition that they hold</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:32.960" style="s2">because if they don&#39;t already have that</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:33.599" style="s2">disposition they might not even be able</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.960" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.599" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">or want to be bound to it by some</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:39.839" style="s2">agreement</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:41.359" style="s2">so to some degree simply observing where</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.839" end="00:45:42.400" style="s2">people are coming from first and not</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.359" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">moving too fast</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.400" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">is helpful we could we could talk a long</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">time on this one</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">ryan did you have a follow-up i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.560" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">want to take any more of your time that</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:57.520" style="s2">was just</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">really really fun yeah that was that was</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.520" end="00:46:00.079" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.560" style="s2">uh maybe if you could just talk to</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.079" end="00:46:06.480" style="s2">embodiment principles or techniques</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.560" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">uh not ayahuasca ceremonies that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.480" end="00:46:15.839" style="s2">uh help with group coherence</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:24.240" style="s2">i&#39;ll share something uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.800" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">that forest could expand on again</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.240" end="00:46:28.880" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if people here have how</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:30.319" style="s2">many have</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.880" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">basic familiarity with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.319" end="00:46:34.400" style="s2">concepts in the eminent metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:36.160" style="s2">the domain of the eminent the omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.400" end="00:46:38.560" style="s2">and the transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.160" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">uh i won&#39;t belabor this long as i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:43.280" style="s2">have the time to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:46.480" style="s2">but if you do have the familiarity</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.280" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">there are types of bonding and coherence</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">in each of those domains</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:51.760" style="s2">and one of the things i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:53.599" style="s2">that it requires bonding in each of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.760" end="00:46:55.520" style="s2">domains so when you say embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.599" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">you&#39;re probably mostly talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.520" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">coherence in the eminent domain</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:04.640" style="s2">and this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:08.560" style="s2">this is everything from</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.640" end="00:47:11.119" style="s2">um a tribal practice of dancing together</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.560" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">uh in a drum circle around the fire</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.119" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">before making</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">before tribal council and making a</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:18.400" style="s2">decision there&#39;s something very profound</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:19.280" style="s2">that happens in that kind of ritual</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.400" end="00:47:23.359" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.280" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">in the drummers are both doing their own</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.359" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">and being in sync with each other right</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.839" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">they&#39;re all kind of following a base</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">but they&#39;re also doing their own thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:33.040" style="s2">so there&#39;s a balance of agency and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">communion if they start doing their own</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.040" end="00:47:35.280" style="s2">thing that is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:36.240" style="s2">out of beat it&#39;ll sound really shitty</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.280" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">and everyone would be like what are you</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.240" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">but for them to kind of improv so</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">there&#39;s a how do you find individuality</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">in a way that also has harmony and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">dancers similarly are all doing their</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">own thing</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">but to a similar beat right so there is</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">but maybe some are on the half step and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:55.280" style="s2">some are on the double step and the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.880" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">so there is a way that there is harmony</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.280" end="00:47:58.640" style="s2">between everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:00.800" style="s2">with with individual expression and that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.640" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">that can create an embodied experience</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.800" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">of like oh we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:07.520" style="s2">we have some deeper than semantic level</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:09.359" style="s2">of connectedness and familiarity with</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.520" end="00:48:10.559" style="s2">each other then we go into the tribal</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.359" end="00:48:11.920" style="s2">council we&#39;re going to talk through</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.559" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">something and we&#39;re bringing in</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.920" end="00:48:16.720" style="s2">a sense of positive bonding with each</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">other plus coherence with each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.720" end="00:48:19.359" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">coherence and the eminent whereas</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.359" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">coherence in the omniscient</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:24.400" style="s2">in the cognitive would be like logical</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">congruence are we factoring the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.400" end="00:48:27.280" style="s2">data do we have the same waiting</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">algorithms on it are we using the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.280" end="00:48:33.200" style="s2">propositional logic</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.200" end="00:48:37.119" style="s2">eminent coherence can also be doing barn</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">raising together</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.119" end="00:48:40.319" style="s2">which also means build a burning man</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">camp together</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.319" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">right the barn raising or the burning</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">man camp is we&#39;re experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">actually working together and you get</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">experience like</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t actually really work</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:52.880" style="s2">um and who claims a lot of work and</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:54.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t who really does</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.880" end="00:48:56.400" style="s2">how does that kind of fix itself where</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.640" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">there is a sense of like oh we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.400" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">in this together working supporting each</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:00.880" style="s2">other making the thing happen a real</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.440" style="s2">thing happened</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.880" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a experience of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.440" end="00:49:06.640" style="s2">kind of coherence that happens from</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:07.200" style="s2">building some real together that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.640" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.200" end="00:49:12.480" style="s2">get from any level of</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">um psycho-emotional bonding group</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.480" end="00:49:16.319" style="s2">therapy or</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:18.319" style="s2">cognitive work right it&#39;s the eminent</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.319" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">domain is a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.319" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">um so i would say</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:30.960" style="s2">looking at some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:32.880" style="s2">uh can we actually work together can we</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.960" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">find coherence and work together and can</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.880" end="00:49:36.160" style="s2">we sync together</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">in some kind of fundamental and embodied</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.160" end="00:49:39.760" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:41.599" style="s2">then can we find logical congruence are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.760" end="00:49:44.880" style="s2">we running similar</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.599" end="00:49:46.880" style="s2">axioms and epistemics and in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.880" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">transcendental way are we oriented to</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.880" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">similar values</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">do we have a similar kind of set of</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">transcendental values that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">oriented towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">that there need to be some practices in</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">all three of those areas</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:00.800" style="s2">for it to really be effective</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.359" style="s2">all right beautiful um</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:09.119" style="s2">and we actually do have forests coming</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.359" end="00:50:10.880" style="s2">in tomorrow maybe i&#39;ll just plug that</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.119" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">right now while it&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.880" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">at um 3 p.m eastern time margaret and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">myself are going to have a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">with him on the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">ephemeral group process so that&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">cool and also that</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">blackmail guy pat ryan uh he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">be in</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.440" style="s2">this friday for another session of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:31.200" style="s2">dark stoa so check that out</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.440" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">um a question uh from kerry above</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.200" end="00:50:34.559" style="s2">on the ethics of a vegan diet uh if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:36.000" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.839" style="s2">meet yourself and ask your question i</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:40.559" style="s2">copied and pasted right here in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">chats</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.559" end="00:50:46.640" style="s2">hey danielle thank you um</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">so i heard you speak uh in an interview</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.640" end="00:50:52.079" style="s2">i think it was about six years ago</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">on the ethics of a vegan diet um</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.079" end="00:50:57.119" style="s2">i&#39;m a nutritionist and so i&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:51:00.720" style="s2">about food quite extensively for</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.119" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">20 years or so um so</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.720" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting to me because diet</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:04.800" style="s2">seems to be at the intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">personal choice</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.800" end="00:51:09.520" style="s2">and personal impact and community global</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:12.559" style="s2">and civilizational impact</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.520" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">uh with 2.6 million years of human</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.559" end="00:51:16.800" style="s2">species eating meat it seems like we</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:18.960" style="s2">carry a biological imperative to</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.800" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">some amount of animal for our best</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.960" end="00:51:22.960" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">um and i heard you speak something about</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">acts thinking about it really carefully</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.079" end="00:51:30.800" style="s2">and educating oneself</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:33.920" style="s2">on how to eat a vegan diet well and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.800" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">algaes and different things but i see</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.920" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">accessing these things is somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:42.800" style="s2">challenging not practical for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:44.440" style="s2">potentially even privileged um so how</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.800" end="00:51:46.720" style="s2">can we move out of the nightmare of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.440" end="00:51:47.359" style="s2">commodification of animals but still</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.720" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">meet our</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.359" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">omnivorous needs</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.559" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">this this is one of the trickier topics</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:03.440" style="s2">um i kind of wish</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.800" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t bring it up because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.440" end="00:52:06.000" style="s2">very hard</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">to feel like we can do any justice to it</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.000" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">in a short amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:14.160" style="s2">because the science itself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:16.839" style="s2">very complex in the formal sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.160" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">word complex</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.839" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">meaning what metrics do i pick to</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">measure health</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.559" style="s2">and which of those are differentially</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">benefited more by different</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.559" end="00:52:28.800" style="s2">diets and did i control properly did i</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:30.839" style="s2">control for other environmental factors</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.800" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">and con commitment factors and genetics</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.839" end="00:52:34.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">and so you&#39;ll have a china study and</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.640" end="00:52:37.760" style="s2">then you&#39;ll have a refute to china study</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:38.960" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll have an atkins study and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.760" end="00:52:42.720" style="s2">then you&#39;ll have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.960" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">and while i have seen some comparative</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.720" end="00:52:45.680" style="s2">nutritionists</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.599" end="00:52:46.720" style="s2">try to look across those data sets and</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.680" end="00:52:48.319" style="s2">compare them well</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.720" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">i have not seen epistemics that i</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.319" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">consider adequate</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:53.599" style="s2">to the problem space yet</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.520" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">so when we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.359" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">ethics obviously there&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">what is actually possible and what is</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">actually true</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:09.280" style="s2">objectively that is going to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">of that if if people really can be fully</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.280" end="00:53:12.720" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">without eating animal products or they</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.720" end="00:53:14.960" style="s2">can&#39;t be the ethics of it is totally</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:18.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.960" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.400" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">then you have things like short term</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:23.760" style="s2">versus long term</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:26.160" style="s2">and how long did the study run for and</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.760" end="00:53:28.000" style="s2">does it you know change over time and</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.160" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">and different genetic backgrounds and</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.000" end="00:53:32.079" style="s2">microbiomes and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.839" end="00:53:33.920" style="s2">and so i think the complexity of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.079" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.920" end="00:53:37.200" style="s2">is trickier than almost anyone i&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">talked to acknowledges</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.200" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">because like people coming to the issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">of race</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">they come from either that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:46.400" style="s2">absorbed</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">in critical race theory in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.400" end="00:53:49.920" style="s2">associated histories or</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.240" end="00:53:51.760" style="s2">the almost opposite kind of the social</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.920" end="00:53:53.440" style="s2">science and so the preponderance of what</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.760" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">they&#39;ve been exposed to makes them feel</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.440" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">more certain</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">and the view that they&#39;ve had of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">other side is usually their side</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">debunking the other side</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:04.400" style="s2">and so to the degree that a topic is</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:06.000" style="s2">polarized is the degree to which even if</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.400" end="00:54:08.319" style="s2">people are familiar with both sides it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.000" end="00:54:11.680" style="s2">through bias that they don&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.319" end="00:54:14.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really tricky</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.680" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">and i think the way we feed ourselves is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.240" end="00:54:18.559" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">primal right like one two three five</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.559" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">times a day i&#39;m gonna be doing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:24.319" style="s2">so somebody telling me how i should or</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t feed myself</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.319" end="00:54:28.480" style="s2">and it goes against my culture my early</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:30.559" style="s2">childhood my sense of sovereignty my</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.480" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s such a big thing and and on</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.559" end="00:54:34.880" style="s2">the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of the thermodynamic basis of</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.880" end="00:54:38.400" style="s2">our impact on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">right as a species is that thing and</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.400" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">there&#39;s so many of us</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:45.599" style="s2">that the the net collective consequence</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:46.960" style="s2">of it is so important to consider</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.599" end="00:54:48.720" style="s2">where you can&#39;t take a purely</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.960" end="00:54:50.240" style="s2">individualistic approach without kant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.720" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">categorical imperative does this work</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.240" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">for everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s just an authentically</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.280" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">tricky</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:07.760" style="s2">topic so i will share</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">a couple high-level considerations</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.760" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">so i became a vegetarian when i was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">kid when i was nine</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:17.920" style="s2">um saw a factory farming truck</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:20.400" style="s2">it was a kind of horrific scene</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.920" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">red diet for a new america got into pita</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.400" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:26.160" style="s2">animal activism and like that and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:28.720" style="s2">when i was a teenager became vegan</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.160" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">i just hadn&#39;t studied the dairy part yet</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.720" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">i i have been up until now i&#39;m 40.</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:41.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m you know my blood labs look good</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:45.200" style="s2">i lift weights you know i</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.839" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">i&#39;m in good health my energy is good so</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.200" end="00:55:50.480" style="s2">uh that works for me and i have</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:51.760" style="s2">tested at different times to see am i</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.480" end="00:55:52.160" style="s2">missing something where i don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.760" end="00:55:56.079" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.160" end="00:55:57.839" style="s2">reference so let me take a</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.079" end="00:55:59.839" style="s2">you know some small amount for a period</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.839" end="00:56:02.000" style="s2">of time uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.839" end="00:56:04.400" style="s2">eggs or whatever it is that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.000" end="00:56:07.760" style="s2">test of the nutrient i might be missing</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.400" end="00:56:09.040" style="s2">and see do i notice a real subjective</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.760" end="00:56:10.640" style="s2">difference i&#39;m gonna have a very hard</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.040" end="00:56:11.839" style="s2">time noticing an object of difference</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.640" end="00:56:13.680" style="s2">especially when</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.839" end="00:56:15.599" style="s2">the blood labs are already in a good</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.680" end="00:56:19.280" style="s2">range</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.599" end="00:56:22.079" style="s2">and i personally have not</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.280" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">noticed a difference and i have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.079" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">many people who have</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:28.319" style="s2">and i&#39;ve known a number of people who</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">have tried to do</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.319" end="00:56:32.799" style="s2">uh vegan diets and were much healthier</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">for some period of time</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.799" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">oftentimes because it was the first diet</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">that they did really thoughtfully so it</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.599" style="s2">meant that they just cut out</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">a bunch of refined food and grains and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.599" end="00:56:43.599" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">i find that actually most any diet works</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.599" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">for somebody at first</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">if it is basically a movement from</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:50.640" style="s2">something like shitty unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.960" end="00:56:53.119" style="s2">standard american diet</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.640" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">that if it&#39;s in the direction of cleaner</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.119" end="00:56:57.280" style="s2">more whole foods more organic</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:56:58.880" style="s2">whether the macros are mostly fats</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.280" end="00:57:00.480" style="s2">mostly protein are mostly carbs they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.880" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">going to do better than they did on the</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">sugar and hydrogenated fat diet</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:07.920" style="s2">and usually any of them that they go to</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">they&#39;ll have some more consideration of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.920" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">calories and micronutrients and some</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:13.119" style="s2">basic things like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:14.559" style="s2">i find that there&#39;s a lot of diets that</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.119" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">people do well on for a short period and</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.559" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">then badly on</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">like too long on keto or too long on</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.280" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">i think realizing that most people in</p>

<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">didn&#39;t have access to the same type of</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:46.079" style="s2">makes it pretty clear that dietary</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.319" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">flexibility is the thing that was our</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.079" end="00:57:49.760" style="s2">primary evolutionary environment so</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">we would have had some times where there</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.760" end="00:57:54.799" style="s2">was more animal products</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">less animal product different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.799" end="00:58:00.559" style="s2">uh vegetation but never like</p>

<p begin="00:58:00.559" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">or as much you know like that just</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.559" end="00:58:06.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a weird thing and so i</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.200" end="00:58:08.960" style="s2">think that creates</p>

<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:20.000" style="s2">i think as far as the ethics goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:22.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that anyone puts forward a</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.000" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">reasonable case for why factory farms</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.079" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">are a good idea</p>

<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">wise i think it&#39;s one of the like</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.559" end="00:58:39.119" style="s2">obvious great blights on the world</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:42.319" style="s2">and one of the things that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.119" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">i get sad about so i have friends that</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.319" end="00:58:44.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">vegan for ethical reasons and i have</p>

<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:49.839" style="s2">reasons both of whom i respect</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.200" end="00:58:51.680" style="s2">because they&#39;re if they&#39;re in a real</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.839" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">earnest inquiry around what is true what</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.680" end="00:58:56.319" style="s2">is effective how does</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:57.599" style="s2">their choice how would it portend for</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.319" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">eight billion people doing that if</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.599" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">they&#39;re really in it</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:04.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that anyone can claim the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">basis of authority to say you have to</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.720" end="00:59:09.359" style="s2">come to this conclusion or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">a bad person uh so i mostly care about</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.359" end="00:59:13.040" style="s2">the depth of earnestness within</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">with which one is inquiring and</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.040" end="00:59:15.680" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">but sometimes i will see people go from</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">say a vegetarian</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">conversation to a a conversation where</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:26.240" style="s2">it ethically makes sense to eat animal</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:28.000" style="s2">products for them because they think</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.240" end="00:59:31.280" style="s2">that we can&#39;t get heme iron or</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.000" end="00:59:32.000" style="s2">b12 or evolutionary environment of</p>

<p begin="00:59:32.000" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">or whatever it is they have some</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:37.280" style="s2">argument like that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">that would justify going in bow hunting</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.280" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">or something</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">but because of that they just slide to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:44.400" style="s2">animals or in rather than out and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">they&#39;ll eat mcdonald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.400" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">and i think that is super sloppy</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:52.799" style="s2">ethically right so how much meat does</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">somebody need to eat if they feel that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.799" end="00:59:55.839" style="s2">they need to eat some and how was it</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">sourced</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.839" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">is really important not just a binary</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">it&#39;s all in or it&#39;s all out</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">right i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:06.000" style="s2">if someone</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:12.960" style="s2">has endeavored to apply a vegan diet</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.440" end="01:00:15.359" style="s2">well and they have tried to study the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.960" end="01:00:18.240" style="s2">nutrition of it and they</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.359" end="01:00:19.920" style="s2">don&#39;t feel that they can be as healthy</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.240" end="01:00:21.920" style="s2">then there&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.920" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">straightforward ethical conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.920" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">around it&#39;s not causing</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.520" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">unnecessary suffering to kill some other</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:30.960" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">because they are in some ongoing degree</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.960" end="01:00:32.960" style="s2">of suffering by not doing it so now</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:34.799" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.960" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">weighing sufferings and now we&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.799" end="01:00:38.400" style="s2">in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">authentically difficult trolley problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.400" end="01:00:41.359" style="s2">right but we&#39;re in a real ethical</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">problem as opposed to just a black and</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.359" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">white it was unnecessary suffering for</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:46.960" style="s2">no good reason</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">um of course there are heaps of</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.960" end="01:00:50.880" style="s2">questions under this around</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">but how do we know what the subjective</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.880" end="01:00:54.400" style="s2">experience or consciousness of an animal</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">is compared to a plant and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.400" end="01:00:57.680" style="s2">i address some of those in that dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:58.640" style="s2">that you saw and that takes a little</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.680" end="01:01:02.240" style="s2">while</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.640" end="01:01:04.319" style="s2">um and i i wouldn&#39;t consider</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.240" end="01:01:06.079" style="s2">the same type of proto-qualia for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.319" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">blade of wheatgrass as i would for</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.079" end="01:01:10.640" style="s2">a redwood tree like i think those types</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:14.960" style="s2">of categories are also nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.640" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">um or obviously for a clam as for a</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.960" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">chimpanzee in the domain of animal</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.160" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.079" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">when we think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:31.280" style="s2">when we think about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:35.200" style="s2">principles of ethics one of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.280" end="01:01:36.880" style="s2">uh this again a lot of things forest did</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.200" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">a very good job formalizing</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.880" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">the ethics of continuity and the ethics</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:44.480" style="s2">of symmetry is a really nice formal our</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">way of framing up ethics writ large</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.480" end="01:01:47.520" style="s2">ethics of symmetry is one of the main</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:49.119" style="s2">ways we think about ethics</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.520" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">which is do unto others as you would</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.119" end="01:01:55.520" style="s2">have them do unto you</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:59.839" style="s2">or um rawls is original position</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.520" end="01:02:01.440" style="s2">right you design a society</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.839" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">but you don&#39;t know which of the roles</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.440" end="01:02:04.240" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be put into and design a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:06.480" style="s2">society in a way where you&#39;d be okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.240" end="01:02:08.559" style="s2">being put into any of the roles</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.480" end="01:02:10.000" style="s2">and make sure that if you design a deal</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">with somebody that you&#39;d be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.000" end="01:02:16.160" style="s2">take any side of the deal</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">um pie slice theorem i can slice the pie</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.160" end="01:02:18.720" style="s2">but you get a pick</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:20.480" style="s2">or you can slice it and i pick but i</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.720" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">don&#39;t get a slice and pick</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.480" end="01:02:23.839" style="s2">so these are ethics of symmetry would i</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:25.839" style="s2">trade places do i</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.839" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">actually feel that the thing i&#39;m dealing</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.839" end="01:02:28.960" style="s2">is fair</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:30.400" style="s2">not in a sense but the embodied</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.960" end="01:02:32.720" style="s2">sense i trade places</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.400" end="01:02:34.319" style="s2">so if we extend that to animals as</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.720" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">sentient creatures and say would i trade</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.319" end="01:02:36.960" style="s2">places here</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">if people aren&#39;t asking that question</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.039" end="01:02:45.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they have contemplated the</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:48.720" style="s2">ethics yet</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.119" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">and and asking</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.720" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">the way we design a system for say</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:56.480" style="s2">a species right cows or chickens in</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:57.920" style="s2">relationship to humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.480" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">from rawls&#39;s point of view would i be</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.920" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">willing to be put into the cow place</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">there or in the human place and say like</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:06.079" style="s2">position or did i design something were</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">there positions i totally wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.079" end="01:03:10.720" style="s2">to be put into it&#39;s some form of</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">um you know what we would consider</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.720" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">abject slavery or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.960" end="01:03:18.640" style="s2">so i think thinking through that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:22.720" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.640" end="01:03:26.400" style="s2">and so the hunters that i</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.720" end="01:03:28.400" style="s2">respect have a complex relationship with</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.400" end="01:03:31.280" style="s2">killing every time</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.400" end="01:03:34.799" style="s2">like they have some basis by which they</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.280" end="01:03:34.799" style="s2">feel like that is actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.880" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">you know there&#39;s too many deer in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:39.359" style="s2">area because we&#39;ve killed the apex</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.039" style="s2">predators in the area they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.359" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">helping to balance the environment</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.039" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">getting that there</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">as opposed to factory farm meat is</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:47.520" style="s2">better even as opposed to agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">that&#39;s coming through conventional</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.520" end="01:03:51.839" style="s2">agriculture producing wheat that is</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:53.440" style="s2">you know destroyed whole forest lands</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.839" end="01:03:54.000" style="s2">that that feels like the right thing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.440" end="01:03:55.680" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.000" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">but it also doesn&#39;t feel like nothing to</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.680" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">them to kill the animal</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:01.039" style="s2">knowing that what that animal is</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">experiencing is a real experience and</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.039" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">what the other animals that were part of</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:06.160" style="s2">that hurt or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:08.000" style="s2">are experiencing watching it and even</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.160" end="01:04:08.880" style="s2">more so if i raised it my whole life</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.000" end="01:04:12.400" style="s2">right and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.880" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">the thing shifts so i think someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.400" end="01:04:16.559" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">with it should be complex</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.559" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">right like i think if it&#39;s really simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s because someone has actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">stopped wrestling with the wholeness of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.720" end="01:04:24.880" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.200" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">and if you look at most of the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">tribal cultures they had a very strong</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:32.319" style="s2">no waste orientation right they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">take more than they needed</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.319" end="01:04:36.160" style="s2">and so in a situation where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:38.240" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about health but then most</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.160" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">people are obese on the thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">no that&#39;s up right um does it</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:43.599" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:44.880" style="s2">to take it from much worse sources and</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.599" end="01:04:46.559" style="s2">more than is needed in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.880" end="01:04:50.000" style="s2">actually harming me not helping me</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.559" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">no that&#39;s ethically up i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.000" end="01:04:54.079" style="s2">hold that everyone sh</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">necessarily can or should be vegan i</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.079" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">hope that some people can i don&#39;t hold</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:04:58.559" style="s2">that no</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:05:00.880" style="s2">no one can from experience of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.559" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">long-term people are quite healthy</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.880" end="01:05:07.280" style="s2">um i hold that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:10.319" style="s2">everyone can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.280" end="01:05:13.359" style="s2">much more responsible with their choices</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.319" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">and you know like</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:18.960" style="s2">also i i try very very hard not to buy</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.599" style="s2">plant products that come from</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.960" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">conventional sources that had damaging</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:25.119" style="s2">effects on the environment</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">in the nature of how the conventional</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.119" end="01:05:28.559" style="s2">agriculture works so it&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">another binary that people do</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.559" end="01:05:31.680" style="s2">of like meats in so i&#39;ll take the</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:33.760" style="s2">factory farm stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.680" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">or i don&#39;t do meat so whatever plants i</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.760" end="01:05:37.359" style="s2">do are fine no</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.720" style="s2">no like the the the glyphosate wheat</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.359" end="01:05:40.319" style="s2">that is up the environment or</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.720" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">whatever is actually really bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.319" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">um and kills lots of animals and the</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:43.760" style="s2">nature of how those threshers work and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:45.599" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.760" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">you know field mice and snakes and birds</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.599" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">and pollinators and whatever</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.839" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">um i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.039" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">hard for us when we&#39;re dealing with very</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:57.680" style="s2">large supply chains that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">emotionally disconnected from</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.680" end="01:06:02.880" style="s2">whereas if i was growing all of my own</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:04.799" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.880" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">picking picking a carrot just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.799" end="01:06:06.480" style="s2">feel the same as slitting a goat&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:07.920" style="s2">throat</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.480" end="01:06:09.599" style="s2">they don&#39;t feel like the same kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.920" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">experience and there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.599" end="01:06:12.720" style="s2">something that goes with being connected</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">to that whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.720" end="01:06:19.599" style="s2">and honestly picking a carrot or</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">wild harvesting a berry doesn&#39;t feel the</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.599" end="01:06:23.200" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">as clear cutting an area of forest to</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.200" end="01:06:29.839" style="s2">create row agriculture does</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:31.680" style="s2">right and so to try to take these very</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.839" end="01:06:32.880" style="s2">large-scale things that are invisible to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.680" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.880" end="01:06:37.119" style="s2">like go to the factory farm go to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">conventional farm go to where clear</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.119" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">cutting&#39;s happening go</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">to the landfill and really get in touch</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:45.280" style="s2">with what your life is producing</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:46.960" style="s2">and then say how do i actually take</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.280" end="01:06:49.599" style="s2">better responsibility for this</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.960" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">now one can go excessive here and try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.599" end="01:06:52.000" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:53.280" style="s2">not causing harm be the whole thing they</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.000" end="01:06:55.760" style="s2">focus on their life will just get</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.280" end="01:06:57.760" style="s2">smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.760" end="01:06:59.599" style="s2">because they actually realize if i drive</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.760" end="01:07:01.920" style="s2">on the road i&#39;m causing</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.599" end="01:07:03.680" style="s2">an electric car versus a gas car my bike</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.920" end="01:07:06.240" style="s2">the rubber where&#39;d it come from though</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.680" end="01:07:08.160" style="s2">and so that can just shrink you into</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.240" end="01:07:10.240" style="s2">there is no way to have your hands</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.160" end="01:07:13.039" style="s2">totally clean in a world</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.240" end="01:07:14.480" style="s2">that is built on institutional violence</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.039" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">right like it is institutional</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.480" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">structural violence</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:18.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s a certain place where i am</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:20.720" style="s2">complicit by being in it</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.799" end="01:07:22.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of ethical humility that has</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.720" end="01:07:23.280" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.119" style="s2">but then to also say i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.280" end="01:07:28.079" style="s2">minimize those harms while also</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.119" end="01:07:29.680" style="s2">maximizing my capacity to change it and</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.079" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">if i&#39;ll never fly on a plane because of</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.680" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">the climate change but that also means i</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">can&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">possibly influence the thing at the un</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">or wherever it is that i got invited to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:40.240" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.359" end="01:07:41.839" style="s2">then i might be causing less harm in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.240" end="01:07:43.039" style="s2">moment but decreasing my capacity for a</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.839" end="01:07:44.480" style="s2">larger offset</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.039" end="01:07:46.000" style="s2">but then again that doesn&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.480" end="01:07:47.440" style="s2">well i don&#39;t think about plane flights</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.000" end="01:07:48.960" style="s2">at all and i will do infinite amounts of</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.440" end="01:07:50.319" style="s2">them because i got put into the binary</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.960" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">category called plane flights are cool</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.319" end="01:07:53.760" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">i how to really take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.760" end="01:07:57.039" style="s2">the things that i&#39;m affecting but i</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:58.319" style="s2">can&#39;t tell i&#39;m affecting</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.039" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">right i can&#39;t tell because they&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.319" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">of my senses</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.280" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">that&#39;s the deeper consideration i would</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.880" end="01:08:05.119" style="s2">offer</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.880" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">any follow-up question carrie no that</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:12.960" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:14.960" style="s2">uh really excellent thank you i live at</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.960" end="01:08:17.679" style="s2">a regenerative agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.960" end="01:08:18.560" style="s2">eco village and um sitting with</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.679" end="01:08:21.359" style="s2">potentially</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:21.679" style="s2">uh exploring this complex relationship</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.359" end="01:08:24.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.679" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">killing a chicken and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.880" end="01:08:29.839" style="s2">that really was wonderful thank you</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:34.159" style="s2">all right i&#39;ll say one more thing about</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:37.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.159" end="01:08:40.319" style="s2">when i was a kid i uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.520" end="01:08:41.679" style="s2">really just loved animals and took in</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.319" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">all the sick and injured animals i could</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.679" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">find in our house became kind of like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">animal rehab place for some time and</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:50.960" style="s2">that also meant that there were animals</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:52.880" style="s2">that weren&#39;t going to get better that</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.960" end="01:08:55.279" style="s2">were really suffering that we had to</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.880" end="01:08:56.319" style="s2">kill put out of ongoing unnecessary</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.279" end="01:08:58.319" style="s2">suffering</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.319" end="01:08:59.440" style="s2">so starting somewhat young i learned how</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.319" end="01:09:02.960" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.440" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">mercifully kill something that i</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.960" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">was dedicated to trying to save right</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:09.679" style="s2">that i cared about</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:11.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very interesting process</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.679" end="01:09:12.880" style="s2">right vets obviously have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.040" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">go through that and typically one</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.880" end="01:09:16.159" style="s2">desensitizes when they do too much of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:17.279" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.159" end="01:09:18.880" style="s2">like think about someone who became a</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.279" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">vet because they love animals and now</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.880" end="01:09:20.799" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:22.560" style="s2">in a situation where they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.799" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">euthanizing beautiful dogs all day long</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">because people are and breed dogs</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">and they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.199" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">um like how do you not shut down</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.960" end="01:09:32.839" style="s2">and so i had a process that every time i</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">killed an animal</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.839" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">i i was</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">completely tuned in with it right i was</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.560" style="s2">feeling it i was loving it i was wishing</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">that i had been able to help it more</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.560" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">and i cried every time right but i also</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.759" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.239" end="01:09:48.960" style="s2">not do it because it needed done so like</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:50.159" style="s2">you have to both have the courage and</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.960" end="01:09:52.159" style="s2">the sensitivity bound</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.159" end="01:09:53.120" style="s2">and if you go on either side where you</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.159" end="01:09:54.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have the courage or the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.120" end="01:09:56.400" style="s2">sensitivity</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.080" end="01:09:58.000" style="s2">you kind of fall off the razor&#39;s edge</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.400" end="01:09:59.840" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.000" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">so when you have that experience with</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.840" end="01:10:05.600" style="s2">the chicken and the community does</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">that they really just feel and hold the</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.600" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.239" end="01:10:15.120" style="s2">thank you yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:17.120" style="s2">all right we have 15 minutes left so um</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.120" end="01:10:18.800" style="s2">we&#39;ll sneak in this question from evan</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.120" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll close up</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.800" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">uh evan i pasted your question</p>

<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">it to daniel</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">yeah thank you so um i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:31.679" style="s2">people on the stoa</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:33.280" style="s2">might be in a similar spot to me here</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.679" end="01:10:34.080" style="s2">and so i&#39;m going to ask this question</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.280" end="01:10:36.800" style="s2">kind of generally</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.080" end="01:10:38.960" style="s2">um so a lot of us want to spend more of</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.800" end="01:10:40.880" style="s2">our time and energy helping to actualize</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.960" end="01:10:42.640" style="s2">the sort of non-rival risk systems and</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.880" end="01:10:46.000" style="s2">dynamics of the future that</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.640" end="01:10:47.280" style="s2">you talk about and um but are also in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.000" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">situation where we will be</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.280" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">literally homeless if we don&#39;t keep our</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:52.800" style="s2">day jobs within a month or two</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:54.000" style="s2">um and these day jobs require us to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.800" end="01:10:57.360" style="s2">spend our time</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.000" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">in a game a or rivalrous kind of context</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.360" end="01:11:00.960" style="s2">and um so i i would just love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:03.760" style="s2">your take on</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.960" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">how one can actually make moves in one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.760" end="01:11:09.280" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.719" end="01:11:10.800" style="s2">to um to move into a way of making</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.280" end="01:11:12.560" style="s2">one&#39;s way in the world for oneself and</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.800" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">one&#39;s family making a living in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.560" end="01:11:16.480" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:19.040" style="s2">um without being so</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.480" end="01:11:19.600" style="s2">deeply attached and dependent on these</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.040" end="01:11:21.840" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.600" end="01:11:23.760" style="s2">um you know rivalrous game a corporate</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.840" end="01:11:27.120" style="s2">dynamics that that most of us have to</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.760" end="01:11:29.840" style="s2">spend you know eight hours a day doing</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.120" end="01:11:29.840" style="s2">yeah i get it</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.920" end="01:11:35.679" style="s2">the best answer i have isn&#39;t awesome</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.760" end="01:11:46.480" style="s2">so things that i did</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.280" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">one was for most of my life i kept my</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.480" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">overhead extremely low</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.840" end="01:11:54.239" style="s2">and so i did life design that made it to</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.080" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">where i wasn&#39;t on the hamster wheel</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.239" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">of you know make a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:01.360" style="s2">and then want to spend a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:03.520" style="s2">on all the things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.360" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">society makes it very easy to want to</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.520" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">spend it on that</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:07.920" style="s2">then binds me to that thing because i</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">was very clear that i was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.920" end="01:12:10.719" style="s2">liberate my time</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.040" end="01:12:15.520" style="s2">and then i sought what are the ways that</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.480" end="01:12:19.040" style="s2">i can make</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.520" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">more dollars per hour doing things that</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.040" end="01:12:22.400" style="s2">i believe are good</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:23.920" style="s2">even if they&#39;re not the very best things</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:24.400" style="s2">because i&#39;m not trying to get my sense</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.920" end="01:12:25.600" style="s2">of how</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.400" end="01:12:27.040" style="s2">my theory of change in the world is</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.600" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">going to ever give me dollars maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.040" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">will but</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:31.199" style="s2">i i&#39;m not connected to that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:33.199" style="s2">going to do something high dollar power</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.199" end="01:12:37.199" style="s2">that i think is really bad</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.199" end="01:12:38.960" style="s2">um so when i was doing construction as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.199" end="01:12:41.440" style="s2">kid going through college</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.960" end="01:12:42.960" style="s2">i remember seeing that uh the</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.440" end="01:12:44.560" style="s2">electricians made more than people</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.960" end="01:12:46.159" style="s2">framing and i was framing so i</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.560" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">taught myself electrical work and then</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.159" end="01:12:49.040" style="s2">started doing that right like i just</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">kept seeing how do i increase the</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.040" end="01:12:52.000" style="s2">dollars per hour</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">to not increase the total dollars but to</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.000" end="01:12:55.520" style="s2">decrease the hours</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:57.120" style="s2">while keeping the dollar needs more</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.520" end="01:13:00.159" style="s2">fixed</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.120" end="01:13:01.840" style="s2">and you know then i was</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.159" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">doing counseling work with people and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.840" end="01:13:04.880" style="s2">then i learned that doing executive</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">coaching was basically counseling that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.880" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">charged more</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:09.440" style="s2">and then i learned that strategic</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:09.920" style="s2">business consulting for businesses made</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.440" end="01:13:11.600" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.920" end="01:13:13.040" style="s2">than the executive coaching thing did it</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.600" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">was like what skills would i need to</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.040" end="01:13:16.159" style="s2">develop to actually be able to help here</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.239" style="s2">that are also teaching me something</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.159" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">interesting and valuable</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.239" end="01:13:22.480" style="s2">and then how do i progressively keep the</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:23.840" style="s2">hours lower where the rest of my hours</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.480" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">get to keep growing and know that it</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.840" end="01:13:26.640" style="s2">won&#39;t happen that instantly like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:29.199" style="s2">development of right</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.640" end="01:13:33.199" style="s2">profession is as you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.199" end="01:13:37.840" style="s2">developmental process years</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.199" end="01:13:41.360" style="s2">uh and if someone</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.840" end="01:13:43.440" style="s2">now i mostly never had a job like a w-2</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.360" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">type thing i mostly took contractor type</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.440" end="01:13:47.520" style="s2">positions</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:49.280" style="s2">where i could control the dynamics of my</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.520" end="01:13:50.800" style="s2">hours and charge and like that better</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.280" end="01:13:54.159" style="s2">not not everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.800" end="01:13:57.440" style="s2">oriented to do that as well</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.159" end="01:13:58.960" style="s2">if you&#39;re in an eight-hour position uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.440" end="01:14:01.520" style="s2">and you don&#39;t know how to make more</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.960" end="01:14:03.440" style="s2">dollars per hour in some obvious way</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.520" end="01:14:05.679" style="s2">and obviously taking the time to explore</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.440" end="01:14:06.880" style="s2">how to do that is time outside of those</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:15.679" style="s2">eight hours that you&#39;re not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.880" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">figure out anti-rivalrous stuff with um</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.679" end="01:14:18.800" style="s2">a few things i would say</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.320" end="01:14:25.520" style="s2">the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.600" end="01:14:27.440" style="s2">under feudalism for most of the history</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.520" end="01:14:28.000" style="s2">of the world could never ask this</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.440" end="01:14:29.280" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.000" end="01:14:31.280" style="s2">like they didn&#39;t have eight hours and</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.280" end="01:14:33.520" style="s2">then some free time and some access to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.280" end="01:14:35.440" style="s2">knowledge and development</p>

<p begin="01:14:35.440" end="01:14:37.920" style="s2">economically freed themselves they</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.880" end="01:14:41.040" style="s2">weren&#39;t forced</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.920" end="01:14:43.360" style="s2">into some position like it is</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.040" end="01:14:45.679" style="s2">even to be in what seems like economic</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.360" end="01:14:46.880" style="s2">servitude here have no money in savings</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.679" end="01:14:48.080" style="s2">and be you know a month away from</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.080" end="01:14:52.159" style="s2">but to not be working 12 or 14 hours</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:56.159" style="s2">obligately a day</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.159" end="01:14:57.920" style="s2">um is actually a situation that allows</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.159" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">us an upward vector that most people</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.920" end="01:15:00.239" style="s2">never had</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:03.280" style="s2">and most people in the world still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.239" end="01:15:04.320" style="s2">have now to say but i&#39;m tired at</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.280" end="01:15:06.960" style="s2">the end of eight hours</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.320" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">and you know i i want i like i need to</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.960" end="01:15:12.560" style="s2">chill or rest or do something else</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:14.239" style="s2">that&#39;s real and the depth to which we</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.560" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">care about it can motivate</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.239" end="01:15:17.199" style="s2">finding more energy</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.280" end="01:15:20.880" style="s2">now one of the tricky things is like</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.640" style="s2">what resource do you focus on first to</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.880" end="01:15:24.000" style="s2">be able to leverage other resources do i</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.640" end="01:15:25.920" style="s2">just really double down and focus</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.000" end="01:15:28.640" style="s2">on money making so i can buy free time</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.920" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">and fun projects</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.640" end="01:15:33.600" style="s2">or am i gonna really try to focus on my</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:35.040" style="s2">health so i have more energy so i can</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.600" end="01:15:37.120" style="s2">work 15 hours a day</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.040" end="01:15:38.320" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve got a solid seven outside of</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.120" end="01:15:39.679" style="s2">the eight that i work</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.320" end="01:15:41.199" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna put some energy into</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.679" end="01:15:42.719" style="s2">health to have like the physical</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.199" end="01:15:44.640" style="s2">vitality to do that</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.719" end="01:15:46.159" style="s2">am i gonna try to double down on my</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.640" end="01:15:49.280" style="s2">learning straight towards</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.159" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">you know game b type things</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.280" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">i&#39;ve never found a good answer of like</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:54.640" style="s2">the order of operations is really figure</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:56.640" style="s2">out discipline first</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.640" end="01:15:58.960" style="s2">and then figure out money i found that</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.640" end="01:15:59.440" style="s2">it&#39;s like you level them all up one</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.960" end="01:16:00.800" style="s2">notch</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.440" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">and you kind of take a moment you level</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.800" end="01:16:03.840" style="s2">them all up one notch and then you level</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:07.040" style="s2">them all up one notch again</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.840" end="01:16:09.600" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.040" end="01:16:11.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s very easy to focus on how we</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.600" end="01:16:13.120" style="s2">wish it was that it isn&#39;t in a way that</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.440" end="01:16:14.640" style="s2">is disempowering that just makes us feel</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.120" end="01:16:17.440" style="s2">kind of shitty</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.640" end="01:16:18.320" style="s2">but to focus on i just don&#39;t find that a</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.440" end="01:16:21.520" style="s2">useful focus</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.320" end="01:16:22.960" style="s2">to focus on that we actually have some</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.520" end="01:16:24.480" style="s2">developmental opportunity and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.960" end="01:16:26.480" style="s2">development happening and then just keep</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.480" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">saying how do i double down on that</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.480" end="01:16:30.000" style="s2">is the most useful focus</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.239" end="01:16:34.640" style="s2">and then i would say like to the degree</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.880" end="01:16:37.360" style="s2">you&#39;re in those eight hours a day</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.640" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">can you experiment with game b type</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.360" end="01:16:40.560" style="s2">things can you even learn more about</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:42.560" style="s2">game a by</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.560" end="01:16:44.320" style="s2">bringing like not just being there kind</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.560" end="01:16:45.440" style="s2">of disengaged but saying i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.320" end="01:16:46.640" style="s2">to move up through the ranks here and</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.440" end="01:16:47.920" style="s2">learn how business really works i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.640" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">going to learn more about middleman and</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.920" end="01:16:51.360" style="s2">i&#39;m going to learn those things</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:52.480" style="s2">to just bring more like care and</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.360" end="01:16:54.560" style="s2">engagement</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.480" end="01:16:57.760" style="s2">to your learning and development i think</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.560" end="01:16:58.800" style="s2">can happen most anywhere</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.760" end="01:17:02.400" style="s2">when you realize everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.800" end="01:17:04.320" style="s2">interconnected then you realize that any</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.400" end="01:17:07.760" style="s2">domain of learning can be laterally</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.320" end="01:17:07.760" style="s2">applied to almost everything else</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.840" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.320" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">yep those are a few thoughts so quick</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.440" end="01:17:19.920" style="s2">follow-up if i may um</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:23.120" style="s2">so i i like what you had to say um</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.920" end="01:17:25.520" style="s2">i spent most of my 20s uh learning</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.120" end="01:17:27.199" style="s2">and being only occasionally employed in</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.520" end="01:17:28.159" style="s2">a more contractor-type basis like you</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.199" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">described</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:32.400" style="s2">now i&#39;m employed in a well currently in</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:36.560" style="s2">an engineering type</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.400" end="01:17:38.560" style="s2">role and i&#39;m starting to feel a pull to</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.560" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">not do that and i remember you said in</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.560" end="01:17:41.679" style="s2">one of these earlier stoa sessions that</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:43.199" style="s2">most people should probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.679" end="01:17:45.679" style="s2">have a job rather than work for</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.199" end="01:17:46.960" style="s2">themselves so i&#39;m wondering specifically</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.679" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">focusing on like</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.960" end="01:17:51.199" style="s2">how does one decide um or what is your</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:52.239" style="s2">advice for someone who is in the process</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.199" end="01:17:54.159" style="s2">of deciding</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.239" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">whether or not to continue with a pretty</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.159" end="01:17:56.880" style="s2">good job for a pretty good company</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:17:58.080" style="s2">that&#39;s making the world at least</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.880" end="01:18:00.320" style="s2">marginally better</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.080" end="01:18:02.159" style="s2">versus to strike out on one&#39;s own and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.320" end="01:18:03.600" style="s2">accept the much greater levels of</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.159" end="01:18:06.000" style="s2">uncertainty precarious</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.600" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">and risk in the service of trying to</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.000" end="01:18:08.719" style="s2">actualize something that you feel that</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:11.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve discovered in your heart and want</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.719" end="01:18:11.040" style="s2">to share</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.520" end="01:18:15.679" style="s2">i won&#39;t answer this the same for</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.280" end="01:18:19.440" style="s2">everybody because</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.679" end="01:18:21.840" style="s2">i think i&#39;ll i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.440" end="01:18:22.480" style="s2">kind of mostly just want to live a good</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.840" end="01:18:23.679" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.480" end="01:18:25.360" style="s2">and they would like to leave the world</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.679" end="01:18:26.000" style="s2">somewhat better than they found it but</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.360" end="01:18:28.159" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.000" end="01:18:29.120" style="s2">hugely aspirational or ambitious about</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.159" end="01:18:32.719" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.120" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay i think that has always</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.719" end="01:18:34.880" style="s2">and will</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:36.640" style="s2">maybe always be the case that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.880" end="01:18:38.159" style="s2">where most people are</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.640" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">and so have a job that is doing</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.159" end="01:18:43.120" style="s2">something somewhat good</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:43.679" style="s2">and also allows some free time and some</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.120" end="01:18:46.320" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.679" end="01:18:46.320" style="s2">is probably great</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.679" end="01:18:57.280" style="s2">if you are</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.080" end="01:18:58.080" style="s2">possessed by a need to solve problems</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.280" end="01:19:02.640" style="s2">that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.080" end="01:19:02.640" style="s2">not solve then it&#39;s a different answer</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.719" end="01:19:11.600" style="s2">in which case i would say</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.080" end="01:19:12.159" style="s2">i would take a job if and only if there</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.600" end="01:19:14.320" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.159" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">really strong developmental opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.320" end="01:19:18.640" style="s2">in it but not just to maintain myself in</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:21.840" style="s2">my life but if</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.640" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">i had the opportunity to either learn a</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.840" end="01:19:24.640" style="s2"> ton you&#39;re an engineer and you get</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:25.920" style="s2">to work with some of the best engineers</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.640" end="01:19:26.880" style="s2">in the world and your software skills</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.920" end="01:19:28.960" style="s2">get to become epic</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.880" end="01:19:30.320" style="s2">which can really help future in</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.960" end="01:19:31.840" style="s2">which case when i&#39;m there i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.320" end="01:19:32.960" style="s2">stay eight hours i&#39;d say 12 hours</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.840" end="01:19:34.159" style="s2">picking those guys brain doing</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.960" end="01:19:35.280" style="s2">additional and trying to learn</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:36.400" style="s2">everything i could right i would</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.280" end="01:19:37.679" style="s2">actually take the developmental</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.400" end="01:19:40.159" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.679" end="01:19:41.520" style="s2">or you have the ability to not just</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.159" end="01:19:43.280" style="s2">perfect your craft but</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.520" end="01:19:44.960" style="s2">adjacent areas you can move up in</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.280" end="01:19:46.480" style="s2">management and other things and learn</p>

<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:58.960" style="s2">wish we didn&#39;t ask the</p>

<p begin="01:21:03.920" end="01:21:07.600" style="s2">um but it&#39;s actually one of the most</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.080" end="01:21:09.040" style="s2">important questions and</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.600" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">base of like how do we take care of</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.040" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">ourselves as a human and what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">impact of that and how do we think</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:15.600" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.159" end="01:21:15.920" style="s2">that um and how do we come up with our</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.600" end="01:21:18.159" style="s2">own</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.920" end="01:21:19.840" style="s2">ethics that we care about so much we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.159" end="01:21:21.440" style="s2">willing to modify our own life without</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.840" end="01:21:22.239" style="s2">trying to force that on everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.440" end="01:21:23.840" style="s2">and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.239" end="01:21:25.120" style="s2">feel okay not forcing it on everyone</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.840" end="01:21:26.719" style="s2">else if we&#39;re so sure it&#39;s right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.120" end="01:21:30.360" style="s2">willing to sacrifice for it</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.719" end="01:21:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a microcosm of how to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.360" end="01:21:33.679" style="s2">israel-palestine and shiite chuni and</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.400" end="01:21:38.080" style="s2">every other major</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.679" end="01:21:39.600" style="s2"> like that in the world so um</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.080" end="01:21:41.440" style="s2">yeah and the question of like how do i</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.600" end="01:21:42.800" style="s2">take care of my financial needs in the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.440" end="01:21:44.159" style="s2">world while wanting to</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.800" end="01:21:46.239" style="s2">contribute to something else like these</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.159" end="01:21:47.760" style="s2">are all</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.239" end="01:21:49.840" style="s2">i think every one of these are questions</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.760" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">that all of us have to wrestle with</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.840" end="01:21:53.360" style="s2">and how do we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.679" end="01:21:58.880" style="s2">live in this world while trying to move</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.719" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">it towards a better world</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.880" end="01:22:02.960" style="s2">and so i&#39;m hoping that the questions</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:06.000" style="s2">that other people asked other people</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.960" end="01:22:08.560" style="s2">found interesting and meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.000" end="01:22:09.600" style="s2">um i would love to hear if people you</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.560" end="01:22:13.199" style="s2">know want to write</p>
