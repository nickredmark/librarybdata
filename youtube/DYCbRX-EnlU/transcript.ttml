<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:29.100" style="s2">periods which are very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.890" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">natural adaptive processes in which many</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.100" end="00:03:35.150" style="s2">configurations of outcomes are tried but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:38.760" style="s2">few achieve the right fit or resonance</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.150" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">in these periods a bright idea might</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.760" end="00:03:44.370" style="s2">fizzle out while deep silence or dark</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:48.359" style="s2">tension might spark a wave of</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.370" end="00:03:50.910" style="s2">inspiration we know that the process</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.359" end="00:03:53.459" style="s2">depends strongly on relational dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.910" end="00:03:55.170" style="s2">in that relational dynamics are</p>

<p begin="00:03:57.959" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">subtle energetics and finally we know</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.560" end="00:04:07.080" style="s2">that it is impossible to determine what</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:10.010" style="s2">is a beneficial contribution from what</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.080" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">is not since everything that happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.010" end="00:04:15.300" style="s2">contributes to the adaptive process</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:24.720" style="s2">that therefore the greatest potential</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:27.810" style="s2">for collective insight happens in groups</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.720" end="00:04:30.479" style="s2">where people learn to be clan amiss with</p>
