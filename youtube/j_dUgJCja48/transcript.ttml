<p begin="00:16:45.300" end="00:16:51.209" style="s2">and the other is platonic mysticism by</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.029" end="00:17:00.329" style="s2">of course within the Neoplatonic strand</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.829" end="00:17:02.009" style="s2">of Christianity on</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.049" end="00:19:43.720" style="s2">salient to you don&#39;t don&#39;t try and</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.779" end="00:19:45.909" style="s2">explain why don&#39;t don&#39;t theorize</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.720" end="00:19:47.529" style="s2">something will jump out at you something</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.909" end="00:19:48.850" style="s2">will be catchy for you even if it</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.529" end="00:19:51.279" style="s2">moderately sometimes will be strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.850" end="00:19:53.440" style="s2">sometimes it will be moderate right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.279" end="00:19:56.500" style="s2">try to know what catches you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.440" end="00:19:58.929" style="s2">salient to you okay so you&#39;re reading in</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.500" end="00:20:00.700" style="s2">this reverential and then you&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.700" end="00:20:06.880" style="s2">do embodied emotion so pick up the</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.760" end="00:20:09.039" style="s2">phrase that caught you my third salient</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.880" end="00:20:11.289" style="s2">start repeating it to yourself almost</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.039" end="00:20:13.210" style="s2">like a mantra and let up most of all</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.289" end="00:20:15.070" style="s2">associations come up and as the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.210" end="00:20:19.299" style="s2">time as you&#39;re doing that try to find</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.070" end="00:20:22.149" style="s2">whatever imagery was in the what you</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.299" end="00:20:25.899" style="s2">read and especially perhaps in what</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.149" end="00:20:28.620" style="s2">standing up for you and do practice it</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.899" end="00:20:31.419" style="s2">imaginably not imagining it in your head</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.620" end="00:20:33.909" style="s2">imagining is if you are literally acting</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.419" end="00:20:36.429" style="s2">out the metaphor so literal eyes that at</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.909" end="00:20:39.429" style="s2">first act it out and let your emotions</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.429" end="00:20:41.799" style="s2">associates right so I&#39;ll show you how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.429" end="00:20:43.720" style="s2">do this but what you&#39;re doing is your</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.799" end="00:20:46.870" style="s2">imagination you&#39;re acting it out and</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.720" end="00:20:50.470" style="s2">you&#39;re mostly associating with it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.870" end="00:20:53.080" style="s2">really reaching into how much of your</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.470" end="00:20:54.029" style="s2">ability to make sense of things it comes</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.080" end="00:20:55.559" style="s2">up from your body</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.029" end="00:20:56.940" style="s2">and how you&#39;re interacting with the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.559" end="00:20:59.489" style="s2">world and we&#39;ve talked about this a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.940" end="00:21:02.309" style="s2">in the course okay so you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.489" end="00:21:05.580" style="s2">enacted engagement you&#39;ve done embodied</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.309" end="00:21:08.700" style="s2">emotion okay next you can do the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.580" end="00:21:10.710" style="s2">existential ethical move so what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.700" end="00:21:12.599" style="s2">existential ethical move the third-stage</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.710" end="00:21:14.609" style="s2">the existential ethical is when you get</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.599" end="00:21:16.200" style="s2">a sense of what it&#39;s like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.609" end="00:21:18.149" style="s2">what what&#39;s it what&#39;s your perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.200" end="00:21:20.249" style="s2">like what&#39;s how is your world being</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.149" end="00:21:23.070" style="s2">shaped right what would it be like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.249" end="00:21:25.830" style="s2">live in this perspective that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.070" end="00:21:27.719" style="s2">engendered in the first two stages as if</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.830" end="00:21:29.249" style="s2">you it became sort of your default mode</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.719" end="00:21:31.889" style="s2">of consciousness what would it be like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.249" end="00:21:33.899" style="s2">to live this way how would you move</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.889" end="00:21:35.489" style="s2">around the world really try to get a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.899" end="00:21:39.089" style="s2">sense of what it would be like as if</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.489" end="00:21:40.529" style="s2">this became a second nature perspective</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.089" end="00:21:41.159" style="s2">for you not just one that you were</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.529" end="00:21:43.529" style="s2">realized</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.159" end="00:21:45.269" style="s2">so really let it soak in this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.529" end="00:21:47.219" style="s2">the existential ethical you&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.269" end="00:21:50.969" style="s2">trying to see what would this feel like</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.219" end="00:21:53.759" style="s2">as a way of life a way of being a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.969" end="00:21:55.229" style="s2">seeing the world and then that moves you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.759" end="00:21:58.320" style="s2">very mmediately to the fourth stage</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.229" end="00:21:59.999" style="s2">which is the exstatic which literally</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.320" end="00:22:02.099" style="s2">means to stand beyond yourself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.999" end="00:22:07.229" style="s2">what ecstasy originally means ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.099" end="00:22:09.809" style="s2">eternal from that perspective try to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.229" end="00:22:12.239" style="s2">an inkling maybe even an insight what is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.809" end="00:22:13.919" style="s2">being disclosed to you about being what</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.239" end="00:22:17.159" style="s2">is being disclosed you about the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.919" end="00:22:18.690" style="s2">and correspondingly what is being</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.159" end="00:22:21.989" style="s2">demanded from you so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.690" end="00:22:24.659" style="s2">conform to that realization notice the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.989" end="00:22:26.460" style="s2">word I&#39;m using to that realization what</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.659" end="00:22:29.299" style="s2">is to be how do you would you need to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.460" end="00:22:32.009" style="s2">transformed in order to conform to that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.299" end="00:22:35.369" style="s2">deeper reality that is being disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.009" end="00:22:36.690" style="s2">to you okay so let&#39;s review and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.369" end="00:22:38.849" style="s2">we&#39;re going I&#39;m going to do it I&#39;ll talk</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.690" end="00:22:40.649" style="s2">you through what it&#39;s like for me again</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.849" end="00:22:43.379" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t you&#39;re not supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.649" end="00:22:45.719" style="s2">having my experience I&#39;m modeling what</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.379" end="00:22:47.659" style="s2">it&#39;s like for me so that you can then do</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.719" end="00:22:52.769" style="s2">it immediately when we&#39;re done today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.659" end="00:22:56.129" style="s2">session for yourself okay so enacted</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.769" end="00:22:59.219" style="s2">engagement set the intention to resonate</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.129" end="00:23:02.190" style="s2">with the text to be transformed in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.219" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">reading read aloud but something catchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.190" end="00:23:07.780" style="s2">let something grab you</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:09.960" style="s2">embodied emotion emotionally resonate</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.780" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">with us but emotions and associations</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.960" end="00:23:14.530" style="s2">come up with that also whatever</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:16.150" style="s2">metaphors are in them literalized them</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.530" end="00:23:19.570" style="s2">actually as if you were to you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.150" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">enact them alright really pick that up</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.570" end="00:23:25.780" style="s2">you&#39;re really enacting and embodying the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:27.430" style="s2">emotion then the existential ethical</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.780" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">what would it be like if this way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.430" end="00:23:31.090" style="s2">seeing became a comprehensive way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:33.820" style="s2">being for you but this was your</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.820" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">default mode of consciousness how would</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:43.120" style="s2">that be like how to imagine them it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:46.990" style="s2">some sensitive and then when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.120" end="00:23:50.320" style="s2">within that the exstatic eternal what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.990" end="00:23:51.970" style="s2">being disclosed to you maybe it&#39;s only</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.700" end="00:26:59.470" style="s2">the world it was like everything was</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.230" end="00:27:02.320" style="s2">singing its name I am a tree I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.470" end="00:27:04.000" style="s2">flower on a blade of grass and so this</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.320" end="00:27:06.280" style="s2">is coming to my mind right now how</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.000" end="00:27:09.070" style="s2">everything is singing its name and now I</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.280" end="00:27:11.980" style="s2">actually imaginal as if I was moving</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.070" end="00:27:13.990" style="s2">around this room and that emotion is in</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.980" end="00:27:16.180" style="s2">me again in that memory everything is</p>

<p begin="00:28:36.970" end="00:28:45.190" style="s2">prose text I think it&#39;s appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:49.060" style="s2">this one this is from Plato and this is</p>

<p begin="00:28:49.060" end="00:28:53.200" style="s2">he&#39;s doing here is exemplifying the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:55.540" style="s2">state of reverence that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.200" end="00:28:59.710" style="s2">about is a dialogue between Phaedrus and</p>
