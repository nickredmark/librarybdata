<p begin="00:00:03.959" end="00:00:09.360" style="s2">idea cafe the question we are all</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.080" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">answering today or passing on which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.360" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">sometimes forget to mention as an option</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">is how do you think we transition to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:18.539" style="s2">game B so I just like to there is no</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:22.439" style="s2">right or wrong answer it&#39;s just what you</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.539" end="00:00:24.810" style="s2">individually feel is the best course of</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.439" end="00:00:26.640" style="s2">action because usual or no course of</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.810" end="00:00:30.090" style="s2">action I guess if that&#39;s what it calls</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.640" end="00:00:52.649" style="s2">to you so as always I would David&#39;s your</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.649" end="00:00:56.820" style="s2">would anybody like to start I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">willing to start if nobody else would</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.820" end="00:01:03.570" style="s2">like to I don&#39;t mind starting I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:04.920" style="s2">to be honest how do we transition to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.570" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">game B as always the question I get</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.920" end="00:01:07.740" style="s2">stuck on as has come up a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:12.330" style="s2">times in previous conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.740" end="00:01:13.530" style="s2">some of you guys so I guess I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.330" end="00:01:14.580" style="s2">gonna take a minute I&#39;m not going to use</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.530" end="00:01:19.020" style="s2">the whole five minutes I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.580" end="00:01:21.119" style="s2">take one minute just to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.020" end="00:01:27.979" style="s2">whole Trek that notion of transition to</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.119" end="00:01:27.979" style="s2">game B because I how can I put this</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">feels as though the phrase transition to</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.179" end="00:01:38.729" style="s2">game be move means moving from one game</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:41.609" style="s2">structure to another game structure and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.729" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">this the this still troubles me again</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.609" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">this has come up a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:49.100" style="s2">before but this still troubles me</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:53.590" style="s2">because that feels like a retooling of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.100" end="00:01:53.590" style="s2">game a kinda thing because gay game be</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:57.780" style="s2">at least my understanding about this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.010" end="00:01:59.909" style="s2">this is very personal like my</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.780" end="00:02:03.030" style="s2">understanding of it is that it is a meta</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.909" end="00:02:08.580" style="s2">game that it&#39;s not a game in itself but</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.030" end="00:02:09.810" style="s2">that it&#39;s a framework if you like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.580" end="00:02:12.300" style="s2">not the perfect word but a framework</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.810" end="00:02:14.730" style="s2">within if you like within which all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.300" end="00:02:17.250" style="s2">the games that we are going to play in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.730" end="00:02:18.330" style="s2">order to solve problems in order to you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.250" end="00:02:19.320" style="s2">know have people living harmoniously</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.330" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">with each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.320" end="00:02:24.120" style="s2">fed clothed house watered etc you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:27.150" style="s2">all of that stuff will emerge from game</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.120" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">B but it is not game B and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.150" end="00:02:31.500" style="s2">that&#39;s really I think all I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:34.410" style="s2">is that the idea of transiting to game B</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.500" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">as though game B is a thing a place you</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.410" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">know which can be defined and and and we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:43.200" style="s2">can go to I I still have trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:45.060" style="s2">that whole notion with that whole sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.200" end="00:02:48.290" style="s2">of set of vocabulary that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.060" end="00:02:48.290" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s my piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.440" end="00:02:56.990" style="s2">I forgot to mute myself who would like</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">to go next second just unmute myself</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.990" end="00:03:00.040" style="s2">when the people can raise their hand so</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:01.940" style="s2">I have to unmute and remute everybody</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.040" end="00:03:04.280" style="s2">who would like to go next</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.940" end="00:03:07.130" style="s2">I&#39;ll go transience find next I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.280" end="00:03:09.260" style="s2">really really you know in order to</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.130" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">transition I guess to a game B first you</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.260" end="00:03:13.940" style="s2">have to define what that game B is in by</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:17.270" style="s2">defined specifically I mean you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.940" end="00:03:18.830" style="s2">have a clear understanding of all you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.270" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">know who controls all the resources of</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.830" end="00:03:24.050" style="s2">the world combines them produces things</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:27.680" style="s2">distributes how things are distributed</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.050" end="00:03:31.310" style="s2">access etcetera so once you have a anew</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.680" end="00:03:33.110" style="s2">I guess a game what the rules are who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.310" end="00:03:35.420" style="s2">controlling what and what the purposes</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.110" end="00:03:36.320" style="s2">are what the rules of engagement and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.420" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2">we&#39;re going to distribute all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.320" end="00:03:40.670" style="s2">things and and have this new</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:42.380" style="s2">relationship together then we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.670" end="00:03:44.570" style="s2">about the transition how to get from</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.380" end="00:03:46.790" style="s2">where we are today to game B so once</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.570" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">that&#39;s defined then the transition I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.790" end="00:03:53.660" style="s2">suppose could be beginning so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:56.750" style="s2">still stuck I think on trying to I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.660" end="00:03:59.420" style="s2">define this game B specifically as to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.750" end="00:04:01.700" style="s2">what it is exactly that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.420" end="00:04:02.750" style="s2">build and get to I&#39;ll stop there for now</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.700" end="00:04:06.590" style="s2">we can continue the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.750" end="00:04:09.140" style="s2">afterwards all right David or Brent</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.590" end="00:04:13.190" style="s2">either of you like to go yes just raise</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.140" end="00:04:16.400" style="s2">your hands and all right go ahead David</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.190" end="00:04:20.989" style="s2">all right thanks microphones okay sounds</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:22.640" style="s2">okay so I think that room Z what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.989" end="00:04:24.980" style="s2">said this serves something for me in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.640" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">that I I&#39;m not sure that we can define</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.980" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">define it in a way to make a transition</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:35.770" style="s2">from they made it game B and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:39.140" style="s2">understand the desire to do that I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.770" end="00:04:42.050" style="s2">more in terms of I think what Bucky</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.140" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">fuller said about transitioning is is</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.050" end="00:04:46.700" style="s2">very apt that creating a new way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:48.320" style="s2">makes the old way obsolete is important</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.700" end="00:04:50.720" style="s2">rather than trying to make changes to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.320" end="00:04:53.000" style="s2">the existing to the existent phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.720" end="00:04:56.419" style="s2">strategy but I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.000" end="00:04:58.910" style="s2">challenging what I&#39;m noticing right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.419" end="00:05:02.210" style="s2">as I pay attention to the various</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.910" end="00:05:02.660" style="s2">podcasts the speakers the writers who</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.210" end="00:05:05.510" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.660" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">seem to be picking up on a common theme</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.510" end="00:05:12.800" style="s2">is that the kinds of challenges that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.220" end="00:05:15.680" style="s2">we&#39;re running into you right now speak</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.800" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">to people individually in a way that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.680" end="00:05:21.440" style="s2">us wanting to unite and yet there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:24.770" style="s2">something that feels contentious our</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.440" end="00:05:26.210" style="s2">rival risk and how we go about it so one</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.770" end="00:05:28.760" style="s2">of the things that I think is important</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.210" end="00:05:33.100" style="s2">is finding ways to merge our efforts</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.760" end="00:05:35.330" style="s2">without having to necessarily agree on</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.100" end="00:05:38.690" style="s2">all of the rules</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.330" end="00:05:42.890" style="s2">I like I like a maked Derulo megha</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.690" end="00:05:45.440" style="s2">because it&#39;s not so much a playing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.890" end="00:05:47.270" style="s2">kind of a meta rule right it is a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.440" end="00:05:50.540" style="s2">way of engaging such that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.270" end="00:05:53.420" style="s2">listen to each other and kind of discern</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.540" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">what the underlying needs are there but</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.420" end="00:05:56.810" style="s2">in the progress the feedback loops that</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.100" end="00:06:00.980" style="s2">are necessary in order to see our we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.810" end="00:06:02.780" style="s2">making progress it gets a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.980" end="00:06:04.130" style="s2">messy but I think that part of the issue</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.780" end="00:06:08.540" style="s2">is trying to think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.130" end="00:06:10.250" style="s2">strategic way for us to lay out on a map</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.540" end="00:06:13.310" style="s2">and be able to get there that way I</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.250" end="00:06:15.500" style="s2">think is problematic and leads to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.310" end="00:06:18.100" style="s2">contingence ways of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.500" end="00:06:18.100" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.910" end="00:06:32.480" style="s2">would you like to go or would you like</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.900" end="00:06:36.140" style="s2">me to go I&#39;ll go I liked what you said</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.480" end="00:06:38.660" style="s2">about Jubilee there not being any right</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.140" end="00:06:41.000" style="s2">or wrong answers of course that&#39;s key</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.660" end="00:06:43.010" style="s2">today and just expressing ourselves but</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.000" end="00:06:45.880" style="s2">I think there are some right or right</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.010" end="00:06:48.170" style="s2">and wrong answers around this issue and</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.880" end="00:06:48.920" style="s2">you know in a friendly way I&#39;d say that</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.170" end="00:06:50.360" style="s2">you&#39;re all wrong</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.920" end="00:06:53.810" style="s2">to some extent because there&#39;s too much</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.360" end="00:06:59.150" style="s2">uncertainty there um so hopefully I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.810" end="00:07:02.180" style="s2">I can propose some more determined paths</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.150" end="00:07:05.240" style="s2">to to this transition because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.180" end="00:07:06.770" style="s2">lot of systems change literature over</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.240" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">time you know over the past you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.770" end="00:07:13.790" style="s2">half century and whatnots but also very</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:16.070" style="s2">recently right and timing-wise there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.790" end="00:07:18.860" style="s2">lot more convergence of late so you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.070" end="00:07:21.140" style="s2">year and a half ago two years ago is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.860" end="00:07:23.030" style="s2">UN report that said we had 12 years to</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.140" end="00:07:27.080" style="s2">you know find a collective action</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.030" end="00:07:30.320" style="s2">solution to this kind of runaway climate</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.080" end="00:07:33.169" style="s2">change that is anthropogenic and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.320" end="00:07:35.930" style="s2">know it&#39;s it&#39;s a part of a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.169" end="00:07:37.820" style="s2">political systems failure as well right</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.930" end="00:07:39.950" style="s2">if we can&#39;t coordinate on it then then</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.820" end="00:07:41.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just going to get worse and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.950" end="00:07:43.430" style="s2">not that the world is gonna end in 12</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.240" end="00:07:46.310" style="s2">years it&#39;s that we have 10 years now we</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.430" end="00:07:49.130" style="s2">have a window to coordinate and this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.310" end="00:07:51.260" style="s2">unprecedented right so this is one kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.130" end="00:07:53.210" style="s2">of historical marker that says like we</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.260" end="00:07:55.330" style="s2">we have to do systems change and systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.210" end="00:08:00.460" style="s2">changes have happened before</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.330" end="00:08:03.050" style="s2">but this is a new global context and me</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.460" end="00:08:05.390" style="s2">several of my projects recently have</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.050" end="00:08:06.950" style="s2">been on systems transitions and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.390" end="00:08:09.169" style="s2">intersecting literature&#39;s there so</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.950" end="00:08:11.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there right and and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.169" end="00:08:15.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the we&#39;ve got the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.450" end="00:08:18.919" style="s2">plans and templates and we&#39;ve also got</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.440" end="00:08:21.979" style="s2">the time horizon you know the window of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.919" end="00:08:23.510" style="s2">opportunity mm-hmm and so there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.979" end="00:08:25.940" style="s2">I could say about that but I want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.510" end="00:08:28.580" style="s2">also shift to two politics because</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.940" end="00:08:31.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense in which you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.580" end="00:08:34.329" style="s2">politics and culture are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.450" end="00:08:36.069" style="s2">decoupled or parallel or one overtakes</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.329" end="00:08:39.369" style="s2">other to influence the course of history</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.069" end="00:08:41.799" style="s2">I don&#39;t like the notion that you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.369" end="00:08:43.689" style="s2">like like Steve ban and likes to say</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.799" end="00:08:45.329" style="s2">that the politics is downstream from</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.689" end="00:08:49.089" style="s2">culture I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.329" end="00:08:50.410" style="s2">unidirectional you know it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.089" end="00:08:58.389" style="s2">complicated than that</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.410" end="00:09:01.059" style="s2">mm-hmm but but you know by some measures</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.389" end="00:09:02.980" style="s2">you know politics is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.059" end="00:09:04.899" style="s2">inconsequential there&#39;s a huge lag</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.980" end="00:09:06.970" style="s2">behind progress and we&#39;re just it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.899" end="00:09:09.399" style="s2">kind of piecemeal progress there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.970" end="00:09:11.589" style="s2">of compromise and satisficing and we get</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.399" end="00:09:14.139" style="s2">what we get right but every once in a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.589" end="00:09:17.199" style="s2">while you have a kind of system change</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.139" end="00:09:19.509" style="s2">type candidate and there&#39;s elections you</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.199" end="00:09:23.139" style="s2">know eminent in the in the UK and the US</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.509" end="00:09:25.119" style="s2">and so it matters who you elect right</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.139" end="00:09:29.439" style="s2">and there&#39;s been a lot of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.119" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">this over the past four years and in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.439" end="00:09:34.089" style="s2">view there&#39;s only one kind of systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:37.360" style="s2">change can that&#39;s Bernie Sanders right</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.089" end="00:09:42.540" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to get any immediate</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.360" end="00:09:47.439" style="s2">transition or actions towards gain be</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.540" end="00:09:50.769" style="s2">with you know p-put agender or Elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.439" end="00:09:53.279" style="s2">Warren or a Amy Klobuchar whoever and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.769" end="00:09:56.579" style="s2">the media is still pumping up these</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.279" end="00:09:59.049" style="s2">alternative candidates and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.579" end="00:10:02.049" style="s2">various degrees they have money backing</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.049" end="00:10:07.360" style="s2">them right making them look more viable</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.049" end="00:10:10.839" style="s2">than they are mean but you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.360" end="00:10:12.189" style="s2">Bernie Sanders movement as a whole it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.839" end="00:10:14.679" style="s2">not just about him it&#39;s it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.189" end="00:10:18.189" style="s2">the biggest mass progressive movement</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.679" end="00:10:22.149" style="s2">right so there&#39;s there&#39;s this pressure</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.189" end="00:10:23.829" style="s2">to sort of fall in line but wait but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.149" end="00:10:28.119" style="s2">can&#39;t coerce people right it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.829" end="00:10:34.929" style="s2">kind of attractive based on you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.119" end="00:10:37.600" style="s2">positive ideas but you know systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.929" end="00:10:38.799" style="s2">change is explicitly part of Bernie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.600" end="00:10:40.540" style="s2">platform through something like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.799" end="00:10:42.220" style="s2">green new deal and and many other things</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.540" end="00:10:44.169" style="s2">he said but I think it&#39;s also an</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">implicit factor and that it&#39;s open-ended</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.169" end="00:10:47.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s going to be reflexive and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:10:49.600" style="s2">going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.920" end="00:10:51.420" style="s2">you know we can have set plans for the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.600" end="00:10:54.250" style="s2">next decade but it&#39;s also going to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.420" end="00:10:57.490" style="s2">changeable and contingent and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.250" end="00:11:01.329" style="s2">were ostensibly all going to be involved</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.490" end="00:11:03.670" style="s2">in helping manage that process cuz it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.329" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">gonna take a decade right but I think I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.670" end="00:11:09.430" style="s2">think we&#39;re on on the cusp of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">decade right 2020 is coming up and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.430" end="00:11:13.930" style="s2">got to make the right decisions in all</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:17.260" style="s2">sectors right in in the political</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.930" end="00:11:21.209" style="s2">revolution in kind of changing social</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.260" end="00:11:24.070" style="s2">consciousness and environmentalism etc</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.209" end="00:11:25.720" style="s2">so I do think we need to get on the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.070" end="00:11:30.910" style="s2">page there quickly and that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.720" end="00:11:32.410" style="s2">five minutes myself awesome thanks Brent</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.910" end="00:11:36.040" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be taking five</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.410" end="00:11:38.649" style="s2">minutes but one of the reasons like this</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.040" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">is our third idea Cafe on game B and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.649" end="00:11:44.440" style="s2">we did talk about what our definition of</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:46.540" style="s2">game B was and why we want to game B and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.440" end="00:11:48.010" style="s2">so this is a bit weird of a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.540" end="00:11:50.709" style="s2">to have without actually I&#39;ve had to you</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.010" end="00:11:52.660" style="s2">having had that conversation but I also</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.709" end="00:11:55.000" style="s2">think that if we wait until we have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.660" end="00:12:00.070" style="s2">definitive we all agreed on what game B</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.000" end="00:12:02.050" style="s2">is to transition we don&#39;t we it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.070" end="00:12:04.810" style="s2">hard to agree on that especially when</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.050" end="00:12:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s this this we all live in game a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.810" end="00:12:07.990" style="s2">we&#39;re all in competition and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.640" end="00:12:10.360" style="s2">even know how the ways we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.990" end="00:12:13.140" style="s2">competing to know how to let that go to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.360" end="00:12:17.769" style="s2">create an omni win anti rival risk</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.140" end="00:12:20.709" style="s2">solution so to me my definition of game</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.769" end="00:12:22.420" style="s2">a is basically capitalism is this forced</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.709" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">sense of competition that you either</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:30.570" style="s2">participate in or you starve and so my</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:33.370" style="s2">definition of game B is a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.570" end="00:12:35.500" style="s2">organized cooperation system that runs</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.370" end="00:12:38.709" style="s2">parallel to the current one and does</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.500" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">transition us to game B by voluntary I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.709" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">mean every step along the way if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:43.540" style="s2">don&#39;t have a better food system than</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:44.680" style="s2">what game is offering you you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.540" end="00:12:46.570" style="s2">going to come on board for anything</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.680" end="00:12:49.540" style="s2">we&#39;re offering in the parallel system if</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.570" end="00:12:51.880" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a better technology our</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.540" end="00:12:54.120" style="s2">social network social media platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.880" end="00:12:56.110" style="s2">that you want to participate in in and</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.120" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">beyond you&#39;re going to be on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.110" end="00:12:59.800" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be on Twitter so every</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:01.630" style="s2">step along the way is voluntary do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.800" end="00:13:07.210" style="s2">want your data to be used in this way</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.630" end="00:13:10.170" style="s2">and organized is how we have our</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.210" end="00:13:12.040" style="s2">individual contributions without</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.170" end="00:13:15.100" style="s2">actually move us in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.040" end="00:13:17.110" style="s2">towards game-game be my solution the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.100" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">thing that I do think gets us to game be</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.110" end="00:13:23.350" style="s2">is a technology cooperative so we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:27.130" style="s2">all bringing together our our resources</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.350" end="00:13:29.950" style="s2">our money our passion our to move us in</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.130" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">one direction which never takes power</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.950" end="00:13:34.660" style="s2">over our individual lives but only gives</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:37.450" style="s2">us the tools to be able to have personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.660" end="00:13:40.120" style="s2">sovereignty how I think we control the</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.450" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">system as a whole together like politics</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.120" end="00:13:44.650" style="s2">and economics a little bit we ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:49.090" style="s2">before to create the tools about</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.650" end="00:13:51.580" style="s2">collaboration but then we information is</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.090" end="00:13:53.740" style="s2">so powerful that when you have trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.580" end="00:13:56.830" style="s2">where each trustworthy transparent</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.740" end="00:14:00.220" style="s2">information on our politicians they</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.830" end="00:14:02.020" style="s2">don&#39;t have the amount of overreaching</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.220" end="00:14:04.810" style="s2">power they currently have when you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.020" end="00:14:07.180" style="s2">see what they voted for in the past they</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.810" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">can&#39;t spin it right now the information</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.180" end="00:14:12.580" style="s2">so complex that it&#39;s understandable that</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:13.870" style="s2">people act like old fish or we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.580" end="00:14:15.370" style="s2">looking at the moment but when you can</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.870" end="00:14:17.650" style="s2">actually break it down and show people</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.370" end="00:14:20.200" style="s2">what in Bernie Sanders vote for in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.650" end="00:14:21.610" style="s2">past compared to Donald Trump who only</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.200" end="00:14:24.310" style="s2">has a track record for this to past</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.610" end="00:14:26.140" style="s2">three years but with economics if you</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.240" end="00:15:00.850" style="s2">all and so that to me is how we</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.840" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">transition to game B is to create the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.850" end="00:15:04.150" style="s2">tools to truly listen to each other and</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:05.830" style="s2">listen to what we need and not live it</p>

<p begin="00:15:15.010" end="00:15:17.950" style="s2">repercussions at the same time that</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.330" end="00:15:19.660" style="s2">we&#39;re going to create together and not</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.950" end="00:15:22.090" style="s2">ever leaving it up to a tiny group of</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.660" end="00:15:23.770" style="s2">people to have obscene amounts of</p>

<p begin="00:15:25.690" end="00:15:29.290" style="s2">like do you want to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.400" end="00:15:30.400" style="s2">creating the tools you get to come</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.290" end="00:15:31.810" style="s2">participate in creating tools if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.400" end="00:15:33.670" style="s2">just want to use the tools just use the</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.810" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">tools you get to choose how involved you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.670" end="00:15:39.760" style="s2">are and so that is how I think we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:43.030" style="s2">transition to gaming and now we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.760" end="00:15:43.900" style="s2">unmute everyone and have an open</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.030" end="00:15:47.740" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.900" end="00:15:49.660" style="s2">oh sorry David they were both try to</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.740" end="00:15:55.450" style="s2">unmute you I cannot meet you David maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.660" end="00:15:58.540" style="s2">only you kinam there you go um I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.450" end="00:16:00.300" style="s2">to start by just there are a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.540" end="00:16:02.890" style="s2">you just said I like they</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.300" end="00:16:05.830" style="s2">technologically based cooperative makes</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.890" end="00:16:08.430" style="s2">sense to me I also um I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.830" end="00:16:10.800" style="s2">extend it by thinking it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.430" end="00:16:13.120" style="s2">distributed and decentralized in</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.800" end="00:16:15.250" style="s2">holographic in nature meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.120" end="00:16:17.830" style="s2">practically sized to the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.250" end="00:16:19.390" style="s2">problems being solved in the community</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.830" end="00:16:21.490" style="s2">that solving it so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.390" end="00:16:25.390" style="s2">necessarily have to be universally</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.490" end="00:16:27.190" style="s2">applied across the entire spectrum of</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.390" end="00:16:28.900" style="s2">the of the cooperative in order for it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.190" end="00:16:31.540" style="s2">to be effective that one group wants to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.900" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2">try something and share what the results</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.540" end="00:16:35.620" style="s2">are that makes sense the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.220" end="00:16:37.630" style="s2">that I like about that approach is then</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.620" end="00:16:38.920" style="s2">we&#39;re not so much in competition if</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.630" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">somebody comes and says I want to join</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.920" end="00:16:42.460" style="s2">your coop but I want to do it this way</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:43.720" style="s2">is they actually you know the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.460" end="00:16:45.940" style="s2">where that&#39;s really being done is over</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.720" end="00:16:47.860" style="s2">here let&#39;s help you find the place</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.940" end="00:16:50.350" style="s2">that&#39;s most resonant with the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.860" end="00:16:53.050" style="s2">problems and the methods that you want</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.350" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">to achieve and get involved in that way</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.050" end="00:16:57.280" style="s2">and if you&#39;re finding it there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:58.630" style="s2">place that matches but let&#39;s check the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.280" end="00:17:00.880" style="s2">entire cooperative is there any are</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.630" end="00:17:03.640" style="s2">there other people who see this variant</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.880" end="00:17:05.380" style="s2">that&#39;s variation that we want to want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.640" end="00:17:10.470" style="s2">try something new so there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.380" end="00:17:10.470" style="s2">which it can more organically and</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.250" end="00:17:16.930" style="s2">responsibly deal with problems and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.380" end="00:17:20.650" style="s2">approaches rather than trying to deal</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.930" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">with it universally top-down so I like I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.650" end="00:17:26.470" style="s2">like that inertia and with that</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:29.320" style="s2">additional and the flavor of it mm-hmm I</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.470" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">do like the idea of a lot of the jisub</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.320" end="00:17:35.320" style="s2">platforms my issue with most of them is</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">they can&#39;t how they&#39;re currently being</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.320" end="00:17:39.309" style="s2">done they cannot out-compete game a</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:40.870" style="s2">because they&#39;re not accessible</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.309" end="00:17:42.549" style="s2">intellectually to most people they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.870" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">not except like I can&#39;t jump on board</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.549" end="00:17:45.820" style="s2">and be part of one of the whole chain</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:47.409" style="s2">projects without understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.820" end="00:17:49.059" style="s2">technology on a whole new level that I</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.409" end="00:17:51.340" style="s2">don&#39;t and they don&#39;t really want to hear</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.059" end="00:17:53.950" style="s2">that it&#39;s too complex like well sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.340" end="00:17:55.570" style="s2">like it&#39;s not that I like what you said</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.950" end="00:17:56.620" style="s2">when someone comes on board that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.570" end="00:17:57.730" style="s2">point it&#39;s like there&#39;s room for</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.620" end="00:17:59.649" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.730" end="00:18:01.539" style="s2">this is Omni win if you come on board</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.649" end="00:18:04.210" style="s2">and help us why wouldn&#39;t we want you</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.539" end="00:18:07.299" style="s2">there and so to be able to help everyone</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.210" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2">find their space is I think like one of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.299" end="00:18:11.879" style="s2">the huge goals of a technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:13.450" style="s2">cooperative including that yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.879" end="00:18:15.370" style="s2">decentralizing just to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.450" end="00:18:16.809" style="s2">decentralized and it&#39;s not centralizing</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.370" end="00:18:18.190" style="s2">just to centralize it it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.809" end="00:18:20.139" style="s2">makes the most sense right it makes</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.190" end="00:18:23.740" style="s2">sense to have one Facebook like entity</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.139" end="00:18:25.570" style="s2">that we&#39;re all on so we can like use</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.740" end="00:18:27.070" style="s2">that as the for the tools for everything</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.570" end="00:18:28.629" style="s2">else but it doesn&#39;t make sense if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.070" end="00:18:30.879" style="s2">gonna take away your autonomy right if</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.629" end="00:18:32.740" style="s2">you have to follow certain rules to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.879" end="00:18:34.029" style="s2">on there it&#39;s going to limit your free</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.740" end="00:18:35.649" style="s2">speech it&#39;s going to limit your access</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.029" end="00:18:37.629" style="s2">to information you&#39;re not gonna want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.649" end="00:18:40.379" style="s2">be there and so creating it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.629" end="00:18:43.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re listening to individuals but</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.379" end="00:18:45.220" style="s2">efficiently creating for the whole and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.000" end="00:18:47.110" style="s2">there&#39;ll be knitting stains that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.220" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">gonna be very powerful for small groups</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.110" end="00:18:52.169" style="s2">of people that are part of what we want</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:55.240" style="s2">to create together</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.169" end="00:18:56.320" style="s2">cani cani so sorry Ramsey you go ahead I</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.240" end="00:18:58.570" style="s2">was just gonna I&#39;m just gonna try and</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.320" end="00:19:01.450" style="s2">offer a little frame to continue the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.570" end="00:19:04.149" style="s2">discussion in yes I&#39;m I think we all we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.450" end="00:19:07.389" style="s2">all expressed a sort of inability or</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.149" end="00:19:10.210" style="s2">unwillingness or whatever to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.389" end="00:19:11.889" style="s2">exactly what game B is right and that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.210" end="00:19:14.409" style="s2">think it was David made the point that</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.889" end="00:19:15.580" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t map out a transition</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.409" end="00:19:17.019" style="s2">to something when you don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.580" end="00:19:18.070" style="s2">the thing is that you&#39;re transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.019" end="00:19:20.500" style="s2">towards when you&#39;d have a clearer idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.070" end="00:19:22.750" style="s2">with your transition sports and so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.500" end="00:19:24.639" style="s2">know get given that fact and honoring</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.750" end="00:19:25.929" style="s2">that fact right you know not trying well</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.639" end="00:19:27.220" style="s2">we have to come up with it we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.929" end="00:19:28.509" style="s2">come up with a definition right because</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.220" end="00:19:32.789" style="s2">we need a transition plan you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.509" end="00:19:35.049" style="s2">rather than that the idea of small-scale</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.789" end="00:19:36.580" style="s2">experimentation was was popping into my</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.049" end="00:19:38.039" style="s2">head on more than one occasion as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.580" end="00:19:40.990" style="s2">guys were speaking you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.039" end="00:19:42.250" style="s2">creating somehow and I&#39;m not I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.990" end="00:19:42.880" style="s2">have a clear picture of this but somehow</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.250" end="00:19:45.490" style="s2">or other</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.880" end="00:19:49.090" style="s2">creating a playing field and environment</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.490" end="00:19:50.620" style="s2">in which small-scale experiments because</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.090" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a billion ideas out there right</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.620" end="00:19:53.350" style="s2">I mean every day there&#39;s 20 new post</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:55.810" style="s2">people coming up with idea for this</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.350" end="00:19:58.330" style="s2">without the other right and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.810" end="00:20:00.190" style="s2">I I think a great way of managing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.330" end="00:20:03.340" style="s2">transition towards game B would be to</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.190" end="00:20:07.060" style="s2">create spaces in which experiments could</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.340" end="00:20:08.380" style="s2">be run on these things and that you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.060" end="00:20:10.510" style="s2">learning from the successes and failures</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.380" end="00:20:12.970" style="s2">of those experiments that what game B</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.510" end="00:20:15.190" style="s2">actually is going to become might also</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.970" end="00:20:17.170" style="s2">become clearer as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.190" end="00:20:19.270" style="s2">running those experiments you see what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.170" end="00:20:21.580" style="s2">mean and so the the map and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.270" end="00:20:23.590" style="s2">destination become clearer at the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.580" end="00:20:25.090" style="s2">time as you run the small experiments</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.590" end="00:20:27.790" style="s2">either does that sound like a reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.090" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">way you know in broad strokes of</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.790" end="00:20:37.210" style="s2">approaching it um I just wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">we don&#39;t have much historical context in</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.210" end="00:20:41.050" style="s2">which to look at you know revolutions or</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:43.180" style="s2">transitions in the past because let&#39;s be</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.050" end="00:20:45.070" style="s2">honest every single revolution or</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.180" end="00:20:48.430" style="s2">transition in the past has been from one</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.070" end="00:20:51.760" style="s2">game a to another so there is not much</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.430" end="00:20:54.790" style="s2">for us to look at there now if we can</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.760" end="00:20:57.730" style="s2">all agree at least for most of us here</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.790" end="00:21:00.430" style="s2">hopefully that the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.730" end="00:21:04.180" style="s2">defining feature of game a is it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.430" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">know the control and ownership of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.180" end="00:21:11.200" style="s2">resources for either asset appreciation</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.380" end="00:21:13.960" style="s2">or asked you know or value extraction</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.200" end="00:21:16.510" style="s2">and so with that particular game of</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.960" end="00:21:18.970" style="s2">people owning things so they can either</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.510" end="00:21:20.920" style="s2">hoard them so that they can increase in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.970" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">value or to extract the value from the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.920" end="00:21:28.360" style="s2">resources by combining resources and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:30.910" style="s2">labor etc that&#39;s game a so whatever game</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.360" end="00:21:33.430" style="s2">B that we propose if you&#39;re playing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.910" end="00:21:36.040" style="s2">same game then it&#39;s still game a so this</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.430" end="00:21:38.920" style="s2">is why what I&#39;m saying is is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.040" end="00:21:41.260" style="s2">have a clear understanding of who owns</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.920" end="00:21:42.790" style="s2">what because if at any transition from</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.260" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">the past in the country which I was born</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.790" end="00:21:46.210" style="s2">they went through multiple transitions</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:48.340" style="s2">essentially they were all from game a a</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.210" end="00:21:51.160" style="s2">game a of course but they redefined</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.340" end="00:21:53.650" style="s2">slightly that the rules and who owned</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.160" end="00:21:56.860" style="s2">what and so they redistributed a</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.650" end="00:21:58.659" style="s2">reallocated resources land etc</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.860" end="00:22:00.909" style="s2">it divided the land amongst all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.659" end="00:22:03.039" style="s2">villagers and communities and so they</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.909" end="00:22:05.380" style="s2">did that we don&#39;t we don&#39;t we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.039" end="00:22:09.100" style="s2">that again today by the way on a global</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.380" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">level because we don&#39;t have equal access</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.100" end="00:22:14.049" style="s2">to actual physical resources and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:15.659" style="s2">fake resources called money so clearly</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.049" end="00:22:18.850" style="s2">there needs to be some type of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.659" end="00:22:21.370" style="s2">property redistribution and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.850" end="00:22:24.010" style="s2">understanding of who&#39;s gonna own what</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.370" end="00:22:25.990" style="s2">but not necessarily own it per se but</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.010" end="00:22:27.490" style="s2">essentially be caretaker of it because</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.990" end="00:22:29.380" style="s2">remember we don&#39;t want to play the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.490" end="00:22:32.019" style="s2">game as game a we don&#39;t want to own</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.380" end="00:22:34.600" style="s2">things and hold resources control</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.019" end="00:22:36.850" style="s2">resources access them for the purposes</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.600" end="00:22:39.549" style="s2">of trying to act like you know create</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.850" end="00:22:41.529" style="s2">maximum value it should be different</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.549" end="00:22:43.240" style="s2">game there so should be for value</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.529" end="00:22:45.519" style="s2">creation like what Jubilees mentioning</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.240" end="00:22:47.529" style="s2">rather than if they value extraction so</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.519" end="00:22:49.419" style="s2">that would require a different type of</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.529" end="00:22:53.889" style="s2">economics to incentivize that game as</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.419" end="00:22:55.630" style="s2">well but to Julie&#39;s point you know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.889" end="00:22:57.490" style="s2">believe it can be done there was a group</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.630" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">of people you know in the technocracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.490" end="00:23:02.409" style="s2">movement who started that over a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:05.500" style="s2">years ago and who are the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.409" end="00:23:07.899" style="s2">you know thinking we can organize these</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.500" end="00:23:09.399" style="s2">things using technology and new</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.899" end="00:23:13.179" style="s2">applications but they just didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.399" end="00:23:15.340" style="s2">the full technology tool that we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.179" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">today to be able to I think develop</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.340" end="00:23:22.419" style="s2">further their ideas but the transition I</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:23.350" style="s2">believe is going to be to a game be has</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.419" end="00:23:24.700" style="s2">to be peaceful</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.350" end="00:23:27.130" style="s2">they can&#39;t it&#39;s not going to be by</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.700" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">competing our competing game a but</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.130" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">rather attracting people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.010" style="s2">play the new game versus the shit game</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:37.960" style="s2">that we&#39;re playing now so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.010" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">going to be more of an attractor that</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.960" end="00:23:41.529" style="s2">whereas here&#39;s the technology here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:43.570" style="s2">tools here&#39;s the game that we would like</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.529" end="00:23:46.090" style="s2">to play you know do you want to play</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.570" end="00:23:48.610" style="s2">with us you know you can become a member</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.090" end="00:23:51.100" style="s2">whatever and then we can develop develop</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.610" end="00:23:52.389" style="s2">that transition etc so that&#39;s how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.100" end="00:23:54.460" style="s2">imagining the transition I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.389" end="00:23:56.889" style="s2">going to take time for more of us to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.460" end="00:23:59.049" style="s2">develop it but it&#39;s gonna come piecemeal</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.889" end="00:24:01.630" style="s2">once the tools become more readily</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.049" end="00:24:03.460" style="s2">available and more people are engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.630" end="00:24:06.190" style="s2">this discussion I think things will</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.460" end="00:24:08.409" style="s2">become more crystallized will begin to</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.190" end="00:24:10.550" style="s2">you know to input the data for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.409" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">property and for the resources</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.550" end="00:24:15.830" style="s2">so we have those tools in place and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:17.090" style="s2">understanding of who owns what but then</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.830" end="00:24:19.370" style="s2">we can change the game</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.090" end="00:24:21.650" style="s2">I like your leg which is much more</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.370" end="00:24:23.510" style="s2">diplomatic when I say out-compete I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.650" end="00:24:25.790" style="s2">that I mean creating an attractor that</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.510" end="00:24:27.980" style="s2">is so attractive that people have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.790" end="00:24:30.020" style="s2">choice for every individual project</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.980" end="00:24:32.090" style="s2">product service community do you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.020" end="00:24:33.380" style="s2">game a or do you want game B right or</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:36.320" style="s2">this parallel system that is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.380" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">transition game B and then they if if</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.320" end="00:24:39.170" style="s2">it&#39;s better for them as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna choose game B and</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.170" end="00:24:42.980" style="s2">eventually if there&#39;s no one else</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">playing game a it out completes it it</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.980" end="00:24:47.510" style="s2">does it does take it away I don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:49.550" style="s2">about the resources that that is game B</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.510" end="00:24:52.700" style="s2">I don&#39;t necessarily agree that that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.550" end="00:24:55.760" style="s2">how we transition because those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.700" end="00:24:59.360" style="s2">are already owned by people and anytime</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.760" end="00:25:00.710" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a is the communist part</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.360" end="00:25:02.380" style="s2">of like going in and taking over the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.710" end="00:25:04.700" style="s2">means of production I the the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.380" end="00:25:06.440" style="s2">information piece I absolutely agree</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.700" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">with just having that information about</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.440" end="00:25:10.130" style="s2">who owned leaves what and how it is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:12.410" style="s2">moves around the globe is very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.130" end="00:25:15.050" style="s2">and that is the kind of thing we can</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.410" end="00:25:17.420" style="s2">create now with technology that helps us</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.050" end="00:25:18.890" style="s2">figure that piece out but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.420" end="00:25:20.870" style="s2">we just switch over to a new system</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.890" end="00:25:23.270" style="s2">because it&#39;s not playing the small</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.870" end="00:25:25.430" style="s2">experiments it&#39;s it&#39;s it can be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.270" end="00:25:27.800" style="s2">catastrophic failure on a massive scale</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.430" end="00:25:29.750" style="s2">if we just have all the sudden even if</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.800" end="00:25:31.940" style="s2">it&#39;s utopia and this brand-new system</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.750" end="00:25:33.980" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know all of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.940" end="00:25:37.100" style="s2">that we as individuals play in that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.980" end="00:25:40.310" style="s2">system creating it piecemeal where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.100" end="00:25:43.010" style="s2">um you know did we create a better a</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.310" end="00:25:45.860" style="s2">better coca-cola did we create a better</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.010" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">Facebook did we create is that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.860" end="00:25:50.390" style="s2">answers in did people choose it over the</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:52.220" style="s2">other one or is there something more</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.390" end="00:25:54.050" style="s2">offering them and then when we offer</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.220" end="00:25:57.110" style="s2">them the tools for massive collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.050" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">I think people a lot of people not</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.110" end="00:26:00.560" style="s2">everyone but a lot of people choose to</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.870" style="s2">come and collaborate they choose to come</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.560" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">and give their passion and energy to</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.870" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">something they can see has a hope in</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:09.890" style="s2">creating a better world for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:12.940" style="s2">for their communities for the world and</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.890" end="00:26:15.200" style="s2">the more we offer that the better and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.940" end="00:26:17.870" style="s2">that&#39;s how we get charged with it</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.200" end="00:26:19.520" style="s2">resources eventually so I think one of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.870" end="00:26:21.950" style="s2">the things that&#39;s important is looking</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.520" end="00:26:23.640" style="s2">at the way that that we approach this in</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.950" end="00:26:26.940" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.640" end="00:26:29.549" style="s2">yes and approach so what I heard you say</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.940" end="00:26:30.900" style="s2">Julie sounded like it was in contrast to</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.900" end="00:26:35.700" style="s2">necessarily need to be isn&#39;t property</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.210" end="00:26:37.740" style="s2">property redistribution can be done on a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.700" end="00:26:38.309" style="s2">gradual practical basis rather than all</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.740" end="00:26:40.940" style="s2">at once</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.309" end="00:26:42.750" style="s2">it&#39;s not a matter of saying okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.940" end="00:26:45.929" style="s2">unfinished we&#39;re gonna change to this</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.750" end="00:26:47.580" style="s2">model its people I have property I can I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.929" end="00:26:49.920" style="s2">can join that and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.580" end="00:26:52.830" style="s2">bring that in and the distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.920" end="00:26:54.030" style="s2">that and how does that work out and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.830" end="00:26:56.429" style="s2">think that it&#39;s there&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.030" end="00:26:58.590" style="s2">notion of this that the visual that</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.429" end="00:27:01.910" style="s2">comes to mind for me is the difference</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.590" end="00:27:03.570" style="s2">from moving from marching band type</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.910" end="00:27:06.630" style="s2">commanded control</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.570" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">let&#39;s do this in a structured way to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.630" end="00:27:12.179" style="s2">murmuration of starlings you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:16.470" style="s2">flocking and flowing together that kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.179" end="00:27:18.750" style="s2">of behavior really requires very high</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.470" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">levels of attunement individually in</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.750" end="00:27:22.890" style="s2">feedback systems within the group to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:24.120" style="s2">kind of what&#39;s happening we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.890" end="00:27:26.280" style="s2">able to have that kind of thing to give</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.120" end="00:27:27.929" style="s2">them to do that and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.280" end="00:27:29.520" style="s2">gonna be able to do a switch overall</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.929" end="00:27:32.970" style="s2">from one to the other but small</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.520" end="00:27:34.620" style="s2">experiments of that kind of flocking can</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.970" end="00:27:36.120" style="s2">then grow and you can sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.620" end="00:27:37.590" style="s2">because different experiments are</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.120" end="00:27:39.990" style="s2">working differently as we&#39;re sharing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.590" end="00:27:41.700" style="s2">information with each other I think that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.990" end="00:27:43.590" style="s2">that part that&#39;s that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.700" end="00:27:45.299" style="s2">interesting is thinking about changing</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.590" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">the notion of the way that intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.299" end="00:27:50.520" style="s2">property and privacy works I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:53.790" style="s2">that again that that&#39;s an overall thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.520" end="00:27:56.940" style="s2">everywhere but that one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.790" end="00:28:00.240" style="s2">things that I think game G practitioners</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.940" end="00:28:02.010" style="s2">are engaged in is what are these methods</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.240" end="00:28:03.390" style="s2">and models that work on and more</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.010" end="00:28:05.700" style="s2">feedback on this kind of a feedback</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.390" end="00:28:07.440" style="s2">method that allow us to fly is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.700" end="00:28:08.850" style="s2">working is it working over here is it</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:12.120" style="s2">not looking over there why is it not</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.850" end="00:28:14.130" style="s2">just really noticing the kinds of things</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.120" end="00:28:19.020" style="s2">that work experimenting that and being</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.130" end="00:28:20.669" style="s2">able to flesh it out and throw it thank</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.020" end="00:28:22.140" style="s2">you David I&#39;d love that especially I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.669" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">just going to talk about 30 seconds that</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.140" end="00:28:27.900" style="s2">the that I&#39;m saying know as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:29.220" style="s2">yes end and that end of itself is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.900" end="00:28:32.250" style="s2">flock because it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.220" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">instantaneous feedback on that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.250" end="00:28:36.860" style="s2">versus allowing that to continue or I</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:38.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.860" end="00:28:41.420" style="s2">I just wanted to say thank you and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.960" end="00:28:43.820" style="s2">yes yes and yes let&#39;s get resources and</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.420" end="00:28:47.960" style="s2">control and create the technology and do</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.820" end="00:28:50.020" style="s2">it all yep can I also say as well source</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.960" end="00:28:52.280" style="s2">also climb back to something David said</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.020" end="00:28:54.440" style="s2">very very much in line with my own</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.280" end="00:28:59.600" style="s2">thinking on this that things like rule</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.440" end="00:29:01.309" style="s2">Omega R that is that&#39;s kind of game B</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.600" end="00:29:03.170" style="s2">essence right there right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.309" end="00:29:05.600" style="s2">holy water of game B because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.170" end="00:29:09.650" style="s2">that&#39;s not it&#39;s not a thing it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">structure it&#39;s not a set of well it kind</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.650" end="00:29:14.750" style="s2">of is a set of rules but it&#39;s not rules</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:19.669" style="s2">in that sense it&#39;s it&#39;s a methodology by</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.750" end="00:29:22.870" style="s2">which one can more fully utilize the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.669" end="00:29:25.280" style="s2">resources available to come to better</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.870" end="00:29:28.309" style="s2">decisions better perspectives whatever</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.280" end="00:29:30.380" style="s2">and so that kind of meta the development</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.309" end="00:29:33.140" style="s2">of those meta type protocols that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.380" end="00:29:36.140" style="s2">another powerful transitional tool right</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.140" end="00:29:38.510" style="s2">because you know the game the new game</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.140" end="00:29:40.309" style="s2">will emerge from things like that right</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.510" end="00:29:43.340" style="s2">without needing to define what it is it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.309" end="00:29:45.049" style="s2">will emerge naturally by a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.340" end="00:29:47.660" style="s2">number of people embodying things like</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.049" end="00:29:50.990" style="s2">that so again I think it&#39;s a another</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.660" end="00:29:52.340" style="s2">powerful transitional idea any any idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.990" end="00:29:54.770" style="s2">don&#39;t offend you can think of any other</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.340" end="00:29:57.799" style="s2">examples rule Omega is top of my list</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.770" end="00:29:59.090" style="s2">certainly MVC has a lot of I was talking</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.799" end="00:30:00.710" style="s2">to Roland is I don&#39;t know if any of you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.090" end="00:30:03.290" style="s2">had any interaction with Roland Eze I</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.710" end="00:30:05.660" style="s2">was talking to him about rule Omega and</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.290" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">MVC and he&#39;s really into MVC and he was</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.660" end="00:30:09.049" style="s2">going through some of the principles and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.700" style="s2">some of the ideas and they&#39;re very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.049" end="00:30:13.309" style="s2">very closely aligned I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.700" end="00:30:17.059" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely bridges to to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.309" end="00:30:18.890" style="s2">built between the communities there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.059" end="00:30:21.260" style="s2">I had a brief interaction with Roland as</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.890" end="00:30:23.570" style="s2">he was on one of these the Communist</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.260" end="00:30:25.220" style="s2">Marxism one and also Hugh I had</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.570" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">mentioned yes I&#39;ve heard of non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.220" end="00:30:29.030" style="s2">communication but basically that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:32.179" style="s2">just watched an hour-long</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.030" end="00:30:33.710" style="s2">talk twice the same the same talk a few</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.179" end="00:30:35.480" style="s2">months apart and I think you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.710" end="00:30:36.730" style="s2">that there is a lot of non-violent</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.480" end="00:30:39.650" style="s2">communication is about getting</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.730" end="00:30:41.870" style="s2">everybody&#39;s needs met and if it feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.650" end="00:30:43.160" style="s2">like we&#39;re in conflict there&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.870" end="00:30:45.380" style="s2">a way we can get our needs met and if</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.160" end="00:30:47.750" style="s2">we&#39;re bypassing someone&#39;s needs that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.380" end="00:30:50.600" style="s2">never good like it always has negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.750" end="00:30:52.460" style="s2">consequences even if it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.600" end="00:30:55.070" style="s2">datta&#39;s polite or what is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.460" end="00:30:56.990" style="s2">done in society it has an underlining</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.070" end="00:30:58.460" style="s2">consequence that when people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.990" end="00:31:00.410" style="s2">boundaries are crossed and their needs</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.460" end="00:31:03.260" style="s2">aren&#39;t being met that we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.410" end="00:31:06.200" style="s2">to figure figure out and that and rule</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.260" end="00:31:09.080" style="s2">Omega I think are kind of the the dance</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.200" end="00:31:11.570" style="s2">of game of game B and figuring that out</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.080" end="00:31:14.539" style="s2">personally of like okay how do I yes and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:17.059" style="s2">and how do i how do we create how do we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.539" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">have everyone working in their direction</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.059" end="00:31:21.860" style="s2">of what they think the next step is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:25.340" style="s2">having it lead somewhere as a whole that</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.860" end="00:31:28.340" style="s2">it gets us somewhere do you guys think</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.340" end="00:31:31.700" style="s2">that the transition would be more</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.340" end="00:31:35.480" style="s2">difficult or easier if we have an</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.700" end="00:31:36.860" style="s2">upcoming economic chaos I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.480" end="00:31:38.809" style="s2">suggesting collapse or depression</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.860" end="00:31:42.070" style="s2">because that takes time but what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.809" end="00:31:44.929" style="s2">thinking is going to happen next year is</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.070" end="00:31:47.419" style="s2">probably going to be volatility in terms</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.929" end="00:31:50.299" style="s2">of asset fluctuations of the stock</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.419" end="00:31:52.730" style="s2">markets of other commodities of</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.299" end="00:31:55.730" style="s2">currencies etc which is going to cause</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.730" end="00:31:58.309" style="s2">disruptions in and of course to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.730" end="00:32:00.049" style="s2">and bankruptcies for certain industries</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.309" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">and corporations etc because</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.049" end="00:32:05.210" style="s2">corporations in you know can&#39;t handle</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:08.299" style="s2">uncertainty they need to have constant</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.210" end="00:32:11.960" style="s2">cash flow etc so when when we if we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.299" end="00:32:14.179" style="s2">a economic chaos coming up is it going</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.960" end="00:32:16.309" style="s2">to be easier for us to transition is</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.179" end="00:32:18.380" style="s2">that going to make it assuming that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.309" end="00:32:20.690" style="s2">have a game B plan of course it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.380" end="00:32:23.780" style="s2">motion or is it going to make it more</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.690" end="00:32:27.830" style="s2">difficult and lead us towards some kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.780" end="00:32:31.130" style="s2">of authoritarian fascist you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.830" end="00:32:33.799" style="s2">martial law shit so either way</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.130" end="00:32:35.809" style="s2">absolutely could go either way on it and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.799" end="00:32:38.750" style="s2">I think it depends in part on the way of</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.809" end="00:32:41.390" style="s2">transitions and I want to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.750" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">briefly and then I&#39;d like to ask Brent</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.390" end="00:32:50.030" style="s2">the way in so what I&#39;ll say is I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:52.070" style="s2">that if we prepare for that with an</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.030" end="00:32:55.970" style="s2">awareness of what sorts of transitions</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.070" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">are possible like at the moment of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.970" end="00:33:00.409" style="s2">starting to get the kind of feedback of</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.570" end="00:33:06.019" style="s2">and if so what are these responses</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.429" end="00:33:08.149" style="s2">the correction of the work while doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.019" end="00:33:10.249" style="s2">some sort of initial thought pending</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.149" end="00:33:11.720" style="s2">before it happens will be easier than</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.249" end="00:33:14.659" style="s2">saying oh that collapse that we happen</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.720" end="00:33:16.639" style="s2">to have a tragedy right now you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.659" end="00:33:18.950" style="s2">way that I like to dig about this is it</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.129" end="00:33:25.309" style="s2">road gets icy that&#39;s not the time to</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.309" end="00:33:29.779" style="s2">look at the map and see which way is the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.809" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">best way to go that&#39;s really no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.779" end="00:33:32.899" style="s2">no time for planning at that point the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:35.629" style="s2">time for looking at what does the</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.899" end="00:33:39.080" style="s2">landscape what are our possible avenues</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.629" end="00:33:41.299" style="s2">for development is now when things are</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.080" end="00:33:44.450" style="s2">relatively calm then as it unrolls let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.299" end="00:33:46.369" style="s2">really revisit than update America but I</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.450" end="00:33:48.679" style="s2">wanted to take it to you Brenda</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.369" end="00:33:51.830" style="s2">specifically because it seems that your</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.679" end="00:33:54.049" style="s2">initial statement was the most distinct</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.830" end="00:33:56.330" style="s2">from the kind of collective view in</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.049" end="00:33:58.009" style="s2">terms of going towards Bernie Sanders as</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.330" end="00:34:00.139" style="s2">the independent and looking into quickly</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.009" end="00:34:01.700" style="s2">I&#39;m curious what you&#39;ve heard so far and</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.139" end="00:34:05.990" style="s2">kind of specifically what rooms he said</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.700" end="00:34:09.500" style="s2">how where are you now yeah based on that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.990" end="00:34:12.319" style="s2">last question first I think you know we</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.500" end="00:34:14.619" style="s2">can&#39;t predict what the economy is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.319" end="00:34:17.780" style="s2">do in that sense and it it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.619" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter in terms of our you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.780" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">decision matrix because like for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:23.450" style="s2">clear what policies we should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:25.339" style="s2">supporting you know things like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.450" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">green New Deal and like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.339" end="00:34:30.200" style="s2">something called simple simultaneous</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:35.359" style="s2">policy and that&#39;s a kind of coordination</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.200" end="00:34:37.669" style="s2">effort for international convergence on</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.359" end="00:34:40.700" style="s2">on on policies could have a new level of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.669" end="00:34:42.799" style="s2">meta governance and and like I said with</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:45.530" style="s2">all the systems transition literature</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.799" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">like a lot of it is spelled out in quite</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.530" end="00:34:50.599" style="s2">clear detail like where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">where we need to go and how to get there</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.599" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">and where we&#39;re headed if we don&#39;t so as</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:35:00.559" style="s2">for the economic crisis or depression or</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.299" style="s2">whatever it may be like that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.559" end="00:35:06.740" style="s2">affect different people differently of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.299" end="00:35:09.260" style="s2">course it&#39;s not really a cause for</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.740" end="00:35:11.240" style="s2">concern is for us if the corporation</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.260" end="00:35:13.099" style="s2">goes out of business if that&#39;s what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.240" end="00:35:16.280" style="s2">destined to do you know we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.099" end="00:35:18.160" style="s2">bailing out banks for example right you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.280" end="00:35:20.859" style="s2">know instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.160" end="00:35:22.569" style="s2">putting that money to better use the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.859" end="00:35:26.589" style="s2">other general comment that would make is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.569" end="00:35:32.319" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this kind of sentiment</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.589" end="00:35:33.730" style="s2">and mmm interest in bottom-up organizing</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.319" end="00:35:37.150" style="s2">and experimenting and that&#39;s super</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.730" end="00:35:39.339" style="s2">important but I would say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.150" end="00:35:42.160" style="s2">society itself is an experiment and it</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.339" end="00:35:45.460" style="s2">contains tons of social experiments</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.160" end="00:35:48.730" style="s2">every type of Association is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.460" end="00:35:51.599" style="s2">form of collective intelligence and has</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.730" end="00:35:56.140" style="s2">some purpose to effect some change of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.599" end="00:35:57.130" style="s2">the landscape and so over the past</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.140" end="00:35:59.470" style="s2">century there&#39;s been a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.130" end="00:36:02.380" style="s2">experimentation in in this progressive</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.470" end="00:36:04.829" style="s2">vein right with with with things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.380" end="00:36:08.230" style="s2">communes and I always think back to this</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.829" end="00:36:10.180" style="s2">documentary all watched over by machines</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.230" end="00:36:11.710" style="s2">of loving grace it&#39;s Adam Curtis</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.180" end="00:36:14.140" style="s2">documentary and it&#39;s about basically</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.710" end="00:36:16.720" style="s2">these intentional communities and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.140" end="00:36:18.819" style="s2">communes of the of the 70s that really</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.720" end="00:36:20.530" style="s2">have the right progressive ideas but</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.819" end="00:36:23.230" style="s2">ultimately a lot of them fell apart</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.530" end="00:36:25.720" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t adequately any</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.230" end="00:36:27.309" style="s2">factor in power as part of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.720" end="00:36:30.450" style="s2">right so they were attempting to set up</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.309" end="00:36:34.359" style="s2">a kind of game B system but it still was</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.450" end="00:36:37.859" style="s2">subject to realism and and and various</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.359" end="00:36:40.299" style="s2">dynamics that threaten the integrity of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.859" end="00:36:42.940" style="s2">a progressive steady state so we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.299" end="00:36:45.190" style="s2">these lessons from the past and not</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.940" end="00:36:46.930" style="s2">every lesson is clear like why it failed</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.190" end="00:36:49.960" style="s2">right sometimes it&#39;s just an example of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.930" end="00:36:52.210" style="s2">capitalism crushing a kind of democratic</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.960" end="00:36:53.710" style="s2">socialist experiment somewhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.210" end="00:36:57.579" style="s2">world like like all over Latin America</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.710" end="00:36:59.380" style="s2">for example um so we&#39;ve we can learn a</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.579" end="00:37:00.970" style="s2">lot from that but my final point would</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.380" end="00:37:05.500" style="s2">be that you know all this bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.970" end="00:37:08.859" style="s2">organizing and you know heuristics for</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.500" end="00:37:11.289" style="s2">for for a positive interaction and</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.859" end="00:37:13.059" style="s2">whatnot non-religious dynamics it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.289" end="00:37:14.799" style="s2">worth anything if it&#39;s not coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.059" end="00:37:16.869" style="s2">with the top-down change as well and</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.799" end="00:37:20.170" style="s2">there&#39;s so much happening at the top</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.869" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">right with elite factionalism and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.170" end="00:37:23.619" style="s2">just a lot a lot of things shift you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:27.569" style="s2">know a lot a lot more prominent people</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.619" end="00:37:31.210" style="s2">coming public with critiques of elite</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.569" end="00:37:31.869" style="s2">finance and philanthropy we need you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.210" end="00:37:34.450" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.869" end="00:37:36.039" style="s2">eat people need to get real about what</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.450" end="00:37:38.200" style="s2">their what their negative impact has</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.039" end="00:37:39.700" style="s2">been and how they can affect a positive</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.200" end="00:37:43.029" style="s2">future and so the bottom up in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.700" end="00:37:46.930" style="s2">talked about organizing and change has</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.029" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">to be coordinated or else or else it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.930" end="00:37:50.769" style="s2">all for nothing right because if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:52.450" style="s2">have a bunch of enthusiastic bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.769" end="00:37:54.009" style="s2">people that themselves get into power</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.450" end="00:37:56.349" style="s2">and don&#39;t know what to do it&#39;ll fall</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.009" end="00:37:58.690" style="s2">apart and and vice versa if you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.349" end="00:38:01.690" style="s2">elites manipulating the masses you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.690" end="00:38:03.849" style="s2">so someone like you know people judge</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.690" end="00:38:05.799" style="s2">becomes president by chance and it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.849" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">know he&#39;s not the progressive people</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.799" end="00:38:07.720" style="s2">thought he was it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:09.519" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.720" end="00:38:12.670" style="s2">so you need that alignment and</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.519" end="00:38:16.119" style="s2">convergence between what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.670" end="00:38:18.430" style="s2">with bottom-up organizing and what what</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.119" end="00:38:20.890" style="s2">the top-down potential for change has</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.430" end="00:38:22.749" style="s2">been converging towards for the past 50</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.890" end="00:38:25.410" style="s2">years like the potential tipping point</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.749" end="00:38:27.819" style="s2">right because the the paradigm were in</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.410" end="00:38:30.369" style="s2">getting more specific than gaming right</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.819" end="00:38:34.390" style="s2">the last 4050 years its characterized by</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.369" end="00:38:36.119" style="s2">neoliberalism in a very distinct way and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.390" end="00:38:41.220" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s built-in</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.119" end="00:38:47.170" style="s2">rules to that game that that undermine</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.220" end="00:38:50.739" style="s2">progress and gain the protocols right so</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.170" end="00:38:55.019" style="s2">that that needs to change to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.739" end="00:38:56.980" style="s2">something more common space but without</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.019" end="00:38:59.880" style="s2">you know there&#39;s something more close</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.980" end="00:39:03.460" style="s2">capitalist but without completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.880" end="00:39:06.359" style="s2">appending the you know without</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.460" end="00:39:09.190" style="s2">collectivizing people&#39;s private</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.359" end="00:39:16.900" style="s2">resources right it needs to be adjusted</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.190" end="00:39:18.190" style="s2">and written I mean I like a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.900" end="00:39:20.920" style="s2">and there&#39;s some there&#39;s some parts that</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.190" end="00:39:22.930" style="s2">um that I would tweak one one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.920" end="00:39:24.880" style="s2">I hear in that that I that I don&#39;t agree</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.930" end="00:39:28.180" style="s2">with that I&#39;d like to look at a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.880" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">detail is the way in which the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.180" end="00:39:34.440" style="s2">and the top-down court in some way I</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:39.339" style="s2">don&#39;t think because the bottom up</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.440" end="00:39:42.970" style="s2">effectively is if we consider can be</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.339" end="00:39:44.890" style="s2">primarily coming from bottom-up it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.970" end="00:39:45.520" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have enough power and authority</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.890" end="00:39:47.830" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.520" end="00:39:50.530" style="s2">really get the interest of the of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.830" end="00:39:53.650" style="s2">elites and in some way I think more like</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.530" end="00:39:55.900" style="s2">loving or hating Elon Musk has done</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.650" end="00:39:59.890" style="s2">something in terms of moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.900" end="00:40:02.260" style="s2">electric cars which is an emo no way is</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.890" end="00:40:04.450" style="s2">there anybody going to say yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.260" end="00:40:06.100" style="s2">find a system that way a governmental</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.450" end="00:40:07.840" style="s2">way of doing that he&#39;s just doing a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.100" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">free-market way I&#39;m going to move in</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.840" end="00:40:12.520" style="s2">this direction and he&#39;s starting to move</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.930" style="s2">the needle on his own yeah that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.520" end="00:40:15.490" style="s2">thing but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.930" end="00:40:18.210" style="s2">true that it&#39;s only going to come from</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.490" end="00:40:20.530" style="s2">private innovation like it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.210" end="00:40:23.140" style="s2">calm you know public knowledge to some</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.530" end="00:40:25.750" style="s2">extent that that industry has been you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.140" end="00:40:29.170" style="s2">know actively suppressed and held back</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.750" end="00:40:33.160" style="s2">and in the u.s. especially there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.170" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">a lot of like like lack of a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.160" end="00:40:36.310" style="s2">governance right so they could have</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:39.340" style="s2">chosen to an actually government plays a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.310" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">really important role in this idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.340" end="00:40:43.750" style="s2">big push economically of changing</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">systems they just haven&#39;t done it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.750" end="00:40:49.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that we have to and should</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.960" end="00:40:52.600" style="s2">leave it to people like Elon Musk right</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.360" end="00:40:54.850" style="s2">yeah so I agree I think and that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.600" end="00:40:57.340" style="s2">of the point is Elon Musk didn&#39;t wait</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.850" end="00:40:59.170" style="s2">for right but the progressive push from</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.340" end="00:41:00.760" style="s2">above is like a you know forget it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.170" end="00:41:02.770" style="s2">just gonna go and not everybody can do</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.760" end="00:41:05.100" style="s2">that so there is both but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.770" end="00:41:08.530" style="s2">require that that&#39;s the starting point</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.100" end="00:41:09.970" style="s2">there&#39;s also a notion that I have but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.530" end="00:41:12.090" style="s2">heard somebody say and actually it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.970" end="00:41:14.140" style="s2">first to make more sense but it seemed</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.090" end="00:41:16.960" style="s2">nonsensical at first</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.140" end="00:41:19.120" style="s2">somebody said collapse early avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:21.610" style="s2">rush you know we&#39;re already heading</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.120" end="00:41:24.640" style="s2">there finding people that&#39;s sort of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.610" end="00:41:28.930" style="s2">sense of the starting of a game the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.640" end="00:41:30.280" style="s2">network cooperative experiment let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.930" end="00:41:31.780" style="s2">this you know the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.280" end="00:41:33.780" style="s2">interested in really committed and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.780" end="00:41:36.300" style="s2">finding a way to do that don&#39;t wait for</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.780" end="00:41:38.350" style="s2">somebody else to give permission</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.300" end="00:41:39.910" style="s2">demonstrate that it works and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.350" end="00:41:44.440" style="s2">started acting more interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.910" end="00:41:46.690" style="s2">way but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.440" end="00:41:48.820" style="s2">kind of initiative how to do that how to</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.690" end="00:41:54.520" style="s2">do sort of collective decision-making</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.820" end="00:41:58.070" style="s2">that isn&#39;t I&#39;d like to add one more</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.520" end="00:41:59.750" style="s2">thing is oh no this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.070" end="00:42:01.640" style="s2">being a little bit more complicated a</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.750" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">model that I think that was the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.640" end="00:42:06.200" style="s2">the neurons work in a brain it really is</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">that fractal holographics since making</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.200" end="00:42:11.300" style="s2">apparatus and rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:15.020" style="s2">think of you don&#39;t have every neuron</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.300" end="00:42:18.010" style="s2">coding on every decision each neuron has</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.020" end="00:42:20.960" style="s2">a very specific very tuned way of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.010" end="00:42:22.850" style="s2">thinking you know caring about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.960" end="00:42:28.570" style="s2">going on with it&#39;s 10,000 connections</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.850" end="00:42:30.620" style="s2">and very it&#39;s a very tightly managed</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.570" end="00:42:33.340" style="s2">internal sense making or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.620" end="00:42:36.830" style="s2">important it&#39;s not based on a higher</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.340" end="00:42:40.190" style="s2">view of propositional notions it really</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.830" end="00:42:42.710" style="s2">is a and some level such a local</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.190" end="00:42:46.010" style="s2">decision that it&#39;s nuanced by something</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.710" end="00:42:48.320" style="s2">very minor and then it&#39;s aggregated in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.010" end="00:42:50.660" style="s2">way that gives the sense of where what</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.320" end="00:42:53.090" style="s2">is where is the sense in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.660" end="00:42:55.490" style="s2">so there&#39;s something that I I think that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.090" end="00:42:59.390" style="s2">we can develop things like that neural</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.490" end="00:43:01.820" style="s2">net infrastructure is similar to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.390" end="00:43:03.950" style="s2">and I think that we can really do</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.820" end="00:43:06.140" style="s2">something to allow human beings to see</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.950" end="00:43:08.780" style="s2">that and really hone what is your</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.140" end="00:43:11.510" style="s2">specific flavor that you care about and</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.780" end="00:43:13.370" style="s2">how is that reacting to your your local</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.510" end="00:43:15.080" style="s2">and then the global sense right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.370" end="00:43:17.780" style="s2">there&#39;s some interesting models there</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.080" end="00:43:19.700" style="s2">but I think that are interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.780" end="00:43:22.360" style="s2">start moving in the direction of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.700" end="00:43:24.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m having to do it top-down all I</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.360" end="00:43:28.010" style="s2">see it exactly the way you just</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.710" end="00:43:29.690" style="s2">described the David the art I think the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.010" end="00:43:32.000" style="s2">dysfunction that we have in today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.690" end="00:43:33.110" style="s2">system in this game a is that just like</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.000" end="00:43:38.470" style="s2">that neural network</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.110" end="00:43:42.650" style="s2">you&#39;ve got did you call it a molecule or</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.470" end="00:43:45.500" style="s2">so whatever it doesn&#39;t matter the</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.650" end="00:43:47.840" style="s2">individual in this neural network that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.500" end="00:43:50.540" style="s2">contains millions or billions the</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.840" end="00:43:54.830" style="s2">problem with him existing dynamic is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.540" end="00:43:57.800" style="s2">that one cell is able to control and</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.830" end="00:43:59.180" style="s2">make decisions instantaneously for</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.800" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">millions and billions of the other cells</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.180" end="00:44:05.480" style="s2">without taking input in allowing the</p>

<p begin="00:44:05.480" end="00:44:09.890" style="s2">have their say and to control the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.150" end="00:44:14.210" style="s2">direction like a flock of starlings</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.890" end="00:44:16.690" style="s2">start what would you go it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.210" end="00:44:19.010" style="s2">thing but this is the description of</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.690" end="00:44:22.130" style="s2">top-down economics that we have today</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.010" end="00:44:25.010" style="s2">you know one person controls this supply</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.130" end="00:44:28.340" style="s2">of oil the supply of gold or this supply</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.010" end="00:44:31.330" style="s2">of wheat etc and so without any input</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.340" end="00:44:33.830" style="s2">from you know below besides this</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.330" end="00:44:36.740" style="s2">arbitrary you know price mechanism that</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.830" end="00:44:38.750" style="s2">we pretend is in all all seeing in all</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.740" end="00:44:40.790" style="s2">comes and but it&#39;s actually not the</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.750" end="00:44:43.910" style="s2">people control the resources ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.790" end="00:44:45.950" style="s2">are making decisions that are not taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.910" end="00:44:48.200" style="s2">all the rest of the stakeholders into</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.950" end="00:44:51.380" style="s2">place so we have a dysfunction of one</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.200" end="00:44:53.360" style="s2">cell making billions of decisions for</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.380" end="00:44:55.070" style="s2">others I mean negating us that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.360" end="00:44:57.650" style="s2">cancer but you know in our body if one</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.070" end="00:44:59.930" style="s2">cell had that power we would take that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.650" end="00:45:03.020" style="s2">can&#39;t they sell out because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.930" end="00:45:05.450" style="s2">it&#39;s benefiting itself in its group but</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.020" end="00:45:07.100" style="s2">to the detriment of our entire host and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.450" end="00:45:09.470" style="s2">this is kind of what capitalism is doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.100" end="00:45:12.290" style="s2">today it the the corporations to their</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.470" end="00:45:14.360" style="s2">individual benefit are winning but at</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.290" end="00:45:16.910" style="s2">the cost of potentially destroying the</p>

<p begin="00:45:16.910" end="00:45:22.520" style="s2">need the rest of us need also to survive</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.490" end="00:45:25.310" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s it exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.520" end="00:45:29.000" style="s2">just like I think I&#39;m the bottom-up</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.310" end="00:45:35.050" style="s2">approach is for me anyway finding how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.000" end="00:45:38.030" style="s2">have that type of interconnection with a</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.050" end="00:45:40.940" style="s2">small group of people and it growing and</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.030" end="00:45:43.010" style="s2">like growing systematically where every</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.940" end="00:45:45.050" style="s2">new person that comes in is adding their</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.010" end="00:45:46.250" style="s2">piece of that neural network is adding</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.050" end="00:45:49.010" style="s2">their connections their dot other</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.250" end="00:45:51.110" style="s2">information and when we can figure it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.010" end="00:45:53.360" style="s2">out including what&#39;s not working and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.110" end="00:45:55.160" style="s2">what&#39;s working for 10,000 people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.360" end="00:45:56.840" style="s2">not that hard to get to 20,000 it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.160" end="00:46:00.230" style="s2">that hard to get to 40,000 right like</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.840" end="00:46:01.340" style="s2">it&#39;s and from that space and we figure</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.230" end="00:46:02.690" style="s2">out how to make it work for a million</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.340" end="00:46:04.430" style="s2">people we&#39;re not gonna let our</p>

<p begin="00:46:04.430" end="00:46:07.940" style="s2">over us because we&#39;re like like right</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:11.330" style="s2">now we&#39;re like what else is there we</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.940" end="00:46:12.740" style="s2">need a centralized idea who we think</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.330" end="00:46:14.420" style="s2">have better knowledge than we do to run</p>

<p begin="00:46:16.610" end="00:46:19.430" style="s2">they clearly don&#39;t know what the eff is</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.840" end="00:46:20.870" style="s2">going on like they clearly are they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.870" end="00:51:37.710" style="s2">any of that right I&#39;d like to come back</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.150" end="00:51:39.660" style="s2">to something Brent said a little while</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.420" end="00:51:55.230" style="s2">you said before Brent about you know for</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.670" end="00:51:59.820" style="s2">example commune experiments that have</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.230" end="00:52:01.430" style="s2">been tried essentially living game B</p>

<p begin="00:52:01.430" end="00:52:08.130" style="s2">but that they broke down because of you</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.360" end="00:52:09.750" style="s2">you alluded to the idea of power I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.130" end="00:52:12.510" style="s2">assuming what you mean by that was</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.750" end="00:52:14.220" style="s2">people seeking power over others within</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.510" end="00:52:17.270" style="s2">that collective in some way or another</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.220" end="00:52:21.110" style="s2">right and so are you saying that that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.270" end="00:52:23.220" style="s2">even when you are in a non rival hrus</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.110" end="00:52:24.990" style="s2">environment in that you&#39;re not competing</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.220" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">for food and so on right this is all</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.990" end="00:52:28.470" style="s2">this is all you know part of the</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.360" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">itself is that what you&#39;re saying yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.490" end="00:52:38.880" style="s2">from what I recall</p>

<p begin="00:52:38.880" end="00:52:42.090" style="s2">answer can I just add one more part of</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.410" end="00:52:44.520" style="s2">the question though are you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.090" end="00:52:46.620" style="s2">that is an inevitable part of human</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.520" end="00:52:48.090" style="s2">nature or could that be put down to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.620" end="00:52:51.600" style="s2">fact that the people that entered those</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.090" end="00:52:53.130" style="s2">communes grew up in rivalry environment</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.600" end="00:52:54.930" style="s2">and had learned that behavior from a</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.130" end="00:52:58.460" style="s2">very very young age that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.930" end="00:53:00.840" style="s2">end of my question yeah it can be both</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.460" end="00:53:04.260" style="s2">from what I remember of the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.840" end="00:53:06.300" style="s2">that was the thesis basically that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.260" end="00:53:08.730" style="s2">know whether it&#39;s human nature or people</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.300" end="00:53:12.270" style="s2">were just socialized into game a yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.730" end="00:53:14.670" style="s2">power dynamics and you know wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.270" end="00:53:19.530" style="s2">be a leader or whatever kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.670" end="00:53:21.840" style="s2">distorted certain functionality of it so</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.530" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an important documentary to</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.840" end="00:53:31.380" style="s2">revisit and you know to think of all of</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:33.270" style="s2">these social experiments that way yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.380" end="00:53:36.510" style="s2">think you know like technology is</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.270" end="00:53:37.650" style="s2">constantly changing too so the the issue</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.510" end="00:53:41.970" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.650" end="00:53:45.089" style="s2">the topic of post-scarcity is more you</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.970" end="00:53:46.740" style="s2">know salient and achievable so we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.089" end="00:53:47.940" style="s2">kind of put some of these dynamics and</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.740" end="00:53:50.970" style="s2">check the other thing is if there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.940" end="00:53:52.470" style="s2">human nature seeking power you know we</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.970" end="00:53:54.420" style="s2">need to sublimate that into other</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.470" end="00:53:56.880" style="s2">activities whether it&#39;s sports or</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.420" end="00:53:59.480" style="s2">whatever it&#39;s like you know you do it in</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.880" end="00:54:01.859" style="s2">a conscious participatory way without</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.480" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">you know it has it has a safety net</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.859" end="00:54:07.319" style="s2">there&#39;s not a risk of dying for example</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:09.450" style="s2">in a competitive sport you&#39;re just in it</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.319" end="00:54:11.789" style="s2">for love of love of the game and love of</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:13.529" style="s2">kind of pure competition right within a</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.789" end="00:54:16.619" style="s2">certain rule structure so it can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.529" end="00:54:18.630" style="s2">healthy so you know whatever game B</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.619" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">turns out to be obviously people need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.630" end="00:54:26.190" style="s2">be able to opt in to game a types of</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:29.130" style="s2">dynamics for the the generativity that</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.190" end="00:54:31.380" style="s2">they have but it needs to be hot you</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.130" end="00:54:35.369" style="s2">know for lack of a better word regulated</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.380" end="00:54:38.069" style="s2">right because what we have now is not</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.369" end="00:54:41.420" style="s2">just capitalism like it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.069" end="00:54:43.499" style="s2">unfettered capitalism a lot of the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.420" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">extraction that we talk about it wealth</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.499" end="00:54:48.779" style="s2">is very very abstract like it&#39;s all just</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:51.509" style="s2">on paper it&#39;s you know algorithms moving</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.779" end="00:54:55.529" style="s2">moving numbers around and it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.509" end="00:54:57.720" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a very selfish aspects</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.529" end="00:54:59.700" style="s2">to this that people are just enriching</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.720" end="00:55:02.519" style="s2">themselves and it&#39;s it&#39;s undermining the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.700" end="00:55:04.529" style="s2">entire global system right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.519" end="00:55:10.890" style="s2">something we all have to reconcile with</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.529" end="00:55:12.480" style="s2">elites especially but yeah this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.890" end="00:55:14.549" style="s2">extraction like it&#39;s it&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.480" end="00:55:18.589" style="s2">prevalent than people think</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.549" end="00:55:20.430" style="s2">I think it&#39;s just this is this is the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.589" end="00:55:22.380" style="s2">central pathology of late-stage</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.430" end="00:55:24.420" style="s2">capitalism it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.380" end="00:55:28.519" style="s2">finance but it&#39;s every extractive</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.420" end="00:55:32.029" style="s2">industry that there&#39;s no kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.519" end="00:55:34.200" style="s2">conscience about how those resources</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.029" end="00:55:37.650" style="s2">trickle down through the company or</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.200" end="00:55:39.660" style="s2">through the society you know it cost 50</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.650" end="00:55:42.239" style="s2">peanuts go for a piss in a train station</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.660" end="00:55:43.920" style="s2">in London 50 P to take a piss in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.239" end="00:55:45.809" style="s2">train station a public train say what</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.920" end="00:55:47.549" style="s2">what are your choices yeah it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.809" end="00:55:49.710" style="s2">absurd and and the implication of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.549" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">too is if you&#39;re gonna put a little kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.710" end="00:55:55.490" style="s2">of Norma</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:57.530" style="s2">be on it you know how much further does</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.490" end="00:56:00.110" style="s2">it go do you have cops on the payroll</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.530" end="00:56:02.690" style="s2">that enforced that they go around and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.110" end="00:56:04.070" style="s2">humiliate people and and target less</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.690" end="00:56:08.530" style="s2">privileged people right it&#39;s a slippery</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.070" end="00:56:11.420" style="s2">slope so we need to have a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.530" end="00:56:12.890" style="s2">systemic consciousness that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.420" end="00:56:14.660" style="s2">implement policies like that in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.890" end="00:56:17.360" style="s2">first place like and you got to keep in</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.660" end="00:56:19.670" style="s2">mind that that policy very well may have</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.360" end="00:56:22.490" style="s2">been the outcome of some focus group or</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.670" end="00:56:24.730" style="s2">or consultation that made it seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.490" end="00:56:24.730" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.030" end="00:56:30.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a beautiful notion and I actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.620" end="00:56:32.270" style="s2">like that quite a bit that I do want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.680" end="00:56:34.690" style="s2">watch the can you say the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.270" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">talking about we&#39;ve all watched over by</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.690" end="00:56:40.070" style="s2">machines of loving grace it&#39;s a mouthful</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:41.780" style="s2">of a title but I I would I would say</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.070" end="00:56:43.400" style="s2">check out all of Adam curtis&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.780" end="00:56:45.350" style="s2">right his latest documentary want to say</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.400" end="00:56:49.880" style="s2">be tough on us knows that pretend yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.350" end="00:56:52.550" style="s2">hyper normalization it&#39;s just it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.880" end="00:56:54.320" style="s2">so I wanted to say that there is a you</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.550" end="00:56:56.360" style="s2">know one of the things that I that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.320" end="00:56:59.630" style="s2">typically do is I think of metaphors and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.360" end="00:57:01.580" style="s2">think of systemic behavior and I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.630" end="00:57:03.980" style="s2">think it&#39;s not so much extractive it is</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.580" end="00:57:07.910" style="s2">rival risk but I actually think that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.980" end="00:57:09.740" style="s2">it&#39;s um it&#39;s and I&#39;m gonna say that I</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.910" end="00:57:12.380" style="s2">think it&#39;s an evolutionary tendency I</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.740" end="00:57:14.390" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually a law of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.380" end="00:57:16.940" style="s2">thermodynamics to some extent in this</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.390" end="00:57:19.010" style="s2">way that when there&#39;s a surplus and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.940" end="00:57:23.270" style="s2">best way to get to that is with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.010" end="00:57:26.030" style="s2">hierarchical structure that in some way</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.270" end="00:57:28.040" style="s2">what happens in that mode is authority</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.030" end="00:57:29.840" style="s2">as externalized it does make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.040" end="00:57:31.370" style="s2">have a king or a father or God an</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.840" end="00:57:33.080" style="s2">external authority figure that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.370" end="00:57:35.420" style="s2">following those rules and mandates for</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.080" end="00:57:38.330" style="s2">we&#39;re following them in a to the letter</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.420" end="00:57:40.760" style="s2">kind of a mode in that the whole of</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.330" end="00:57:43.370" style="s2">civilization with literacy and alphabet</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.760" end="00:57:47.140" style="s2">and numeracy and organization and laws</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.370" end="00:57:50.570" style="s2">does organize under this very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.140" end="00:57:54.070" style="s2">external authority model which if I</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.570" end="00:57:56.210" style="s2">think of within a family unit the father</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.070" end="00:57:57.560" style="s2">the patriarch moley this is the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.210" end="00:57:59.720" style="s2">direction that we&#39;re going in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.560" end="00:58:02.120" style="s2">children are rival risk right the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.720" end="00:58:03.810" style="s2">sibling rivalry is a fight for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.120" end="00:58:06.540" style="s2">available resources and</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.810" end="00:58:09.420" style="s2">necessary to be able to grow they need</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.540" end="00:58:13.430" style="s2">to be as greedy as it can to grow to a</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.420" end="00:58:16.050" style="s2">healthy adult but in a mode where that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.430" end="00:58:18.600" style="s2">surplus is no longer available when the</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.050" end="00:58:20.220" style="s2">children grow to adult it rivalry in</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.600" end="00:58:22.110" style="s2">that way does it make they need to</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.220" end="00:58:24.120" style="s2">switch into an adult mode in which</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.110" end="00:58:26.460" style="s2">they&#39;re actually working together and</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.120" end="00:58:28.920" style="s2">that&#39;s what I think the game D model I</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.460" end="00:58:30.720" style="s2">actually think that it&#39;s not even game a</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.920" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">and game B in terms of grab reversal not</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.720" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">harvest I think it actually is something</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:39.180" style="s2">more like appropriate regulation to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:41.730" style="s2">way of responding to our environmental</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.180" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">needs and our internal needs as we go</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.730" end="00:58:45.570" style="s2">I&#39;ll give an example that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:48.420" style="s2">really beautiful illustration of that in</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.570" end="00:58:51.300" style="s2">the movie march of the Penguins number</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.420" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">of years ago as Morgan Freeman is</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.300" end="00:58:56.160" style="s2">describing their activity one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.840" style="s2">things he notices is as the Penguins are</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.160" end="00:58:58.500" style="s2">marching to their mating ground you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.840" end="00:58:59.790" style="s2">two moves</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.500" end="00:59:03.120" style="s2">they&#39;re either marching in a straight</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.790" end="00:59:06.300" style="s2">line or the occasionally will huddle</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.120" end="00:59:09.140" style="s2">when they seem to be lost the no window</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.300" end="00:59:11.820" style="s2">huddle collectively sort of vibrating</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.140" end="00:59:13.380" style="s2">until they know collectively with the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.820" end="00:59:15.360" style="s2">direction and now they go into a line</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.380" end="00:59:17.790" style="s2">mode again and so that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.360" end="00:59:19.290" style="s2">efficient way if we continue to go in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.790" end="00:59:21.450" style="s2">line then they&#39;re lost they&#39;re sure to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.290" end="00:59:22.410" style="s2">die if they continue to huddle past the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.450" end="00:59:24.690" style="s2">point to know where they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.410" end="00:59:27.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll die it&#39;s an appropriate scaling</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.690" end="00:59:30.300" style="s2">as moving quickly or moving slowly and</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.480" end="00:59:33.380" style="s2">in some way I would say the analogy is</p>

<p begin="01:00:39.550" end="01:00:45.430" style="s2">to say we&#39;ve reached the our point so</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.650" end="01:00:47.680" style="s2">many of everyone a closing statement and</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.430" end="01:00:49.300" style="s2">then we are gonna stop recording and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.680" end="01:00:51.070" style="s2">love where this conversation is going</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.300" end="01:00:52.960" style="s2">though and I think there&#39;s something in</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.070" end="01:00:55.360" style="s2">the interplay of like power and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.960" end="01:00:57.220" style="s2">hierarchy and if we can after we stop</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.360" end="01:00:59.980" style="s2">recording create a question together for</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.220" end="01:01:02.230" style="s2">next week to explore so that we can each</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.980" end="01:01:04.470" style="s2">take a turn sharing on that that makes</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.230" end="01:01:06.820" style="s2">sense that is a question and then um</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.470" end="01:01:08.140" style="s2">come back next week and have this</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.820" end="01:01:09.880" style="s2">conversation is I think it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.140" end="01:01:11.230" style="s2">powerful and an important one and I know</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.880" end="01:01:13.630" style="s2">I have thoughts on it and if your</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.230" end="01:01:16.420" style="s2">closing statements are about it you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.630" end="01:01:21.340" style="s2">more than welcome so who would like to</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.420" end="01:01:23.380" style="s2">go first with their quizzes I&#39;ll start</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.340" end="01:01:25.270" style="s2">I&#39;ll just say and real briefly I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.380" end="01:01:27.070" style="s2">excited it for this I love the way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.270" end="01:01:28.300" style="s2">this is kind of come together and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.070" end="01:01:30.820" style="s2">think this is the kind of conversation</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.300" end="01:01:33.220" style="s2">that no I look forward to and as you</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.820" end="01:01:34.420" style="s2">start to look more at game be a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.220" end="01:01:36.550" style="s2">bit less of the contentious you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.420" end="01:01:37.840" style="s2">either/or and more there okay look at</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.550" end="01:01:40.300" style="s2">what is it that we&#39;re really saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.840" end="01:01:49.180" style="s2">the compass so I&#39;m very grateful for you</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.300" end="01:01:51.400" style="s2">putting this together if I can just add</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.180" end="01:01:53.020" style="s2">to David&#39;s also I&#39;m grateful you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.400" end="01:01:55.500" style="s2">this is wonderful that we&#39;re doing this</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.020" end="01:01:57.790" style="s2">and Julie thank you for this again just</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.500" end="01:02:01.120" style="s2">to go back to what David was just</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.790" end="01:02:03.190" style="s2">mentioning a moment ago is the we have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.120" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">system of production extraction in</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.190" end="01:02:06.580" style="s2">production so we&#39;ve got specific rules</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:08.590" style="s2">that either incentivize or</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.580" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">disincentivize certain extraction of</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.590" end="01:02:13.000" style="s2">certain production and so and then based</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">on that production you either have</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.000" end="01:02:17.740" style="s2">access or you don&#39;t and if you don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:21.100" style="s2">even if you do you still need a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.740" end="01:02:24.010" style="s2">distribution system so the thing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.100" end="01:02:26.710" style="s2">humanities always been fighting for I</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.010" end="01:02:29.150" style="s2">think are the rules governing you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.710" end="01:02:30.500" style="s2">essentially the ownership and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.150" end="01:02:35.089" style="s2">production part of it and part of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.500" end="01:02:37.789" style="s2">critique of communism was whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.089" end="01:02:39.980" style="s2">that particular model those guys can</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.789" end="01:02:42.109" style="s2">produce enough things in order to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.980" end="01:02:43.339" style="s2">satisfy the demand whatever they can</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.109" end="01:02:46.010" style="s2">continue the production they can</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.339" end="01:02:51.950" style="s2">continue to incentivize and to have</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.010" end="01:02:54.740" style="s2">access and so but the the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.950" end="01:02:57.380" style="s2">part of it I think is is has been</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.740" end="01:02:58.579" style="s2">neglected for more than so the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.380" end="01:03:00.260" style="s2">production part of it the production</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.579" end="01:03:01.880" style="s2">part they thought they had the answer of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.260" end="01:03:03.589" style="s2">course they didn&#39;t they failed they lost</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.880" end="01:03:07.579" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t answer the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.589" end="01:03:09.589" style="s2">distribution question after so by not</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.579" end="01:03:12.289" style="s2">linking those two they didn&#39;t come up</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.589" end="01:03:14.720" style="s2">with a good system and so you know I</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.289" end="01:03:16.910" style="s2">think we can do both we can have a good</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.720" end="01:03:18.410" style="s2">production distribution excuse me good</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.910" end="01:03:21.890" style="s2">production system where we can produce</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.410" end="01:03:25.549" style="s2">enough things to meet demand and we can</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.890" end="01:03:28.520" style="s2">solve the problem of distribution by you</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.549" end="01:03:30.289" style="s2">know utilizing a currency in a different</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.520" end="01:03:34.369" style="s2">methodology that allows for an open</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.289" end="01:03:36.319" style="s2">market but that&#39;s not based on the</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.369" end="01:03:37.789" style="s2">metrics like we see today who can sell</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.319" end="01:03:39.740" style="s2">the most and that&#39;s it still the</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.789" end="01:03:41.539" style="s2">extraction model meaning if I can just</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.740" end="01:03:45.020" style="s2">extract and cut down more trees I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.539" end="01:03:47.089" style="s2">make more money right and so as long as</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.020" end="01:03:49.880" style="s2">the distribution model doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.089" end="01:03:52.880" style="s2">incentivize that kind of behavior then</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.880" end="01:04:00.289" style="s2">we&#39;re on the right track so I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.880" end="01:04:01.819" style="s2">leave it there I&#39;ve just got a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.289" end="01:04:03.829" style="s2">things to say I mean I&#39;m intrigued by</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.819" end="01:04:06.410" style="s2">what Brent said earlier on about</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.829" end="01:04:08.180" style="s2">coordinating the bottom-up efforts with</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.410" end="01:04:09.950" style="s2">the top-down efforts and in the abstract</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.180" end="01:04:11.660" style="s2">I absolutely agree with you but the</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.950" end="01:04:13.549" style="s2">problem with that idea in my opinion is</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.660" end="01:04:14.750" style="s2">that the interests of the bottom-up in</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.549" end="01:04:16.160" style="s2">the interest of the top-down are</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.750" end="01:04:17.390" style="s2">misaligned at the moment and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.160" end="01:04:18.859" style="s2">no way of coordinating these things</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.390" end="01:04:21.589" style="s2">because they&#39;re they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.859" end="01:04:23.359" style="s2">fundamentally not in alignment with each</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.589" end="01:04:25.760" style="s2">other so much as I like the idea in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.359" end="01:04:28.220" style="s2">abstract I don&#39;t think it really applies</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.760" end="01:04:30.289" style="s2">I do think the transition is specially</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.220" end="01:04:32.270" style="s2">given what was said earlier about you</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.289" end="01:04:35.029" style="s2">know not having actually a clear idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.270" end="01:04:36.410" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to transit towards and</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.029" end="01:04:38.000" style="s2">therefore can&#39;t lay out a clear up</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.410" end="01:04:39.260" style="s2">matter what the transition looked like I</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.000" end="01:04:41.450" style="s2">come back to what I said earlier about</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.260" end="01:04:42.570" style="s2">the idea of experiments small-scale</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.450" end="01:04:44.370" style="s2">experiments the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.570" end="01:04:46.020" style="s2">facts of which can be contained right if</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.370" end="01:04:47.700" style="s2">they go dreadfully wrong the effects of</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.020" end="01:04:49.140" style="s2">them can be contained and the mess</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.700" end="01:04:51.030" style="s2">mopped up afterwards you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.140" end="01:04:54.180" style="s2">without anyone without anyone suffering</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.030" end="01:04:56.040" style="s2">sooo badly I would really like to see a</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.180" end="01:04:57.330" style="s2">rerun of the kind of experiments Brent</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.040" end="01:05:00.060" style="s2">was talking about that we&#39;re done back</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.330" end="01:05:01.730" style="s2">in the 70s you know if you&#39;d put a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.060" end="01:05:05.550" style="s2">couple of thousand people into a</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.730" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">self-sustaining unit with access to you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.550" end="01:05:09.810" style="s2">know technology and the internet and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:11.730" style="s2">on it&#39;s not a bubble right and and see</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.810" end="01:05:13.230" style="s2">if those same sort of power dynamics do</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.730" end="01:05:15.300" style="s2">start to emerge you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.230" end="01:05:16.860" style="s2">psychologists there as well to guide</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.300" end="01:05:18.900" style="s2">people through the process and analyze</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.860" end="01:05:20.550" style="s2">what&#39;s going on I mean I really think</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.900" end="01:05:22.530" style="s2">running these kinds of experiments now</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.550" end="01:05:24.420" style="s2">in the light of modern understandings</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.530" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">with you know technology and the ability</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.420" end="01:05:27.780" style="s2">to completely alleviate scarcity of all</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:31.200" style="s2">kinds at least on a small scale like</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.780" end="01:05:32.760" style="s2">that I I do think the value in running</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.200" end="01:05:34.830" style="s2">these kinds of experiments can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.760" end="01:05:36.570" style="s2">overstated and I think that is how the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.830" end="01:05:38.490" style="s2">transition will occur is doing these</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.570" end="01:05:40.440" style="s2">things people seeing oh look that really</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.490" end="01:05:41.880" style="s2">fucking works let&#39;s see if we can scale</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.440" end="01:05:43.860" style="s2">that up all that really didn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.880" end="01:05:46.020" style="s2">let&#39;s see if we can figure out why and</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.860" end="01:05:50.420" style="s2">try again you know III think this has</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.020" end="01:05:50.420" style="s2">got to be the modality of transition</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.250" end="01:06:03.720" style="s2">Brett do you have any closure I think I</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.770" end="01:06:07.020" style="s2">would just offer one correction that you</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.720" end="01:06:09.930" style="s2">know the you know top-down or elite</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.020" end="01:06:12.000" style="s2">strata it&#39;s not monolithic right like um</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.930" end="01:06:14.940" style="s2">I tried to make the point that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.000" end="01:06:16.920" style="s2">lots of factions within that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.940" end="01:06:18.510" style="s2">there&#39;s nihilists there&#39;s progressives</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.920" end="01:06:20.210" style="s2">you know there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.510" end="01:06:24.530" style="s2">well-intentioned people like Bill Gates</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.210" end="01:06:27.030" style="s2">who you know mmm critiques can be made</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.530" end="01:06:30.470" style="s2">about what their what their impact is</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.030" end="01:06:33.590" style="s2">right and and this idea of you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.470" end="01:06:35.820" style="s2">philanthropy and and the rich kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.590" end="01:06:39.780" style="s2">mm-hmm you know buying their way out of</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.820" end="01:06:42.450" style="s2">the the problem is is super important</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.780" end="01:06:44.970" style="s2">and I just watched an interview from a</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.450" end="01:06:48.390" style="s2">month ago of anon geared artists at</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.970" end="01:06:50.220" style="s2">Harvard and he was critical of Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.390" end="01:06:52.590" style="s2">while he was there because it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.220" end="01:06:54.120" style="s2">an image laundering factory right</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.590" end="01:06:56.310" style="s2">someone like Jeffrey Epstein can just</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.120" end="01:06:58.260" style="s2">donate money to it</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.310" end="01:07:00.300" style="s2">and it&#39;s a kind of mutually beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.260" end="01:07:02.850" style="s2">relationship but there&#39;s a sinister</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.300" end="01:07:04.590" style="s2">underbelly to it so we got to address</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.850" end="01:07:06.690" style="s2">the root crisis in all of these</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.590" end="01:07:10.830" style="s2">situations right and some elites do know</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.690" end="01:07:12.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why they were open with Anand in</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.830" end="01:07:17.100" style="s2">his research and in his public</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.630" end="01:07:18.270" style="s2">disclosure of these reality so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.100" end="01:07:20.010" style="s2">kind of a tipping point there and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.270" end="01:07:22.770" style="s2">need to be clear about what type of lead</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.010" end="01:07:25.260" style="s2">ism we we support and want to work with</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.770" end="01:07:27.000" style="s2">and participate and and to bring it back</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.260" end="01:07:30.960" style="s2">to Bernie Sanders like he&#39;s a populist</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.000" end="01:07:35.220" style="s2">form of that he is a on every man and I</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.960" end="01:07:38.280" style="s2">kind of a blue-collar a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.220" end="01:07:40.380" style="s2">intellectual and leader and I think he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.280" end="01:07:41.880" style="s2">the right person important I mean he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.380" end="01:07:43.380" style="s2">the person that&#39;s been chosen by the</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.880" end="01:07:46.110" style="s2">progressive movement right so when he</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.380" end="01:07:49.740" style="s2">announced his candidacy in the last</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.110" end="01:07:53.910" style="s2">election it was a long shot but it</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.740" end="01:07:56.640" style="s2">surged and you know actually at one</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.910" end="01:07:59.340" style="s2">point in the primary kind of matched</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.640" end="01:08:00.990" style="s2">Clinton for fur the prospect of winning</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.340" end="01:08:03.650" style="s2">you know they all know they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.990" end="01:08:06.690" style="s2">polls the poll numbers almost crossed</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.650" end="01:08:08.850" style="s2">hmm and there was a lot going on behind</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.690" end="01:08:12.140" style="s2">the scenes to that minute deletes those</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.850" end="01:08:14.910" style="s2">numbers and that that ultimately stabs</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.140" end="01:08:17.670" style="s2">Bernie in the back and then gave the</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.910" end="01:08:19.470" style="s2">election to Trump so you know on the</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.670" end="01:08:20.910" style="s2">ground we need to be conscious of these</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.470" end="01:08:23.160" style="s2">things upfront because I think there was</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.910" end="01:08:25.530" style="s2">lots of people in 2016 that saw what was</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.160" end="01:08:27.900" style="s2">happening for what it was but they</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.530" end="01:08:31.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t win they didn&#39;t get the the</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.900" end="01:08:34.770" style="s2">dominance their voice heard in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.500" end="01:08:36.569" style="s2">discourse right and I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.770" end="01:08:39.000" style="s2">elite establishments like the New York</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.569" end="01:08:43.530" style="s2">Times and whatnot they helped you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.000" end="01:08:49.020" style="s2">kind of you know hand this election to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.530" end="01:08:54.780" style="s2">to a new plutocratic regime in trumpet</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.020" end="01:08:56.850" style="s2">and the cabinet that be selected so I</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.780" end="01:08:58.650" style="s2">mean the final I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.850" end="01:09:00.180" style="s2">doing for time but the final point I</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.650" end="01:09:02.490" style="s2">would make is just to bring it back to</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.180" end="01:09:04.890" style="s2">the time window we have and the long</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.490" end="01:09:07.910" style="s2">term historical window of globalization</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.890" end="01:09:09.620" style="s2">because like like the you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.910" end="01:09:13.010" style="s2">geopolitics has</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.620" end="01:09:15.020" style="s2">it&#39;s own kind of momentum and and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.010" end="01:09:17.540" style="s2">narratives that play out right but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.020" end="01:09:21.170" style="s2">at this new junction with the internet</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.540" end="01:09:24.140" style="s2">and you know 21st century 4th Industrial</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.170" end="01:09:25.850" style="s2">Revolution bringing us together breaking</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.140" end="01:09:27.290" style="s2">down those barriers whether we like it</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.850" end="01:09:32.240" style="s2">or not right and there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.290" end="01:09:34.730" style="s2">friction around that but we you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.240" end="01:09:37.370" style="s2">only way out is through and to to</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.730" end="01:09:40.910" style="s2">rebuild the global order which has been</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.370" end="01:09:45.530" style="s2">underfunded and and really hamstrung by</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.910" end="01:09:47.600" style="s2">militarism hey so thank you everyone for</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.530" end="01:09:49.730" style="s2">coming and participating in this idea</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:51.620" style="s2">cafe we&#39;re gonna try to keep them to an</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.730" end="01:09:53.480" style="s2">hour for the game be even though more</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.620" end="01:09:55.490" style="s2">study a cafes or half an hour</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.480" end="01:09:58.490" style="s2">I know game be a kinko for three hours</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.490" end="01:10:02.090" style="s2">seems to be our like average amount for</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.490" end="01:10:04.070" style="s2">conversation which I&#39;m pretty much</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.090" end="01:10:06.680" style="s2">anything quite honest yeah exactly and</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.070" end="01:10:08.150" style="s2">so kind of I like the idea of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.680" end="01:10:09.680" style="s2">gonna do which is kind of creating the</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.150" end="01:10:11.480" style="s2">next question based on like where this</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.680" end="01:10:14.120" style="s2">one ended off and there&#39;s there&#39;s energy</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.480" end="01:10:16.700" style="s2">around it because I think that figuring</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.120" end="01:10:20.560" style="s2">out how to effectively move forward as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.700" end="01:10:23.690" style="s2">society without hierarchical power down</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.560" end="01:10:25.370" style="s2">dynamics is how we create it and so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.690" end="01:10:27.140" style="s2">more we can play in that space and</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.370" end="01:10:29.210" style="s2">figure it out in groups of five and</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.140" end="01:10:31.310" style="s2">groups of 20 and groups of 50 in groups</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.210" end="01:10:33.260" style="s2">a thousand and figure out how to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.310" end="01:10:35.870" style="s2">that is what the idea behind the idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.260" end="01:10:38.690" style="s2">cafe is is to create a platform that</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.870" end="01:10:40.160" style="s2">brings together people to have a</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.690" end="01:10:41.330" style="s2">conversation and then how do we figure</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.160" end="01:10:42.890" style="s2">that out what&#39;s working what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.330" end="01:10:44.780" style="s2">working and move forward with it so</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.890" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">thanks for coming and participating in</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.780" end="01:10:48.400" style="s2">that and we&#39;ll say goodbye to YouTube</p>
