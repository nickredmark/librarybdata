<p begin="00:00:27.260" end="00:00:32.570" style="s2">The last time we talked, I started to walk<br />you through the nervous system a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.570" end="00:00:38.400" style="s2">and we started with the monkey business illusion,<br />and one of the things that&#39;s really remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.400" end="00:00:43.660" style="s2">about the monkey business illusion is that--and<br />change blindness illusions in general--is</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.660" end="00:00:51.000" style="s2">that demonstrate to you just to what degree<br />you could either describe yourself as blind</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.000" end="00:00:52.199" style="s2">or focused.</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.199" end="00:00:55.410" style="s2">And I think focused is actually better than<br />blind.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.410" end="00:01:00.270" style="s2">You know, a laser beam doesn&#39;t cover much<br />area, but it really illuminates what it strikes.</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.270" end="00:01:05.900" style="s2">And people are sort of like that, we&#39;re really<br />beamed into a single point and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.900" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">metaphysically spectacular about that, I think,<br />because that single point that we&#39;re narrowed</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:18.420" style="s2">down to is in some sense the thing that writes<br />the world, you know, because as we interact</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.420" end="00:01:23.049" style="s2">with the world we&#39;re able to turn it one way<br />or another in all sorts of complicated ways.</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.049" end="00:01:28.300" style="s2">And, I mean, I know our powers of doing so<br />are obviously constrained to a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.300" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">degree, but by the same token, that focal<br />point of concentration enables us to interact</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">with the world and then, at least seemingly,<br />to change it according to our will.</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.610" style="s2">It&#39;s like we take a future that&#39;s potential,<br />we interact with it at a focal point, and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.610" end="00:01:51.610" style="s2">then it transforms itself into a past that&#39;s<br />in some sense fixed and real.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.610" end="00:01:53.780" style="s2">So that&#39;s pretty strange.</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.780" end="00:01:57.870" style="s2">So I guess you don&#39;t want to underestimate<br />the utility of a point.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.870" end="00:02:04.620" style="s2">I want to talk to you a little bit first more<br />about what you&#39;re blind to and then what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.620" end="00:02:07.100" style="s2">consequences of that are.</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.100" end="00:02:16.849" style="s2">So, this here is a little diagram of a computer,<br />believe it or not--a conceptual diagram of</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.849" end="00:02:22.730" style="s2">a computer--and it&#39;s predicated on...</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.730" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you a quick story.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:29.849" style="s2">If I&#39;ve told you this story please stop me,<br />but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve told you guys this</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.849" end="00:02:30.989" style="s2">story.</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.989" end="00:02:39.930" style="s2">So one day back in about 1987 I was working<br />on my computer and I was typing some long</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.930" end="00:02:45.159" style="s2">essay in DOS and, you really had to back up<br />in those days because the programs didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.159" end="00:02:49.739" style="s2">do any back up for you and so if the program<br />shut off and you hadn&#39;t been super careful</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.739" end="00:02:50.739" style="s2">you were just going to lose all of it.</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.739" end="00:02:55.980" style="s2">And so that&#39;s what happened--I was typing<br />when the computer went off and so, I had an</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.980" end="00:02:58.010" style="s2">emotional reaction to that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.010" end="00:03:03.379" style="s2">Right, now an emotional reaction to that is<br />kind of an interesting event because, I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.379" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">say that you&#39;re not even working with the<br />computer until it quits.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:11.680" style="s2">And the reason I would say that is because,<br />if you think about it, when the computer is</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.680" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">functioning the fact that it&#39;s an extraordinarily<br />complicated device is basically irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:17.680" style="s2">to you.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.680" end="00:03:22.579" style="s2">What you&#39;re working with, roughly speaking,<br />is the screen, but not really, not even the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.579" end="00:03:23.579" style="s2">screen.</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.579" end="00:03:29.129" style="s2">You&#39;re working with maybe a phrase or even<br />the word that&#39;s presented on the screen.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.129" end="00:03:37.870" style="s2">You know, you&#39;re typing the word/phrase/sentence/paragraph/essay,<br />and only out past that domain of consideration</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.870" end="00:03:42.200" style="s2">do you start thinking about the hardware technology<br />that underlies what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.200" end="00:03:45.000" style="s2">You don&#39;t want to think about that at all.</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.000" end="00:03:49.139" style="s2">When something&#39;s working, you don&#39;t have to<br />see it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.139" end="00:03:51.930" style="s2">And so that gives you a clue as to consciousness.</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.930" end="00:03:57.620" style="s2">Consciousness is an error detecting and correcting<br />phenomena, and you&#39;re not conscious of things</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.620" end="00:04:00.370" style="s2">that are going well.</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.370" end="00:04:04.029" style="s2">You know, which might explain to some degree<br />why a lot of our life seems to be made up</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.029" end="00:04:05.269" style="s2">of suffering.</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.269" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">If things are going well, it isn&#39;t exactly<br />like you&#39;re happy if things are going well,</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:13.360" style="s2">you just don&#39;t notice when they&#39;re going well.</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.360" end="00:04:17.550" style="s2">Sometimes if they unexpectedly go well, then<br />that makes you happy.</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.550" end="00:04:24.180" style="s2">But otherwise it&#39;s just the same old thing,<br />even if it&#39;s amazing.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.180" end="00:04:28.210" style="s2">I was--yesterday--I was eating breakfast with<br />my son and I was complaining about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.210" end="00:04:32.669" style="s2">that I had to eat canned-smoked tuna because<br />I don&#39;t really like fish, but I have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.669" end="00:04:34.940" style="s2">fish for a variety of different reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.940" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">And I thought, Jesus, what&#39;re you complaining<br />about?</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:40.419" style="s2">I mean, really, do you know what a tuna is<br />like?</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.419" end="00:04:45.670" style="s2">Those things are like small whales, right;<br />they weigh like 600 pounds, they&#39;re impossible</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.670" end="00:04:46.670" style="s2">to catch.</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.670" end="00:04:51.690" style="s2">So there&#39;s some poor characters out there<br />hauling in tuna, which is impossible--and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.690" end="00:04:54.630" style="s2">then they have to clean them and freeze them<br />and smoke them and can them--and all I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.630" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">to do is go to the store and pick up this<br />can of tuna and then I can complain about</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:00.160" style="s2">it for breakfast.</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.160" end="00:05:07.790" style="s2">It&#39;s really quite staggering, the fact that<br />I can ever eat tuna is a complete bloody miracle.</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.790" end="00:05:11.940" style="s2">But it&#39;s not the sort of thing that makes<br />me happy because I just expect that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.940" end="00:05:15.200" style="s2">Which is very pathetic, but that&#39;s how it<br />goes.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.200" end="00:05:17.980" style="s2">So anyways, back to the computer.</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.980" end="00:05:22.940" style="s2">So, it stops working--well, and that&#39;s what<br />I would say I notice the computer.</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.940" end="00:05:26.380" style="s2">And there&#39;s nothing more annoying then noticing<br />a computer when you&#39;re in the middle of writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.380" end="00:05:29.220" style="s2">an essay because, what the hell do you know<br />about computers?</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.220" end="00:05:30.220" style="s2">Nothing.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.220" end="00:05:32.700" style="s2">What&#39;re you going to do?</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.700" end="00:05:33.940" style="s2">Turn it on and off?</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.940" end="00:05:38.320" style="s2">Well that&#39;s like problem solving process number<br />1.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.320" end="00:05:43.890" style="s2">It usually works--thank god--but if it doesn&#39;t<br />work you&#39;re into either the software or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.890" end="00:05:44.890" style="s2">hardware.</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.890" end="00:05:49.480" style="s2">So anyways, I turned it on and off and that<br />didn&#39;t work, and so then I turned on a light</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.480" end="00:05:53.140" style="s2">to see if I could see if something had happened<br />at the back of it.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.140" end="00:05:56.980" style="s2">But the light didn&#39;t go on so I thought, aha,<br />the power probably went out or I blew a fuse,</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.980" end="00:06:01.430" style="s2">so I went out to see if the fuse was burnt<br />out, but it wasn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.430" end="00:06:05.300" style="s2">And then I noticed that all the power in the<br />house was off, and then I noticed that--I</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.300" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">went outside to go to the corner store to<br />get something, I don&#39;t remember what, and</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:11.811" style="s2">when I went outside I noticed that all the<br />streetlights were off.</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.811" end="00:06:16.960" style="s2">And then the entire power grid in Montreal<br />was out.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.960" end="00:06:20.460" style="s2">And then the entire power grid for like half<br />of Quebec was out.</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.460" end="00:06:22.720" style="s2">And a big chunk of Eastern North America.</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.720" end="00:06:23.720" style="s2">And do you know why?</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.720" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">Have I told you this story?</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:27.500" style="s2">Good.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.500" end="00:06:30.090" style="s2">Because there was a solar flare.</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.090" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">And so the sun is a big hydrogen bomb, right.</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">So I don&#39;t know if you guys know this--a cheerful<br />piece of information for you if you need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:40.720" style="s2">be cheered up--but if you happened to have<br />a hydrogen bomb and you exploded it--you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.720" end="00:06:46.140" style="s2">a hydrogen bomb has an atom bomb for its trigger,<br />did you guys know that?</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.140" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">You need to know that because it&#39;s important.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:52.710" style="s2">Because an atom bomb is a big thing, but it&#39;s<br />just a trigger for a hydrogen bomb, so a hydrogen</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.710" end="00:06:56.450" style="s2">bomb is unimaginably bigger than an atom bomb.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.450" end="00:07:00.900" style="s2">Anyways, if you blew a hydrogen bomb in the<br />atmosphere over Central North America, you</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.900" end="00:07:08.430" style="s2">could probably wipe out maybe all of the electronic<br />equipment in the entire continent permanently.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.430" end="00:07:12.560" style="s2">Because what happens is when a hydrogen bomb<br />goes off, there&#39;s an electromagnetic burst,</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.560" end="00:07:17.280" style="s2">and as the propagates it&#39;ll hit your electronic<br />equipment and propagate across the wires and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.280" end="00:07:22.340" style="s2">produce a big spike in current, voltage I<br />think, and it&#39;ll just blow it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.340" end="00:07:27.310" style="s2">So your cars won&#39;t work, your tractors won&#39;t<br />work, your subways won&#39;t work, your cars won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.310" end="00:07:30.640" style="s2">work, your computers won&#39;t work, your satellites<br />won&#39;t work.</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.640" end="00:07:32.030" style="s2">It&#39;s like, done.</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.030" end="00:07:37.590" style="s2">And also, just to cheer you up even more,<br />back in the late 1800s, I think it was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.590" end="00:07:43.580" style="s2">1860s, there was this--oh let&#39;s go back to<br />the sun.</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.580" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">So the sun&#39;s a big hydrogen bomb and now and<br />then it freaks out and emits a big solar flare,</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:51.490" style="s2">which is something that&#39;s gone wrong on the<br />sun.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.490" end="00:08:01.450" style="s2">And maybe it blows out this solar flare almost<br />to the orbit of mercury, and then that burst</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.450" end="00:08:06.570" style="s2">of radiation comes zooming towards earth and<br />then 9 minutes later it hits and, if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.570" end="00:08:11.190" style="s2">a decent electromagnetic pulse it&#39;ll wipe<br />out the power grid in Quebec.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.190" end="00:08:12.520" style="s2">And that&#39;s what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.520" end="00:08:17.130" style="s2">So the reason my computer didn&#39;t work is because<br />the sun was misbehaving.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.130" end="00:08:18.780" style="s2">And so, I like that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.780" end="00:08:22.840" style="s2">It was very illuminating to me because it<br />just shows you how many things need to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.840" end="00:08:28.530" style="s2">stacked on top of each other, working perfectly<br />for some thing that you&#39;re doing to actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.530" end="00:08:29.530" style="s2">function.</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.530" end="00:08:34.419" style="s2">So anyways, back in the late 1800s in the<br />1860s, there was a massive solar flare and</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.419" end="00:08:41.010" style="s2">it produced a bust of power on telegraph lines<br />and it lit some telegraph operators on fire.</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.010" end="00:08:44.670" style="s2">And so this does happen--it happens about<br />once a century, and we just missed one last</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.670" end="00:08:45.700" style="s2">year.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.700" end="00:08:52.010" style="s2">So while you&#39;re worrying about global warming<br />you can be considering the much higher probability</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.010" end="00:08:55.829" style="s2">that a solar flare will knock out all of our<br />electronics and send us back to like 1860.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.829" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">So the point is that, first of all, there&#39;s<br />a lot of things going on to make up an object</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:05.670" style="s2">that you don&#39;t detect with your vision.</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.670" end="00:09:11.540" style="s2">You never think that the reason the computer<br />works is because the sun is acting properly.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.540" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">But it is of course the case that endless<br />number of things have to be stabilized that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.120" end="00:09:18.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t see.</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.120" end="00:09:22.590" style="s2">And you might say, well the sun isn&#39;t part<br />of the computer but well, that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.590" end="00:09:26.890" style="s2">It&#39;s not part of the computer in some sense<br />when it&#39;s behaving, but as soon as it stops</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.890" end="00:09:29.520" style="s2">behaving it&#39;s instantly part of the computer.</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.520" end="00:09:36.490" style="s2">So here we&#39;ve got--you might say, well let&#39;s<br />say the power hadn&#39;t gone out and the computer</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.490" end="00:09:37.490" style="s2">stopped working.</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.490" end="00:09:42.680" style="s2">Well then you might think, well I&#39;ll never<br />buy that brand again.</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.680" end="00:09:51.140" style="s2">And maybe the brand is associated with operation<br />in some country where corruption is rife and</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.140" end="00:09:53.700" style="s2">things are made improperly and the parts don&#39;t<br />work very well.</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.700" end="00:09:55.900" style="s2">So you might think, well I made a stupid purchase<br />decision.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.900" end="00:10:01.340" style="s2">And of course that&#39;s connected to the political<br />system of that place and the economy.</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.340" end="00:10:06.050" style="s2">And then weird little things can happen down<br />at the micro level as well as the macro level.</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.050" end="00:10:12.650" style="s2">So computer chips have now got so small--you<br />know they have little wires in them right,</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.650" end="00:10:16.270" style="s2">the chips--the wires are now so small that<br />because of quantum uncertainty.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.270" end="00:10:20.890" style="s2">So quantum uncertainty basically tells you<br />that you can&#39;t really tell where an electron</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.890" end="00:10:23.130" style="s2">is if you want to know how fast it&#39;s going.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">And you can&#39;t tell how fast it&#39;s going if<br />you want to know where it is.</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:30.290" style="s2">But more than that it says you can&#39;t really<br />know where the thing is, and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.290" end="00:10:33.690" style="s2">means is that once you get your wire short<br />enough, some of the electrons might not be</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.690" end="00:10:38.150" style="s2">in the wires where they&#39;re supposed to be,<br />and they actually cause short circuits.</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.150" end="00:10:40.170" style="s2">So that&#39;s another issue.</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.170" end="00:10:43.779" style="s2">There&#39;s other levels of reality that are micro<br />levels that you can&#39;t detect at all.</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.779" end="00:10:47.960" style="s2">So there&#39;s macro levels that are way beyond<br />you, you know, political systems, economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.960" end="00:10:51.800" style="s2">systems, biological systems, physical systems<br />outside of that.</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.800" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">And then there are these Microsystems layered<br />all the way down, and things can go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:01.870" style="s2">at any one of those levels and a lot of that<br />is invisible to us.</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.870" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">The same thing happens when something goes<br />wrong with you.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:07.650" style="s2">It&#39;s like, what&#39;s wrong with you?</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.650" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">Maybe you&#39;re malfunctioning at the molecular<br />level.</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:13.370" style="s2">Your DNA isn&#39;t working properly so you get<br />cancer.</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.370" end="00:11:19.080" style="s2">Or maybe some virus which is even smaller<br />than the DNA comes in and takes up residence</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.080" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s really not so good.</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.810" style="s2">Or maybe you&#39;re eating something wrong and<br />you have an organ malfunction.</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.810" end="00:11:29.340" style="s2">Or maybe your family&#39;s screwed up and you&#39;re<br />stressed half to death and the reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.340" end="00:11:36.060" style="s2">screwed up is because you live in, let&#39;s say<br />a society that&#39;s not friendly to your particular</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.060" end="00:11:41.370" style="s2">immigrant type, and so the real reason that<br />you&#39;re sick is because of people&#39;s inability</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.370" end="00:11:42.670" style="s2">to get along with one another.</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.670" end="00:11:45.050" style="s2">And so on and so forth and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.050" end="00:11:48.830" style="s2">And so god only knows where you&#39;re supposed<br />to focus.</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.830" end="00:11:51.620" style="s2">But, focus we do.</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.620" end="00:11:59.191" style="s2">And one of the things that motivation allows<br />you to do is to figure out what you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.191" end="00:12:00.191" style="s2">to focus on.</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.191" end="00:12:05.650" style="s2">Now you think, god, there&#39;s all these things<br />to focus on.</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.650" end="00:12:09.270" style="s2">There&#39;s an infinite number of things to focus<br />on.</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.270" end="00:12:16.220" style="s2">How in the world do you ever figure out how<br />to focus on anything?</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.220" end="00:12:23.280" style="s2">Well the answer to that is evolution, fundamentally.</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.280" end="00:12:25.660" style="s2">You can view evolution in the following way.</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.660" end="00:12:31.130" style="s2">You can kind of think about the background<br />of reality--I think the best way to think</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.130" end="00:12:36.510" style="s2">about it is as this interplay of patterns,<br />complex patterns sort of like music.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:41.160" style="s2">And those patterns are always changing in<br />a sort of dynamic way, and they exist at multiple</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.160" end="00:12:43.600" style="s2">levels, just like complex music does.</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.600" end="00:12:50.279" style="s2">So then imagine that what you&#39;re trying to<br />do is to dance to the music, to align yourself</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.279" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">to the music.</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:54.080" style="s2">And it keeps changing on you so, well, what<br />do you do?</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.080" end="00:12:58.120" style="s2">Well if you can change then you can change<br />the music.</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.120" end="00:13:01.030" style="s2">But if you can&#39;t change then that&#39;s it.</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.030" end="00:13:02.190" style="s2">You&#39;re not dancing anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.190" end="00:13:05.750" style="s2">Okay, so let&#39;s assume that there&#39;s two ways<br />of solving that problem.</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.750" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">One way is just sheer number.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:13.300" style="s2">You&#39;re a single celled organism or a mosquito<br />and you don&#39;t have that much neurocapacity</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.300" end="00:13:17.170" style="s2">for transformation and so you don&#39;t know what<br />the melody is going to be when you lay your</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.170" end="00:13:23.339" style="s2">eggs if you&#39;re a mosquito and so you produce<br />like a million eggs and some of them can dance</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.339" end="00:13:27.110" style="s2">to the current beat and the others can&#39;t,<br />and so they all die.</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.110" end="00:13:30.860" style="s2">And so that&#39;s what happens over the course<br />of evolution for a very very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.860" end="00:13:36.839" style="s2">The melody keeps changing and then what creatures<br />do is propagate a whole variety of variants</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.839" end="00:13:43.320" style="s2">of themselves, and in the case of small animals<br />or fish even or crayfish or that sort of thing,</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.320" end="00:13:48.600" style="s2">they just overproduce offspring like mad in<br />hope that one of them can dance to the current</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.600" end="00:13:49.740" style="s2">tune.</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.740" end="00:13:53.520" style="s2">And then you know, we get three and a half<br />billion years later, roughly speaking, here</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">we all are and what we&#39;ve got is this dynamic<br />nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.440" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">And it enables us to take an external pattern<br />and map it to a neurological pattern, or multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:10.050" style="s2">neurological patterns--because we can interpret<br />things, right--and then to output that to</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.050" end="00:14:11.640" style="s2">multiple behavioural patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.640" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">And so in some sense, what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;re<br />internalised the process of evolutionary variation</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:19.410" style="s2">into ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.410" end="00:14:24.240" style="s2">And the more complex, roughly speaking, the<br />more layers your nervous system has--imagine</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.240" end="00:14:29.540" style="s2">there&#39;s a pattern on your skin, and then that&#39;s<br />interpreted by a pattern of nerves, and then</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.540" end="00:14:34.040" style="s2">those nerves have an output, they&#39;re sensory<br />nerves we&#39;ll say, and then those have an output</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.040" end="00:14:36.810" style="s2">to motor nerves, and then those have an output<br />to muscles.</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.810" end="00:14:38.540" style="s2">That&#39;s you, roughly.</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:41.630" style="s2">You&#39;re maybe a four-layer thing in that regard.</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.630" end="00:14:47.030" style="s2">But then you grow all these extra layers of<br />neural tissue, so that the layers are hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.030" end="00:14:49.450" style="s2">of cells thick.</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.450" end="00:14:50.450" style="s2">Hundreds of layers thick.</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.450" end="00:14:55.820" style="s2">And then you can map a whole bunch of patterns<br />in the external world onto a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.820" end="00:15:00.040" style="s2">patterns in the neural world and then onto<br />a whole bunch of patterns in the motor world,</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.040" end="00:15:03.420" style="s2">and so that makes you dynamically adaptable.</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.420" end="00:15:08.550" style="s2">But you learned all that through this incredibly<br />painful process of evolution which basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.550" end="00:15:15.060" style="s2">consisted of the death of like 99.999 percent<br />of everything that ever lived.</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.060" end="00:15:17.800" style="s2">Species and individuals alike.</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.800" end="00:15:21.010" style="s2">Now, why is that relevant?</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.010" end="00:15:23.970" style="s2">Well, how do you figure out how to focus in<br />on something?</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.970" end="00:15:31.470" style="s2">Well, a big part of that is actually--let&#39;s<br />see how we do it.</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.470" end="00:15:34.110" style="s2">Well first of all, what are you focusing in<br />on here?</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.110" end="00:15:37.780" style="s2">Well not poisonous snakes, and rampaging lions<br />and chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.780" end="00:15:39.600" style="s2">Because they&#39;re not in here.</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.600" end="00:15:44.200" style="s2">And the reason they&#39;re not in here, roughly<br />speaking, is because you live in a culture</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.200" end="00:15:47.750" style="s2">that&#39;s very very highly advanced and it&#39;s<br />got walls like mad.</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.750" end="00:15:51.000" style="s2">This is a--Carcassonne I think, a French city,<br />medieval city.</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.000" end="00:15:52.060" style="s2">It still exists.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.060" end="00:15:53.230" style="s2">Beautiful city.</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.230" end="00:15:55.420" style="s2">You see how the medieval people solved this<br />problem.</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.420" end="00:15:57.470" style="s2">It&#39;s like, well you can&#39;t deal with much.</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.470" end="00:15:58.470" style="s2">Well what do you do?</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.470" end="00:16:00.279" style="s2">Build some walls, keep a bunch of stuff out.</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.279" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to worry about the rampaging<br />barbarians then because they just can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:05.160" style="s2">in.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.160" end="00:16:09.450" style="s2">And so a lot of the reason that you can handle<br />the insane complexity of the world is because</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.450" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not even neurological.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:13.899" style="s2">It has virtually nothing to do with your physiology.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.899" end="00:16:19.220" style="s2">It&#39;s just that you&#39;re in a university.</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.220" end="00:16:23.740" style="s2">And the university is protected by the city<br />and the city is protected by the province</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.740" end="00:16:28.140" style="s2">and the province is protected by the country<br />and the country is protected by all of its</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.140" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">multiple entanglements.</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:34.950" style="s2">You&#39;re inside walls inside walls inside walls<br />inside walls and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.950" end="00:16:36.459" style="s2">Your world&#39;s pretty simple.</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.459" end="00:16:40.770" style="s2">You can just sit there in relative warmth<br />and comfort and not have to worry about anything.</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.770" end="00:16:44.089" style="s2">And so there&#39;s one solution: there&#39;s a cultural<br />solution.</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.089" end="00:16:48.550" style="s2">Then inside the cultural solution obviously<br />there&#39;s architectural solutions of various</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.550" end="00:16:49.740" style="s2">sorts.</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.740" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">And then there&#39;s political and economic institutions<br />that are pretty stable, and they keep you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:55.339" style="s2">from having to deal with chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.339" end="00:17:00.700" style="s2">I mean you can see that chaos breaking out<br />a little bit in the previous weeks, in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.700" end="00:17:01.720" style="s2">American election.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.720" end="00:17:06.659" style="s2">Because the trump people and the left wingers<br />are going at it at the Trump rallies.</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.659" end="00:17:12.309" style="s2">And you can see that&#39;s just tinder, that could<br />just blow up at any point and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.309" end="00:17:17.529" style="s2">protection that&#39;s there because all of these<br />very complex games that we&#39;ve agreed to play--like</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.529" end="00:17:21.339" style="s2">the democracy game--that just all flies by<br />the wayside.</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.339" end="00:17:25.029" style="s2">And all of a sudden you have to contend with<br />what people are like, and that is not something</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.029" end="00:17:26.360" style="s2">you want to do.</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.360" end="00:17:30.779" style="s2">There&#39;s people, man--they&#39;re capable of anything.</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.779" end="00:17:33.130" style="s2">Which is good, but also really bad.</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.130" end="00:17:36.280" style="s2">Well then the next thing is, you&#39;ve got a<br />body.</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.280" end="00:17:38.700" style="s2">Now that&#39;s where the evolutionary process<br />really kicks in.</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.700" end="00:17:45.929" style="s2">And so the reason your body is the way it<br />is, roughly speaking, is because it&#39;s mimicked</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.929" end="00:17:47.510" style="s2">the external environment.</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.510" end="00:17:53.060" style="s2">Just like Piaget talks about children using<br />their bodies to mimic the external environment</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.060" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">voluntarily, you know, your body is set up<br />through this evolutionary process so that</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:03.840" style="s2">you can focus on precisely that subset of<br />things that seems to keep something like you</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:08.090" style="s2">going for long enough for you to make another<br />one of something that&#39;s more or less like</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.090" end="00:18:09.390" style="s2">you.</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.390" end="00:18:12.929" style="s2">And it only really works for about a hundred<br />years.</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.929" end="00:18:15.120" style="s2">That&#39;s pretty much where it tops out.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:17.630" style="s2">And so you don&#39;t solve the problem very well.</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.630" end="00:18:21.680" style="s2">You don&#39;t solve the problem of radical complexity<br />very well.</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.680" end="00:18:27.010" style="s2">But you solve it well enough so that you live<br />long enough to reproduce, speaking strictly</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.010" end="00:18:28.010" style="s2">biologically.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.010" end="00:18:30.150" style="s2">And that appears to be good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.150" end="00:18:35.750" style="s2">And part of the reason why you seem to expire,<br />because you might think, well if I--why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.750" end="00:18:39.550" style="s2">people just live for like 500 years instead<br />of 100 years?</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.550" end="00:18:46.870" style="s2">Because you&#39;d think that someone who could<br />continue to reproduce for 200 years instead</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.870" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">of 100 years would have it all over for someone<br />who could only manage it for 50 years, say.</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:57.929" style="s2">Turns out that your genes have a better time<br />of it if you just put them into a new body</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.929" end="00:19:01.681" style="s2">and shuffle off this mortal coil so you&#39;re<br />not using up too many resources while your</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.681" end="00:19:05.350" style="s2">children and grandchildren are trying to survive.</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.350" end="00:19:09.850" style="s2">And so that&#39;s an evolutionary solution.</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.850" end="00:19:12.390" style="s2">Death is not technically inevitable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.390" end="00:19:14.690" style="s2">There are creatures that are roughly immortal.</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.690" end="00:19:17.390" style="s2">Goldfish, for example, which is really annoying.</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.390" end="00:19:19.000" style="s2">It&#39;s like, really?</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.000" end="00:19:20.000" style="s2">Goldfish?</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.000" end="00:19:23.680" style="s2">Because they&#39;re a carp and carp basically<br />just keep growing.</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.680" end="00:19:29.530" style="s2">It isn&#39;t obvious that they senesce or age--they<br />get killed because they get diseases and these</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.530" end="00:19:34.340" style="s2">sort of thing, but there are 300 or 400 year<br />old carp.</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.340" end="00:19:37.770" style="s2">And some turtles seem to not age really.</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.770" end="00:19:44.650" style="s2">And then of course your DNA has been there<br />ever since life started, so it doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.650" end="00:19:45.880" style="s2">age either.</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.880" end="00:19:47.900" style="s2">And it corrects itself.</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.900" end="00:19:50.180" style="s2">So things can last a very very long time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.180" end="00:19:51.880" style="s2">But not us.</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.880" end="00:19:57.370" style="s2">Anyways, we&#39;re put inside this body that frames<br />things for us and starts narrowing things</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.370" end="00:19:58.370" style="s2">down.</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.370" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">And our psychophysiological selves have a<br />limited range of interests and desires and</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:10.610" style="s2">needs--however you want to construe that--and<br />then that gets instantiated more into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.610" end="00:20:12.660" style="s2">nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.660" end="00:20:15.870" style="s2">It&#39;s a mistake to think--people always think<br />your brain is in your head, and that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.870" end="00:20:17.720" style="s2">not a very bright way of thinking about it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.720" end="00:20:22.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t know exactly why we think that way<br />because, well there&#39;s the nervous system--you</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.520" end="00:20:24.800" style="s2">can see it right there.</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.800" end="00:20:29.179" style="s2">There&#39;s a lot of your nervous system that&#39;s<br />not in your head.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.179" end="00:20:32.600" style="s2">The motor and sensory systems are distributed<br />throughout your body.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.600" end="00:20:37.820" style="s2">Your spine is smart enough so that if it gets<br />severed and we put you over top of a treadmill--suspend</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.820" end="00:20:39.400" style="s2">you--you can walk.</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.400" end="00:20:42.770" style="s2">You don&#39;t know you&#39;re walking and you can&#39;t<br />control it, but your legs will do a perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.770" end="00:20:46.110" style="s2">good job of walking without you being involved<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.110" end="00:20:49.880" style="s2">So your spine is brain tissue for all intents<br />and purposes.</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.880" end="00:20:52.760" style="s2">Your brain is distributed through your body.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.760" end="00:21:00.530" style="s2">And so, it&#39;s evolved so that it&#39;s pretty good<br />at going around specifying what it needs.</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.530" end="00:21:11.930" style="s2">And so we talked about the hypothalamus the<br />other day and how it accounts for what I called</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.930" end="00:21:15.980" style="s2">sub-personalities that are motivated towards<br />particular ends.</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.980" end="00:21:21.430" style="s2">And those ends are obviously the things that<br />we would identify as fundamental biological</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.430" end="00:21:23.360" style="s2">necessities.</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.360" end="00:21:30.049" style="s2">But then they transform themselves as we interact<br />socially into more and more complex fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.049" end="00:21:33.330" style="s2">biological necessities.</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.330" end="00:21:38.450" style="s2">It&#39;s a tricky thing because people talk about<br />needs as if they&#39;re biologically instantiated,</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.450" end="00:21:41.500" style="s2">like they&#39;re the fundamental building elements<br />of motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.500" end="00:21:47.880" style="s2">But it&#39;s not really that obvious, because<br />you might say, well being hungry is a biological</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.880" end="00:21:50.510" style="s2">need but being a doctor isn&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.510" end="00:21:56.070" style="s2">Well, not really because if you do end up<br />being a physician you pretty much solve the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.070" end="00:21:58.830" style="s2">food acquisition problem permanently, right.</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.830" end="00:22:02.510" style="s2">So it&#39;s just a higher order manifestation<br />of the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.510" end="00:22:06.929" style="s2">And it&#39;s higher order because instead of just<br />eating once you eat every day for the next</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.929" end="00:22:07.929" style="s2">40 years.</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.929" end="00:22:11.610" style="s2">And instead of just feeding you, you feed<br />you and your family and maybe some other people</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.610" end="00:22:12.610" style="s2">too.</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.610" end="00:22:17.130" style="s2">So, thinking of that as something that isn&#39;t<br />rooted in biologically is not accurate.</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.130" end="00:22:21.880" style="s2">It&#39;s kind of a continuous complexification.</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.880" end="00:22:31.510" style="s2">From the simple local time-bound immature<br />subpersonalities that can only fulfill themselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.510" end="00:22:36.630" style="s2">in this moment and with help, to the development<br />of those circuits--which I would say is your</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.630" end="00:22:41.500" style="s2">personality--that are capable of providing<br />you with what you need in order to live and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.500" end="00:22:44.820" style="s2">to be attracted to other people across very<br />large spans of time.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.820" end="00:22:45.960" style="s2">It&#39;s like a tree, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.960" end="00:22:48.210" style="s2">It&#39;s a like a tree expanding upward.</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.210" end="00:22:51.690" style="s2">It&#39;s a good metaphor.</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.690" end="00:22:54.970" style="s2">Alright, so that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.970" end="00:22:58.240" style="s2">Motivation sets up your perceptual frame.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.240" end="00:23:03.820" style="s2">And so people often talk about motivation<br />as if it&#39;s a drive or a need--not as if those</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.820" end="00:23:05.870" style="s2">terms are particularly well-defined.</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.870" end="00:23:11.720" style="s2">A drive I suppose is a deterministic sequence<br />of motor outputs, something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.720" end="00:23:18.309" style="s2">But it&#39;s not accurate because the motivation<br />actually specifies what you look at.</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.309" end="00:23:21.809" style="s2">It specifies right what you see.</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.809" end="00:23:27.380" style="s2">And then it specifies as well what you&#39;re<br />going to respond to emotionally.</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.380" end="00:23:34.000" style="s2">So just imagine this, say I&#39;d offered a 10,000<br />dollar prize to the person who counts the</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.000" end="00:23:36.610" style="s2">number of basketballs correctly.</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.610" end="00:23:41.340" style="s2">And then you&#39;re doing your best to count the<br />number of basketballs in the monkey illusion</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.340" end="00:23:45.500" style="s2">and then somebody stands up in front of you<br />like this, and blocks your view.</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.500" end="00:23:48.670" style="s2">Well what emotion are you going to feel?</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.670" end="00:23:50.929" style="s2">It&#39;s a negative emotion, right?</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.929" end="00:23:51.929" style="s2">In all likelihood.</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.929" end="00:23:55.640" style="s2">And so that might be anxiety, because you&#39;re<br />not going to win.</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.640" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">It might be fear--it&#39;s like anxiety because<br />you&#39;re not going to win, but also like--fear</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">because what the hell is this crazy person<br />doing.</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:05.480" style="s2">Anger.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.480" end="00:24:10.340" style="s2">Right, that&#39;s another negative emotion, although<br />there&#39;s a positive attack element to it.</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.340" end="00:24:17.590" style="s2">Frustration, disappointment, maybe some grief--a<br />whole undifferentiated mess of negative emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.590" end="00:24:18.590" style="s2">Well why?</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.590" end="00:24:27.480" style="s2">Well, in some sense the motivational system<br />specifies the map and the goal.</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.480" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">It&#39;s a little more complicated than that because<br />it also specifies where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:33.410" style="s2">But you can think about it as a map with a<br />destination.</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.410" end="00:24:37.929" style="s2">That&#39;s why stories are like that, because<br />we inhabit them.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.929" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">A map&#39;s like that all the time.</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">And then what emotions do, roughly speaking,<br />is tell you whether or not things are going</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.380" style="s2">the way you want them to as you&#39;re on that<br />path.</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.380" end="00:24:57.530" style="s2">And so the emotions in some sense have to<br />have a motivational specification before they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.530" end="00:24:58.530" style="s2">properly functional.</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.530" end="00:25:00.530" style="s2">Like, what should you get angry at.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.530" end="00:25:05.390" style="s2">Well generally you get angry at things that<br />either interfere with your progression towards</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.390" end="00:25:13.710" style="s2">a valued goal or upset the entire sub-personality<br />that contains the goal itself.</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.710" end="00:25:21.549" style="s2">That&#39;s a more--what could you call it--that&#39;s<br />a more serious failure.</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.549" end="00:25:25.419" style="s2">It&#39;s one to fail when you&#39;re trying to do<br />something, it&#39;s another thing to fail so hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.419" end="00:25:27.590" style="s2">you have to give up the whole project.</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.590" end="00:25:31.530" style="s2">We would rather just fail at some sub-element<br />than have to give up the whole project, right.</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.530" end="00:25:37.160" style="s2">It&#39;s one thing to fail an exam, it&#39;s another<br />thing to fail at university.</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.160" end="00:25:42.410" style="s2">And I think the reason for that--I thought<br />about that for a long time--why is it worse</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.410" end="00:25:46.310" style="s2">to fail out of university, assuming you want<br />to be in university, than it is to fail an</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.310" end="00:25:47.310" style="s2">exam?</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.310" end="00:25:49.580" style="s2">How does your brain compute that?</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.580" end="00:25:53.650" style="s2">Because you can&#39;t tell all the consequences,<br />right, so it&#39;s not self evident.</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.650" end="00:26:02.000" style="s2">But it seems to me that it&#39;s something like,<br />you think about these functional sub-personalities</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:08.670" style="s2">as having a temporal and spatial range of<br />application.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.670" end="00:26:12.730" style="s2">So if you&#39;re a university student you&#39;re sort<br />of stabilized for four years.</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.730" end="00:26:17.289" style="s2">Wherever you go, people say &quot;what do you do?&quot;<br />and you can say &quot;I’m a university student.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.289" end="00:26:21.350" style="s2">And everybody&#39;s happy about that.</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.350" end="00:26:27.380" style="s2">From an economic perspective it&#39;s probably<br />worse than being unemployed, in some sense,</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.380" end="00:26:31.410" style="s2">but you can&#39;t just go tell people that you&#39;re<br />unemployed and then you have a nice little</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.410" end="00:26:32.919" style="s2">high-status slot in society.</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.919" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.770" style="s2">But you can do that as a university student,<br />you know, so it fulfills your social obligations</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.770" end="00:26:43.250" style="s2">and it makes you feel like you&#39;re doing something<br />at least vaguely useful--I mean apart from</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.250" end="00:26:45.490" style="s2">the learning and all the other things that<br />are positive about it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.490" end="00:26:51.870" style="s2">So what happens is that that map basically<br />covers that space and time--the time is four</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.870" end="00:26:55.110" style="s2">years and the space is everywhere you go during<br />those four years.</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.110" end="00:27:00.910" style="s2">Then if that map burns up it&#39;s like you&#39;re<br />exposed on all fronts for that entire four</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.910" end="00:27:01.910" style="s2">year period.</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.910" end="00:27:05.780" style="s2">And that might even be the two years previously.</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.780" end="00:27:11.090" style="s2">For example--strange to think that, but if<br />you bail out of university half way through</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.090" end="00:27:18.500" style="s2">your third year, you&#39;ve also destructured<br />the map that you used to organize your memories,</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.500" end="00:27:21.130" style="s2">in some sense, of the previous two and a half<br />years.</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.130" end="00:27:24.740" style="s2">Because first of all they were the memories<br />of somewone who was doing just fine and going</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.740" end="00:27:28.270" style="s2">through university, and now all of a sudden<br />they&#39;re the memories of someone who failed.</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.270" end="00:27:30.350" style="s2">Those aren&#39;t the same memories.</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.350" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">And so it&#39;s weird that an error can alter<br />the past, but it can and often does.</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:43.740" style="s2">I mean any relationship breakup that&#39;s of<br />any significance will do exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.740" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">thing, especially if you were betrayed, right.</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.789" style="s2">It&#39;s like, it&#39;s not just the present and the<br />future that dissolve into chaos and take you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.789" end="00:27:52.429" style="s2">on a little trip to the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.429" end="00:27:58.070" style="s2">It&#39;s also your revision--the necessity of<br />revising your past.</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.070" end="00:28:03.169" style="s2">So anyways, so then I would say well--failing<br />a class--well the class restructures you in</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.169" end="00:28:08.200" style="s2">some sense and focuses you for a certain subset<br />of the general going-to-university map.</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.200" end="00:28:14.090" style="s2">So it&#39;s going to be less traumatizing to do<br />poorly on a class than it is to fail out of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.090" end="00:28:21.260" style="s2">university because the amount of space and<br />time that those respective maps covers differs.</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.260" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">So what you&#39;re trying to do always is to lay<br />out a functional game--that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.309" style="s2">thinking about it--on the space-time territory<br />that you inhabit.</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.309" end="00:28:36.960" style="s2">And if you understand that then you can start<br />to understand a little bit about emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.960" end="00:28:45.750" style="s2">Now, okay, I have to put a little coda in<br />there and that&#39;s: motivations and emotions</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.750" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">are not technical terms.</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:50.100" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of like id and ego.</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.100" end="00:28:54.250" style="s2">They&#39;re terms that you can use to structure<br />a debate.</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.250" end="00:28:57.420" style="s2">I showed you the hypothalamus and you see<br />it&#39;s made out of all those little nuclei--they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.420" end="00:29:01.370" style="s2">not the same, so you can&#39;t say that every<br />part of the hypothalamus is doing something</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.370" end="00:29:04.880" style="s2">that you can fit into a class: motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.880" end="00:29:12.350" style="s2">And motivations and emotions overlap, so,<br />I would say hunger--some of them oversee more</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.350" end="00:29:15.450" style="s2">purely motivation.</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.450" end="00:29:21.309" style="s2">If you have an unsettling altercation with<br />someone, it tends not to make you hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.309" end="00:29:26.909" style="s2">Whereas it might make you angry, it might<br />make you happy, it might make you sad.</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.909" end="00:29:32.120" style="s2">So hunger is something that seems to pop up<br />one of these maps and then emotions guide</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.120" end="00:29:35.100" style="s2">your way through it or tell you where you<br />are on it.</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.100" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">But then you have complex motivation-emotions<br />like pain, and also anger.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:45.140" style="s2">Because pain has a goal in it, right--get<br />away.</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.140" end="00:29:50.309" style="s2">Or stop, or get away--it&#39;s usually get away--but<br />it also has an emotional feeling, right.</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.309" end="00:29:51.789" style="s2">It feels bad.</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.789" end="00:29:54.559" style="s2">So it feels like an emotion, pain.</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.559" end="00:29:56.669" style="s2">Grief is like pain.</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.669" end="00:29:58.490" style="s2">Disappointment is like pain.</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.490" end="00:30:01.770" style="s2">Loneliness is like pain.</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.770" end="00:30:05.860" style="s2">And I mean this technically--all of those<br />things can be addressed rather successfully</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.860" end="00:30:07.350" style="s2">with opiates, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.350" end="00:30:09.250" style="s2">So technically they&#39;re the same.</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.250" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">But pain--is being hurt an emotion?</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:16.360" style="s2">Well people will say that, &quot;well I feel hurt.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.360" end="00:30:17.360" style="s2">Whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.360" end="00:30:24.500" style="s2">And anger is another one of those that&#39;s sort<br />of ambivalent because anger has a goal, right:</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.500" end="00:30:26.280" style="s2">remove obstacle.</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.280" end="00:30:27.360" style="s2">Remove or destroy obstacle.</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.360" end="00:30:29.430" style="s2">In a sense, that&#39;s the goal of anger.</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.430" end="00:30:32.289" style="s2">But people talk about it as an emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.289" end="00:30:34.520" style="s2">So we&#39;re oversimplifying.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.520" end="00:30:39.190" style="s2">But it doesn&#39;t matter because it&#39;s a useful<br />oversimplification and that&#39;s sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.190" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">a theory is: a useful oversimplification.</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:49.799" style="s2">Alright, so <br />I kind of laid out what I think are the basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.799" end="00:30:51.830" style="s2">motivations there.</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.830" end="00:31:00.140" style="s2">Hunger, thirst, pain, anger, thermoregulation--you<br />don&#39;t want to be too hot or too cold--panic</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.140" end="00:31:07.480" style="s2">or escape, affiliation or care, sexual desire,<br />exploration, play.</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.480" end="00:31:12.909" style="s2">And you can kind of divide those into self-maintenance<br />motivations and self-propagation motivations,</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.909" end="00:31:15.110" style="s2">roughly speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.110" end="00:31:16.850" style="s2">Sort of just a way to keep track of them.</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.850" end="00:31:20.070" style="s2">And then emotions--so the hypothalamus is<br />involved in a lot of that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.070" end="00:31:24.590" style="s2">It&#39;s not the only thing but it&#39;s involved<br />in a lot of that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.590" end="00:31:27.790" style="s2">And so here&#39;s sort of how I&#39;ve conceptualized<br />one of these maps.</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.790" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">And we&#39;ve seen this thing before.</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:35.400" style="s2">You&#39;re at point A because if you&#39;re using<br />a map, or if you&#39;re in a game, there&#39;s a starting</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.400" end="00:31:40.570" style="s2">point or you&#39;re a player--either way there&#39;s<br />you there--and then you&#39;re going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.570" end="00:31:42.409" style="s2">and you have to do something to get there.</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.409" end="00:31:45.380" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s the little map, and maybe<br />you have to go make a peanut butter sandwich</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.380" end="00:31:49.409" style="s2">or you have to go turn the thermostat down<br />or you need to call your friend or whatever.</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.409" end="00:31:55.070" style="s2">But it&#39;s the same kind of structure that you&#39;re<br />using in all those different situations.</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.070" end="00:31:56.799" style="s2">And they switch, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.799" end="00:31:58.679" style="s2">Now you&#39;re finished being hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.679" end="00:32:00.549" style="s2">Now you&#39;re thirsty.</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.549" end="00:32:02.419" style="s2">Then you&#39;re lonesome.</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.419" end="00:32:03.900" style="s2">It&#39;s like Sisyphus.</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.900" end="00:32:07.429" style="s2">It&#39;s one damn thing after another, roughly<br />speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.429" end="00:32:08.960" style="s2">And so that&#39;s what keeps you alive.</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.960" end="00:32:12.990" style="s2">And you have to be chasing things all the<br />time because your natural tendency is to run</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.990" end="00:32:15.160" style="s2">out of fuel and decay.</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.160" end="00:32:17.179" style="s2">That&#39;s entropy--you have to fight that.</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.179" end="00:32:21.309" style="s2">And so that&#39;s a continual battle because you&#39;re<br />pretty organized and it&#39;s really hard for</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.309" end="00:32:25.390" style="s2">something that organized to just stay organized.</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.390" end="00:32:28.830" style="s2">It&#39;s a lot easier--there&#39;s a million ways<br />to mess up your room.</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.830" end="00:32:30.340" style="s2">There&#39;s like one way to clean it.</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.340" end="00:32:33.340" style="s2">Or maybe 10, you get the point.</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.340" end="00:32:37.010" style="s2">And it&#39;s the same with anything that&#39;s extraordinarily<br />complex.</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.010" end="00:32:41.770" style="s2">There&#39;s not that many ways it can stay in<br />order and there&#39;s a lot of ways it can fall</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.770" end="00:32:42.770" style="s2">apart.</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.770" end="00:32:43.940" style="s2">That&#39;s why you&#39;re running all the time on<br />a treadmill.</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.940" end="00:32:47.360" style="s2">You&#39;re fighting the second--is it the second<br />law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.360" end="00:32:49.240" style="s2">Is entropy the second law of thermodynamics?</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.240" end="00:32:50.460" style="s2">I think so.</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.460" end="00:32:54.409" style="s2">That&#39;s a major one, so good luck in your scrap.</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.409" end="00:33:00.750" style="s2">Because you&#39;re going to need it.</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.750" end="00:33:06.570" style="s2">So these little underlying biological systems<br />pop up the primary maps and then those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.570" end="00:33:09.530" style="s2">elaborated upwards into maps that are more<br />and more complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.530" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">And the more and more complicated maps maybe<br />solve two problems at the same time for a</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.440" end="00:33:14.440" style="s2">week.</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.440" end="00:33:17.529" style="s2">Or they solve 10 problems at the same time<br />for 20 years.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.529" end="00:33:23.700" style="s2">That&#39;s why you want a job or a career: a whole<br />bunch of problems are solved immediately as</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.700" end="00:33:25.510" style="s2">soon as you&#39;re employed.</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.510" end="00:33:31.559" style="s2">I mean, you have some other problems, but<br />that&#39;s inescapable anyways.</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.559" end="00:33:34.560" style="s2">Okay so you&#39;re inside one of these so you&#39;re<br />always motivated.</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.560" end="00:33:36.340" style="s2">You&#39;re always running around after something.</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.340" end="00:33:42.210" style="s2">And that&#39;s another thing to know too because<br />the basic state of human beings is not quiescence,</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.210" end="00:33:43.210" style="s2">you know.</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.210" end="00:33:45.860" style="s2">You&#39;re not napping in front of a fireplace.</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.860" end="00:33:50.710" style="s2">If you&#39;re not pursuing something that you&#39;re<br />motivated to pursue, then generally what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.710" end="00:33:54.950" style="s2">doing if figuring out how to pursue other<br />things that you&#39;re motivated to pursue.</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.950" end="00:33:55.950" style="s2">And that&#39;s exploration.</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.950" end="00:34:02.000" style="s2">And so if you&#39;re not actively motivated by<br />biological necessity, we&#39;ll say for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.000" end="00:34:07.880" style="s2">of simplicity, then the next motivation kicks<br />in, which is well, prepare for the next time</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.880" end="00:34:09.820" style="s2">that you are so motivated.</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.820" end="00:34:12.129" style="s2">And that really accounts for our capacity<br />to explore.</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.129" end="00:34:16.360" style="s2">We&#39;re always zooming around the world trying<br />to figure out what to do with it next, you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.360" end="00:34:17.360" style="s2">know.</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.360" end="00:34:21.429" style="s2">Acquiring more information or--even when we&#39;re<br />entertaining ourselves because we&#39;re almost</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.429" end="00:34:23.839" style="s2">always looking at stories when we entertain<br />ourselves.</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.839" end="00:34:28.849" style="s2">We&#39;re still acquiring information that has<br />functional significance and so attractive</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.849" end="00:34:34.119" style="s2">to us that we find it innately rewarding just<br />to observe that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.119" end="00:34:38.850" style="s2">It&#39;s even in strange situations, like people<br />will go to horror movies.</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.850" end="00:34:39.850" style="s2">What&#39;s wrong with them?</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.850" end="00:34:42.310" style="s2">Why do you want to go and get scared?</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.310" end="00:34:43.310" style="s2">Or disgusted?</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.310" end="00:34:46.929" style="s2">Because that&#39;s horror, right--fear and disgust.</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.929" end="00:34:50.540" style="s2">Plain uncertainty horror movies like The Blair<br />Witch Project, that&#39;s pretty much all fear.</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.540" end="00:34:55.080" style="s2">And then the slasher movies and that sort<br />of thing, that&#39;s pretty much all disgust.</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.080" end="00:34:58.410" style="s2">And you might say, well why bother exposing<br />yourself to that.</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.410" end="00:35:02.460" style="s2">And part of it is: to get over it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.460" end="00:35:03.800" style="s2">You know, it&#39;s exposure.</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.800" end="00:35:08.740" style="s2">Because life has terrifying elements and it<br />has disgusting elements, and you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.740" end="00:35:14.830" style="s2">to have to learn to maintain yourself in the<br />face of that.</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.830" end="00:35:20.849" style="s2">Certainly illness is going to challenge your<br />capacity to deal with disgust.</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.849" end="00:35:27.660" style="s2">There&#39;s any number of reasons to be terrified<br />so, you go to movies and you practice facing</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.660" end="00:35:28.660" style="s2">it.</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.660" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">And you observe that you can.</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:35.030" style="s2">I mean there&#39;s other motivations too, but<br />those are sort of the healthy ones that go</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.030" end="00:35:39.480" style="s2">along with people wanting to expose themselves<br />to dangerous situations.</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.480" end="00:35:44.330" style="s2">So even in that you see exploration and preparation<br />for what&#39;s going to happen next.</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.330" end="00:35:47.470" style="s2">And the exploratory circuit is a very very<br />fundamental circuit.</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.470" end="00:35:49.180" style="s2">It&#39;s also hypothalamically mediated.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.180" end="00:35:55.670" style="s2">So, the way the hypothalamus works--it&#39;s quite<br />cool--is that, on one hand it pops up all</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.670" end="00:36:00.680" style="s2">these little maps that you can occupy that<br />have their core in, we&#39;ll say, biological</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.680" end="00:36:06.040" style="s2">necessity--so roughly Freud&#39;s id--but when<br />those things all shut down because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.040" end="00:36:12.770" style="s2">satiated, that&#39;s a technical term by the way--satiated,<br />it means satisfied--it&#39;s a form of reward.</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.770" end="00:36:19.680" style="s2">So it&#39;s sort of how you feel after you&#39;ve<br />eaten a good meal and you&#39;re in a warm room</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.680" end="00:36:25.040" style="s2">and your friends are around you and maybe<br />you go to sleep if it&#39;s your family.</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.040" end="00:36:31.339" style="s2">Because--I&#39;m thinking of thanksgiving or something<br />like that--everything is just taken care of</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.339" end="00:36:33.130" style="s2">and so you fall asleep.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.130" end="00:36:34.870" style="s2">That&#39;s satiation.</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.870" end="00:36:38.490" style="s2">You can see that in animals all the time because<br />they spend a lot of time satiated.</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.490" end="00:36:39.500" style="s2">Dogs: they sleep a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.500" end="00:36:41.000" style="s2">Cats: they sleep a lot.</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.000" end="00:36:46.180" style="s2">Because they&#39;ve already attacked their cat<br />food and so that&#39;s pretty much it for the</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.180" end="00:36:47.230" style="s2">day.</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.230" end="00:36:52.630" style="s2">Human beings, we tend not so much to enter<br />into states of satiation.</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.630" end="00:37:01.020" style="s2">Now what happens when you&#39;re in one of those<br />little units--one of those little motivated</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.020" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">things--there&#39;s a couple of things that can<br />happen.</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:07.330" style="s2">[Muttering].</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.330" end="00:37:42.000" style="s2">Okay so we talked about motivations as sort<br />of setting up this little frame.</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:44.660" style="s2">And then we can talk about emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.660" end="00:37:50.710" style="s2">So, there you are going somewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.710" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">And there&#39;s this little straight line that&#39;ll<br />take you there, this nice efficient way to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:56.210" style="s2">get there.</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.210" end="00:37:58.080" style="s2">Now why do you want to do it efficiently?</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.080" end="00:38:03.090" style="s2">Well, because you use up the least amount<br />of resources like that so you can maintain</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.090" end="00:38:06.480" style="s2">some resources for doing the next thing you<br />need to do.</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.480" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">So you care about efficiency and simplicity.</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:11.990" style="s2">So you want to go like the crow flies to the<br />destination.</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.990" end="00:38:15.070" style="s2">So then, what happens along the way?</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.070" end="00:38:19.260" style="s2">Well, let&#39;s say you just get to go straight.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.260" end="00:38:23.780" style="s2">Well basically what happens is that you&#39;re<br />motivated by your perception of the goal or</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.780" end="00:38:28.990" style="s2">intermediary goals because the goal can be<br />linked together, and then as long as things</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.990" end="00:38:34.940" style="s2">are going according to plan, as you move towards<br />the goal in an untrammelled way you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.940" end="00:38:36.660" style="s2">to feel mild positive emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.660" end="00:38:42.420" style="s2">And the reason for that is that you&#39;re turning<br />the environment--the environment almost never</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.420" end="00:38:43.940" style="s2">has...</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.940" end="00:38:45.530" style="s2">most of it (the environment) is irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.530" end="00:38:48.200" style="s2">The rest of it has a positive or negative<br />valence.</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.200" end="00:38:53.230" style="s2">And if things are going according to plan<br />it has a mild positive valence, right.</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.230" end="00:38:57.390" style="s2">You think things are okay, and really what<br />you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re observing two things.</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.390" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">You&#39;re observing that the things that should<br />be happening, if you know what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">while you&#39;re acting, are happening.</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:12.359" style="s2">And so each step forward is an indication<br />that you&#39;re getting closer to your goal.</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.359" end="00:39:16.180" style="s2">That&#39;s incentive reward.</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.180" end="00:39:19.540" style="s2">And that&#39;s the sort of reward that you actually<br />think of as fun.</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.540" end="00:39:25.070" style="s2">An incentive reward is produced by activation<br />of the exploratory system that&#39;s in the hypothalamus--it</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.070" end="00:39:29.260" style="s2">has its roots in the hypothalamus--and that&#39;s<br />the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.260" end="00:39:32.880" style="s2">And that&#39;s the system that cocaine and amphetamines<br />and all those drugs that people really like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.880" end="00:39:37.800" style="s2">to take hyperactivates, making them feel like<br />they&#39;re doing something important and useful.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.800" end="00:39:40.570" style="s2">Even though, in all likelihood, they&#39;re not.</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.570" end="00:39:44.630" style="s2">So the dopaminergic drugs in some sense hijack<br />your incentive reward systems.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.630" end="00:39:49.460" style="s2">And it&#39;s incentive reward because you&#39;re incentivized<br />to continue moving forward.</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.460" end="00:39:55.640" style="s2">Anything that you look at that makes you want<br />to touch it or move forward to it basically</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.640" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">activates the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:05.690" style="s2">Now, so you say, well what happens when you&#39;re<br />on your way to somewhere.</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.690" end="00:40:10.539" style="s2">Well, roughly what happens is neutral things,<br />which is okay.</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.539" end="00:40:11.740" style="s2">You can ignore them.</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.740" end="00:40:13.530" style="s2">Positive things or negative things.</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.530" end="00:40:17.500" style="s2">Positive things happen when things are going<br />according to plan or even better than according</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.500" end="00:40:18.500" style="s2">to plan.</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.500" end="00:40:22.070" style="s2">You&#39;re walking to school, it&#39;s raining, somebody<br />you know stops and offers you a life.</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.070" end="00:40:25.770" style="s2">It&#39;s like, well you&#39;re doing okay getting<br />to school and that was fine, but all of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.770" end="00:40:28.450" style="s2">sudden you&#39;re getting there a little faster<br />and you&#39;re not getting wet.</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.450" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">So that cheers you up.</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:35.240" style="s2">It&#39;s an indication that you&#39;re able to save<br />resources while you&#39;re moving towards a goal--dopaminergically</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.240" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">mediated.</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:40.721" style="s2">You know, and then we can imagine a different<br />scenario where you&#39;re walking to school in</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.721" end="00:40:45.099" style="s2">the rain and someone drives by you, maybe<br />it&#39;s even the same friend, and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.099" end="00:40:48.690" style="s2">see you and there&#39;s a puddle right beside<br />you and not only do they not stop but they</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.690" end="00:40:54.220" style="s2">completely cover you with oily and frigid<br />water, and so that&#39;s not so good.</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.220" end="00:40:58.190" style="s2">You&#39;re angry about that and upset.</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.190" end="00:40:59.630" style="s2">Why?</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.630" end="00:41:02.490" style="s2">Well, you might say, &quot;my day is ruined.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.490" end="00:41:04.350" style="s2">What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.350" end="00:41:09.410" style="s2">Well it means that you had a little map on<br />top of your day and you were hoping that the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.410" end="00:41:13.070" style="s2">day and the map would correspond, and then<br />all of a sudden the map burned up and god</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.070" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">only knows what&#39;s going to happen to the day.</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:18.980" style="s2">And so it&#39;s like the bottom has dropped out<br />of your map.</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.980" end="00:41:22.430" style="s2">And so then you have to worry about your clothes<br />and catching cold and all those things.</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.430" end="00:41:26.270" style="s2">And turning around and going home and what<br />it&#39;ll mean if you miss class and so on and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.270" end="00:41:27.270" style="s2">so forth.</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.270" end="00:41:30.550" style="s2">So basically that&#39;s the domain of chaos that<br />we talked about.</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.550" end="00:41:35.070" style="s2">So that&#39;s a negative thing, but it&#39;s also--the<br />thing about negative things is they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.070" end="00:41:38.740" style="s2">of hard to disentangle from unexpected things.</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.740" end="00:41:42.300" style="s2">You know, because most of the things that<br />happen to you that are negative are also unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.300" end="00:41:46.849" style="s2">because you don&#39;t go around trying to make<br />negative things happen.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.849" end="00:41:52.080" style="s2">So well, what happens when something negative<br />happens?</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.080" end="00:41:54.430" style="s2">Well, you get a negative emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.430" end="00:41:58.260" style="s2">Pain, anxiety, disgust.</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.260" end="00:42:01.710" style="s2">Those seem to be the big three.</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.710" end="00:42:03.880" style="s2">And they&#39;re mediated by different systems.</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.880" end="00:42:06.579" style="s2">We don&#39;t understand the disgust system very<br />well.</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.579" end="00:42:12.920" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t load with neuroticism because all<br />the other negative emotions load with trait</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.920" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">neuroticism.</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:19.040" style="s2">Pain--pain seems to be what you experience<br />if your receptive surfaces are--you know if</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.040" end="00:42:26.589" style="s2">your physiological self is subject to stimulation<br />of an intensity that&#39;s sufficient either to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.589" end="00:42:30.339" style="s2">damage it or to damage the receptors.</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.339" end="00:42:32.290" style="s2">You know, but pain is complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.290" end="00:42:35.420" style="s2">It&#39;s not just physical pain from physical<br />damage.</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.420" end="00:42:38.930" style="s2">It depends on how you define physical damage.</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.930" end="00:42:43.710" style="s2">If someone dies, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.710" end="00:42:46.220" style="s2">If you&#39;re alone and isolated, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.220" end="00:42:49.000" style="s2">If you&#39;re depressed, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.000" end="00:42:53.210" style="s2">If you&#39;re frustrated or disappointed, that&#39;s<br />pain.</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.210" end="00:42:57.270" style="s2">Frustrated might mean something gets in the<br />way of you moving towards a goal, and disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.270" end="00:43:00.770" style="s2">might mean the whole damn structure just collapsed<br />on you.</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.770" end="00:43:03.560" style="s2">Either way, that&#39;s pain.</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.560" end="00:43:09.079" style="s2">Now the behaviourists would have called that<br />an unconditioned--like a painful stimulus--they</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.079" end="00:43:11.130" style="s2">would&#39;ve called that an unconditioned stimulus.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.130" end="00:43:14.750" style="s2">You don&#39;t have to learn for it to be bad.</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.750" end="00:43:16.930" style="s2">It&#39;s sort of built in bad.</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.930" end="00:43:22.290" style="s2">And they would think about anxiety in response<br />to the unexpected as learned.</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.290" end="00:43:30.170" style="s2">The behaviourists would think that you need<br />to learn what predicts something painful.</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.170" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">And if you learn that something predicts something<br />painful then you get anxious to it or afraid</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:37.550" style="s2">of it.</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.550" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">But it turns out that it&#39;s more complicated<br />than that.</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.640" style="s2">So what the behaviourists would think is that<br />pain in some sense is the fundamental negative</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.640" end="00:43:46.410" style="s2">emotion.</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.410" end="00:43:52.940" style="s2">And then maybe you&#39;re a kid and you stand<br />up underneath a table and you whack your head</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.940" end="00:43:54.240" style="s2">on it when you&#39;re learning to walk.</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.240" end="00:43:58.570" style="s2">And then when you go under the table now you<br />get anxious because you&#39;ve learned that if</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.570" end="00:44:01.930" style="s2">you stand up under the table, you bang your<br />head and that hurts.</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.930" end="00:44:04.530" style="s2">So anxiety under those circumstances is a<br />learned behaviour.</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.530" end="00:44:06.480" style="s2">It&#39;s a conditioned response.</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.480" end="00:44:07.480" style="s2">Got it?</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.480" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">Okay, but it&#39;s more complicated than that<br />because anxiety can also be an unlearned response.</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">So if you just encounter something you&#39;ve<br />never seen before, it&#39;s going to make you</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:19.880" style="s2">anxious.</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.880" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">There&#39;s actually a circuit that mediates anxiety.</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.230" style="s2">It&#39;s not just a secondary derivation of the<br />pain circuitry.</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.230" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">It&#39;s its own little unit.</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:34.420" style="s2">And it&#39;s sort of like you&#39;ve figured out over<br />time--evolutionary time--not to get hurt because</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.420" end="00:44:35.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be damaged.</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.760" end="00:44:41.490" style="s2">But then, you&#39;ve learned how to detect the<br />probability that you will get hurt for so</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.490" end="00:44:46.250" style="s2">long that you&#39;ve also evolved a system just<br />to respond to that.</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.250" end="00:44:50.770" style="s2">And so some of that responds to things that<br />you have learned are dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.770" end="00:44:54.900" style="s2">Some of it responds to things that are generally<br />just dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.900" end="00:45:04.099" style="s2">Blood, spiders, insects of various sorts,<br />facial expressions that indicate fear or disgust</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.099" end="00:45:12.210" style="s2">or anger, broken limbs, bodies--especially<br />mutilated ones.</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.210" end="00:45:16.790" style="s2">You know what&#39;s in horror movies, that&#39;s all<br />sort of primary fear stimuli, right.</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.790" end="00:45:17.849" style="s2">And it&#39;s built right into you.</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.849" end="00:45:22.859" style="s2">Now psychologists debate about whether it&#39;s<br />built in or whether you can just learn it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.859" end="00:45:24.079" style="s2">really easily.</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.079" end="00:45:25.829" style="s2">But I would say that there&#39;s sort of a continuum.</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.829" end="00:45:27.369" style="s2">Some of it seems pretty damn built-in.</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.369" end="00:45:30.530" style="s2">Snake-fear, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.530" end="00:45:33.540" style="s2">Chimps who&#39;ve never seen snakes, you bring<br />one into their cage--if it&#39;s a rubber snake--poof,</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.540" end="00:45:35.329" style="s2">they hit the roof.</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.329" end="00:45:36.570" style="s2">And then they look at it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.570" end="00:45:41.060" style="s2">And snakes in the wild, a chimp will go up<br />to a big snake in the wild and hoot at it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.060" end="00:45:44.180" style="s2">They have a special snake--they call it a<br />snake [rah?]--and they&#39;ll look at the thing,</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.180" end="00:45:48.200" style="s2">and some of them will just look at the snake<br />for like 24 hours.</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.200" end="00:45:51.720" style="s2">So, partly they&#39;re afraid of it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.720" end="00:45:52.760" style="s2">Partly they want to explore it.</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.760" end="00:45:57.670" style="s2">So what they do, they get close to it and<br />the fear increases, and then they back up</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.670" end="00:45:59.650" style="s2">and the fear decreases and the curiosity increases.</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.650" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">And so what happens is that they move back<br />and forth until they&#39;re right on the line</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:05.980" style="s2">where they&#39;re afraid, but they&#39;re curious.</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.980" end="00:46:08.579" style="s2">So then they&#39;re stuck, and they&#39;re looking<br />at it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.579" end="00:46:13.500" style="s2">And you experience that all the time actually,<br />because when you are engaged in something</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.500" end="00:46:16.920" style="s2">that&#39;s meaningful, that&#39;s where you are.</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.920" end="00:46:19.470" style="s2">And that&#39;s like the line between order and<br />chaos.</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.470" end="00:46:21.660" style="s2">You know, because you want to solve it--it&#39;s<br />important.</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.660" end="00:46:26.680" style="s2">Maybe you&#39;re reading papers about some illness<br />that you hope to work on or study.</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.680" end="00:46:29.540" style="s2">It&#39;s like, well you&#39;re worried about the damn<br />illness, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.540" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">All you&#39;re doing is confronting it through<br />the papers so, you know, you&#39;re fairly well</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:34.440" style="s2">sheltered from it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.440" end="00:46:38.609" style="s2">But you don&#39;t want it to exist and you&#39;d rather<br />it wasn&#39;t around, but you&#39;re curious so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.609" end="00:46:39.880" style="s2">going to get engrossed in it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.880" end="00:46:44.599" style="s2">And most of you, to the degree that you&#39;re<br />immersed in anything, are partly immersed</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.599" end="00:46:47.490" style="s2">because you perceive it as a problem.</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.490" end="00:46:51.099" style="s2">So that&#39;s like existential anxiety in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.099" end="00:46:53.380" style="s2">It&#39;s just part of being.</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.380" end="00:46:55.420" style="s2">There&#39;s problems that have to be solved.</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.420" end="00:46:58.450" style="s2">They produce anxiety, they&#39;re complicated.</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.450" end="00:47:02.750" style="s2">You find this--you find a way of approaching<br />them so that the anxiety doesn&#39;t overwhelm</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.750" end="00:47:07.260" style="s2">you and so the curiosity is optimized--that&#39;s<br />an incentive reward activation--and then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.260" end="00:47:08.260" style="s2">awake.</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.260" end="00:47:11.390" style="s2">Because the anxiety keeps you awake and so<br />does the curiosity.</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.390" end="00:47:13.390" style="s2">And you think, yeah, this is a good place<br />to be.</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.390" end="00:47:17.220" style="s2">And it is a good place to be because you&#39;re<br />optimally protected right there and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.220" end="00:47:18.579" style="s2">optimally learning.</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.579" end="00:47:21.540" style="s2">So yes, that&#39;s a good place to be.</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.540" end="00:47:28.119" style="s2">You can think about that as an answer to the<br />Nietzschean problem of how you create value.</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.119" end="00:47:31.530" style="s2">You don&#39;t exactly create it--you find it.</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.530" end="00:47:36.750" style="s2">There&#39;s problems that need to be solved, they<br />automatically engage your emotions--both positively</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.750" end="00:47:40.119" style="s2">and negatively--you&#39;ve got to find the right<br />balance.</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.119" end="00:47:42.460" style="s2">And it&#39;s something like contending, you know.</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.460" end="00:47:46.470" style="s2">It seems to me like humans beings have to<br />have something to contend with, or they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.470" end="00:47:47.780" style="s2">tolerate themselves.</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.780" end="00:47:52.490" style="s2">Because life seems like a stupid joke if you<br />don&#39;t have something worthwhile to do.</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.490" end="00:47:54.140" style="s2">But you can have something worthwhile to do.</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.140" end="00:47:58.490" style="s2">And so then maybe it&#39;s not so stupid and absurd<br />and tragic.</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.490" end="00:48:01.670" style="s2">And that&#39;s at least a good way to think about<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.670" end="00:48:05.420" style="s2">(00:48:00)<br />So you&#39;ve got satiation on the one hand, on</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.420" end="00:48:09.670" style="s2">the positive side, and the behaviourists would&#39;ve<br />considered that an unconditioned response</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.670" end="00:48:10.670" style="s2">too.</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.670" end="00:48:12.460" style="s2">They really thought about that as a reward<br />initially.</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.460" end="00:48:16.619" style="s2">You know, so you take a rat--he&#39;s hungry--and<br />you feed him something: reward.</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.619" end="00:48:24.329" style="s2">Now Skinner, he used to train rats, right,<br />and he was a very--what would you call it--very</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.329" end="00:48:27.110" style="s2">well renowned behavioural psychologists.</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.110" end="00:48:29.990" style="s2">And he could train rats to do damn near anything.</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.990" end="00:48:37.190" style="s2">And what he would do is starve them to three<br />quarters of their body weight--they were basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.190" end="00:48:38.190" style="s2">hungry rats.</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.190" end="00:48:43.150" style="s2">They were hungry lonesome rats because they<br />lived an isolated existence, which rats don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.150" end="00:48:48.090" style="s2">like, and then they were starved down to three<br />quarters of their body weight.</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.090" end="00:48:52.640" style="s2">When the behaviourists used rats as a model<br />for people, they actually used hungry lonesome</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.640" end="00:48:56.760" style="s2">rats as a model for rats as a model for people.</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.760" end="00:48:58.740" style="s2">And you might think, well what kind of model<br />is that?</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.740" end="00:49:02.690" style="s2">But it turns out it&#39;s a pretty good model,<br />because you&#39;re a lot more like a scared hungry</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.690" end="00:49:05.350" style="s2">rat than you&#39;d like to admit.</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.350" end="00:49:08.390" style="s2">Which is partly why you can empathize with<br />one, right.</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.390" end="00:49:11.400" style="s2">Everybody&#39;s sitting there thinking &quot;oh the<br />poor rats&quot;.</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.400" end="00:49:13.960" style="s2">By the way, the more you thought that, the<br />more agreeable you are.</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.960" end="00:49:17.120" style="s2">So how many people were feeling pretty sorry<br />for those rats?</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.120" end="00:49:18.120" style="s2">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.120" end="00:49:19.420" style="s2">How about men?</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.420" end="00:49:23.069" style="s2">How many men were feeling sorry for those<br />rats?</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.069" end="00:49:25.099" style="s2">Oh yeah, about three.</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.099" end="00:49:31.170" style="s2">There&#39;s a big gender difference in agreeableness<br />between men and women, by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.170" end="00:49:34.579" style="s2">Just so you know--we&#39;ll talk about that more.</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.579" end="00:49:39.741" style="s2">So now the behaviourists also thought that<br />you have this primary set of rewards, call</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.741" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">them unconditioned, and then you had to learn<br />that some things predicted them.</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:52.750" style="s2">Like, classically maybe, a rat would push<br />a lever and get a pellet.</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.750" end="00:49:54.230" style="s2">Soon he&#39;s pushing that lever like mad.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.230" end="00:49:56.440" style="s2">He&#39;s pretty happy about pushing that lever.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.440" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">And he learned the conditioned association<br />between lever pushing and getting a reward.</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:06.109" style="s2">But it turns out that because that&#39;s been<br />around for so long, you also have a system</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.109" end="00:50:07.109" style="s2">for it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.109" end="00:50:11.310" style="s2">So it&#39;s not just a learned association to<br />what satiates you--it&#39;s a whole system.</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.310" end="00:50:14.010" style="s2">And that&#39;s the dopaminergic system.</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.010" end="00:50:17.760" style="s2">The serotonin system seems to be the thing<br />that satiates.</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.760" end="00:50:22.260" style="s2">So you know, if you have a big turkey dinner,<br />up goes the serotonin levels--you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.260" end="00:50:23.260" style="s2">to do anything.</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.260" end="00:50:28.510" style="s2">And serotonin is a calming and regulating<br />neurochemical.</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.510" end="00:50:33.730" style="s2">Which is why antidepressants stop your neurons<br />from taking up serotonin before you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.730" end="00:50:38.579" style="s2">a real chance to use it to regulate your nervous<br />system.</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.579" end="00:50:42.670" style="s2">But dopamine tells you, hey, good things are<br />on their way.</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.670" end="00:50:44.820" style="s2">And that&#39;s pretty much what people run on.</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.820" end="00:50:46.890" style="s2">And you can think about that as hope.</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.890" end="00:50:49.900" style="s2">So incentive reward is sort of like hope,<br />or promise.</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.900" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">I think promise is a better term.</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:57.970" style="s2">So there&#39;s pain and satiation, and those are<br />really ancient systems.</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.970" end="00:51:05.650" style="s2">And then there are newer systems that are<br />anxiety and promise.</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.650" end="00:51:10.490" style="s2">And those are related to those more fundamental<br />negative and positive emotions.</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.490" end="00:51:13.580" style="s2">And those things regulate you while you&#39;re<br />on your path.</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.580" end="00:51:18.599" style="s2">Now, there&#39;s one more level of complication,<br />because you think, well what can happen on</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.599" end="00:51:20.020" style="s2">the way to your goal.</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.020" end="00:51:21.020" style="s2">Nothing?</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.020" end="00:51:22.020" style="s2">Irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.020" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">Okay, so that&#39;s the irrelevance that enables<br />you to not see the gorilla.</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:31.180" style="s2">And almost everything around you is irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.180" end="00:51:34.099" style="s2">And I think that&#39;s partly why I think people<br />don&#39;t like to have their little maps of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.099" end="00:51:36.060" style="s2">world destroyed.</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.060" end="00:51:41.150" style="s2">Because if your map of the world is thoroughly<br />demolished everything becomes relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.150" end="00:51:44.230" style="s2">And you do not want everything to become relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.230" end="00:51:46.290" style="s2">It&#39;s just too much for you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.290" end="00:51:50.540" style="s2">So you wake up and you&#39;re naked and it&#39;s dark<br />in the middle of a jungle.</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.540" end="00:51:51.980" style="s2">It&#39;s like, everything&#39;s relevant!</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.980" end="00:51:54.200" style="s2">You&#39;re not going to like that.</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.200" end="00:51:55.720" style="s2">It&#39;s going to burn you out quick.</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.720" end="00:52:01.290" style="s2">And so most of the time you have to be protected<br />so that almost everything&#39;s irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.290" end="00:52:06.980" style="s2">And then you can focus on the few things that<br />you&#39;re capable of handling, and you do that.</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.980" end="00:52:11.630" style="s2">So you&#39;re in your little map, and then as<br />you move towards it your emotions play.</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.630" end="00:52:15.300" style="s2">And the negative emotions appear when things<br />are not going well and the positive emotions</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.300" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">appear when things are going well.</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:20.099" style="s2">That&#39;s basically how your emotions work.</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.099" end="00:52:24.990" style="s2">Now, you&#39;ve got your satiation and your pain.</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.990" end="00:52:28.280" style="s2">Then you&#39;ve got your threat and your promise.</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.280" end="00:52:31.980" style="s2">Then on top of that you&#39;ve got a more complicated<br />thing which is novelty, because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.980" end="00:52:37.250" style="s2">other thing that can happen when you&#39;re on<br />the way from point A to point B. Something</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.250" end="00:52:42.190" style="s2">you didn&#39;t expect--and you don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.190" end="00:52:54.690" style="s2">So </p>
<p begin="00:52:54.690" end="00:53:02.040" style="s2">you&#39;re walking down the street and there&#39;s<br />someone laying there face-down on the sidewalk.</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.040" end="00:53:08.589" style="s2">And you know, they&#39;re dishevelled, and so<br />well, what&#39;s your emotional response?</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.589" end="00:53:13.380" style="s2">Well you didn&#39;t expect it, so you&#39;re going<br />to be taken aback a bit: that&#39;s anxiety.</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.380" end="00:53:17.609" style="s2">It&#39;s like, you&#39;re moving towards your goal<br />and anxiety stops you.</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.609" end="00:53:25.500" style="s2">Now you can think of the space-time area around<br />that person as unexplored territory.</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.500" end="00:53:28.910" style="s2">Now you don&#39;t want any unexplored territory<br />in your map because god only knows what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.910" end="00:53:30.990" style="s2">going to happen there.</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.990" end="00:53:33.190" style="s2">So what&#39;re you supposed to do?</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.190" end="00:53:36.370" style="s2">Well maybe you cross the street--you think<br />well that person&#39;s drunk or maybe you think,</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.370" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">well they&#39;re a homeless person.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:41.010" style="s2">Maybe they&#39;re lying on a sleeping back--you<br />think they&#39;re just asleep.</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.010" end="00:53:46.060" style="s2">You&#39;re going to stop and then you&#39;re going<br />to observe, and then you&#39;re going to use little</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.060" end="00:53:47.970" style="s2">cues to try to put your map back together.</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.970" end="00:53:51.420" style="s2">And your map is, what’s going on here and<br />what should I do about it?</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.420" end="00:53:54.930" style="s2">And so, it&#39;s partly this interplay between<br />anxiety and curiosity.</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.930" end="00:53:59.540" style="s2">Now you can just step around it and continue,<br />but maybe that&#39;ll upset your moral map--what</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.540" end="00:54:00.800" style="s2">kind of person am I?</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.800" end="00:54:02.721" style="s2">Maybe I should have done something about it.</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.721" end="00:54:07.560" style="s2">Or maybe you think, there&#39;s no damn way I&#39;m<br />going to get involved in this because, who</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.560" end="00:54:09.700" style="s2">knows what&#39;ll happen if I step in there.</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.700" end="00:54:14.720" style="s2">And you know, fair enough, because, who knows<br />what&#39;ll happen if you step in there.</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.720" end="00:54:21.079" style="s2">The point is that, it&#39;s like your map which<br />has made everything irrelevant has got a hole</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.079" end="00:54:25.140" style="s2">in it and now some of what&#39;s complicated is<br />shining through.</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.140" end="00:54:28.880" style="s2">And that thing that&#39;s shining through--so<br />that&#39;s like what the phenomenologists talked</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.880" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">about as shining forth--that thing that&#39;s<br />shining through, it&#39;s like you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:34.750" style="s2">what to do about it.</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.750" end="00:54:36.119" style="s2">What should you do?</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.119" end="00:54:42.470" style="s2">Well, you should do what you do do, and what<br />you do is, you prepare to do everything.</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.470" end="00:54:45.140" style="s2">And that&#39;s an emotional response to novelty.</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.140" end="00:54:50.109" style="s2">Well, if you don&#39;t know what to do you should<br />prepare yourself for anything.</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.109" end="00:54:52.829" style="s2">And that&#39;s stress.</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.829" end="00:54:55.230" style="s2">You could prepare that something good will<br />happen.</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.230" end="00:54:57.880" style="s2">Let’s say you&#39;re in an ambivalent.</p>
