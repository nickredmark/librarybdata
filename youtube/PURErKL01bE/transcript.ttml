<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">awesome all right i mean i think so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">could also call it which but</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:50.320" style="s2">i think pariah is better which which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:52.960" style="s2">in w-i-t-c-h</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.320" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">yes which right and the thing yeah it it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.960" end="00:01:56.159" style="s2">harkens back to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">the uh model of witch hunts that i had</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.159" end="00:02:01.680" style="s2">on the board a mere day or two prior to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">uh my being challenged by all of those</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.680" end="00:02:05.520" style="s2">people that i&#39;d never met</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:06.560" style="s2">over the racism that i didn&#39;t have in</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">may of 2017</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.560" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">may of 2017 may 23rd i believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">just before 10 in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">could you reconstruct the model of witch</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:15.440" style="s2">hunts that you had drawn on the board</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">for your students</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.440" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">i think so presciently i believe so i</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">believe it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">um a very small number of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">will initiate a witch hunt a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">number of people</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">will attend a witch hunt a</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:34.480" style="s2">large number of people will stand</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">silently by</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">as the witch hunt progresses and a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">number of people will</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">oppose okay um</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">that actually sounds very much to me</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">like a question that we weren&#39;t it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:52.400" style="s2">it was number 10 here but let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:54.319" style="s2">jump right to before going back to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.400" end="00:02:56.640" style="s2">questions from last episode someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.319" end="00:02:58.159" style="s2">in the last hour said with evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.640" end="00:02:59.360" style="s2">with the woke with any of these things</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.159" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">what percent are consciously</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.360" end="00:03:02.640" style="s2">manipulating the movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">can it be zero percent or is the entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.640" end="00:03:06.000" style="s2">movement like the fortune teller who</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">believes in his own abilities</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.000" end="00:03:09.120" style="s2">so this strikes me as very very much in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:12.000" style="s2">line with</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.120" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">this model of which which huntery yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.000" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">that you just described</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">i would say witch hunt does not involve</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">anybody necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">behaving manipulatively i mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean that in general</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.560" end="00:03:25.519" style="s2">there&#39;s not a certain percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">manipulators but i don&#39;t think any</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.519" end="00:03:31.760" style="s2">percentage has to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:32.879" style="s2">for one thing you could get uh organic</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.879" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">delusion right right the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.360" style="s2">like exactly like with airgut may well</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.360" end="00:03:43.280" style="s2">organic delusion yeah a mixture of rumor</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.319" style="s2">and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.280" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">uh well no actually sorry i the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.319" end="00:03:51.519" style="s2">the proposed witches uh are</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:54.560" style="s2">were imagined to have been suffering</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:57.760" style="s2">from having inhaled air gut which is uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.560" end="00:04:00.799" style="s2">related to modern synthetic lsd but</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.760" end="00:04:01.360" style="s2">is it also true that uh the townspeople</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.799" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:05.280" style="s2">on the witch hunt were imagined oh i</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:07.040" style="s2">think so yeah yes it was it was it was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.280" end="00:04:08.959" style="s2">community-wide</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.040" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">problem i&#39;m not saying you have ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.959" end="00:04:13.519" style="s2">done hallucinogens but anybody who has</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">done hallucinogens can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.519" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">that you would be susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">imagining that others were engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">magical sorcery based on the distortions</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.199" style="s2">that one gets in their perception</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:26.800" style="s2">absolutely that that could look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.199" end="00:04:28.160" style="s2">magic and why aren&#39;t you saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.800" end="00:04:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;ve never done hallucinogens you would</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.160" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">want to cast aspersions</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.520" end="00:04:33.440" style="s2">no i just uh i don&#39;t want you to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">arrested</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.440" end="00:04:37.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t think having done them is itself</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:39.440" style="s2">a crime is it um</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.360" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">well that would depend whether you did</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.440" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">them knowingly and i am not saying that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:43.840" style="s2">you did</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.400" end="00:04:48.240" style="s2">an answer for a different question</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.759" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">perhaps okay</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.240" end="00:04:50.639" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.720" end="00:04:56.080" style="s2">no fan of trump but credit where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:57.600" style="s2">due his stance against</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.080" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">critical race theory is emboldening you</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.600" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">admit he&#39;s not a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">could he be a temporary solution so this</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">is you know this was written</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:08.840" style="s2">last episode not this in light of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">conversation here</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.840" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">um i honestly don&#39;t know which of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">candidates is worse</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s hard to know but i will say</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:17.840" style="s2">from the point of view of this narrow</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.960" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">issue</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.840" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">he&#39;s shoring up the federal government</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">and that which is connected to it so</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.560" end="00:05:25.039" style="s2">that critical race theory cannot render</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:28.639" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.039" end="00:05:32.000" style="s2">insane is necessary</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.639" end="00:05:34.000" style="s2">um trump is doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.000" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine that biden would it</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.000" end="00:05:37.360" style="s2">would be putting the finger</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.280" style="s2">a finger in the eye of a constituency</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.360" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">that i think he&#39;s counting on</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">yeah and that his choice of running mate</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">is explicitly</p>

<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:55.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that harris is herself um</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.400" end="00:05:58.000" style="s2">buying in to the the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.600" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">the woke ideology but she is perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.000" end="00:06:01.520" style="s2">willing</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">to throw the rest of us to the wolves if</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.520" end="00:06:03.919" style="s2">it helps get her votes and advance her</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:05.840" style="s2">career</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.919" end="00:06:08.639" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a uh i think you have</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.840" end="00:06:10.160" style="s2">not yet seen the movie vice</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.639" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">i think i have not yet seen the movie</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.160" end="00:06:13.199" style="s2">vice back when you and i were which is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:16.639" style="s2">about cheney</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.199" end="00:06:17.440" style="s2">flying places yeah um i saw it on a</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.639" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">plane</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.440" end="00:06:20.880" style="s2">quite liked it and you know it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:21.440" style="s2">upfront about its political bias so</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.880" end="00:06:23.759" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.440" end="00:06:24.960" style="s2">it&#39;s approaching no it&#39;s anti-changing</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.759" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">but i actually found it quite</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.960" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">sympathetic in its own way okay but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">it came from the left and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">acknowledges that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">but in any case there&#39;s a scene in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.720" style="s2">a young cheney who has effectively</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:38.240" style="s2">signed up with the republicans because</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.720" end="00:06:42.800" style="s2">it seemed like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.240" end="00:06:46.240" style="s2">um the better vessel rather than out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.800" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">belief is talking to donald rumsfeld his</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.240" end="00:06:50.639" style="s2">mentor</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:52.479" style="s2">about um i forgotten what the issue was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.639" end="00:06:55.599" style="s2">but somehow rumsfeld</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.479" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">gives him a confusing answer as to</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:00.160" style="s2">what they are to do and the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:03.199" style="s2">cheney character says to him</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.160" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">but donald what do we believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.199" end="00:07:08.319" style="s2">and rumsfeld laughs in his face</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">what do we believe and this is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.319" end="00:07:12.160" style="s2">what i think of kamala harris is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:13.520" style="s2">the idea that she believes anything at</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.160" end="00:07:16.160" style="s2">all is pretty far-fetched</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.520" end="00:07:17.360" style="s2">now she&#39;s the most um i don&#39;t i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.160" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">know what to think about pence but if we</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.360" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">if we think about trump biden and harris</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:23.520" style="s2">she&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:24.319" style="s2">explicitly political animal um and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.520" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">know maybe that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.319" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">because she&#39;s sort of the most coherent</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">like you can see because she&#39;s young</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:31.840" style="s2">enough to be totally</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">uh she has all of her faculties and</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.840" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">um they just they don&#39;t look honorable</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.240" style="s2">looks uh ambitious to the exclusion of</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">everything else yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.240" end="00:07:44.319" style="s2">like belief yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">okay uh oh another question from last</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.319" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:48.800" style="s2">do you have thoughts on prop 16 in</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">california</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.800" end="00:07:51.440" style="s2">right so we didn&#39;t answer this because</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:52.639" style="s2">we thought we remember what it was and</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.440" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">we weren&#39;t sure</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.639" end="00:07:59.599" style="s2">uh it prop 16 would reverse</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">prop 200 something something 70 i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.599" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">would reverse a long-standing uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">proposition in california that forbids</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">affirmative action effectively</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">so prop 16 if it passes would allow</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">for hiring decisions and other kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:18.800" style="s2">decisions on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">sex race greed whatever greed is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.800" end="00:08:23.759" style="s2">disability etc</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:24.879" style="s2">so i am going to carefully and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.759" end="00:08:27.680" style="s2">without anyone</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.879" end="00:08:30.000" style="s2">noticing sidestep the issue of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.680" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">particular ballot proposal i should say</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">you and i both grew up in california and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:35.440" style="s2">i regard california&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">initiative model extremely frightening</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">right the way california does ballot</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.880" style="s2">initiatives</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">is prone to all kinds of manipulation i</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.880" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">remember battles between</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.640" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">industry-written bills and uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">actually corrective bills that were</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">designed to confuse you</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">so anyway well we i mean we won&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">but we could spend a long time talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">about you know we lived through</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">uh prop 13 right so prop 13</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">directly changed property tax law and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">the cost when it passed was to</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.000" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">defund public education such that</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">california went from having some of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">best public schools in the country to</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">having some of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">practically overnight so i will just sum</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">up that phase as</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:28.080" style="s2">we lived through proposition 13 barely</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">um all right that&#39;s not exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.080" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">happened but that would be an</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">interesting conversation to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:35.760" style="s2">um but but not for right now just the</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">point being neither you nor i have read</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.760" end="00:09:40.320" style="s2">proposition 16</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">um so you you want a sidestep hi friend</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.320" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">uh you want a sidestep speaking directly</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">to that but but</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">talk about the issue speak about</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:47.519" style="s2">affirmative action i would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:51.279" style="s2">affirmative action</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.519" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">i believe is warranted but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.279" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">it has been a problematic policy in</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">other words it doesn&#39;t do what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">intended to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">and maybe most importantly it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:03.839" style="s2">be temporary</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:05.040" style="s2">right it needs to be targeted at solving</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.839" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">a problem and at the point that it</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.040" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">solves the problem it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:09.040" style="s2">eliminated or at the point that it fails</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:11.360" style="s2">to solve the problem it needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.040" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">eliminated in favor of something else</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.360" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">so what i would say is i am now</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">in light of the modern sensibilities</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:19.760" style="s2">surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.279" style="s2">race and achievement and all very</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.760" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">concerned</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.279" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">that the sensibility is oh</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">this is a problem it will always be a</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">problem therefore we will need this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:33.040" style="s2">remedy permanently and anytime you set</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">affirmative action in motion with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.040" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">idea that it is the new order forever</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:40.079" style="s2">um you&#39;ve done something wrong so uh i</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">would i would like to have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.079" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">clear-headed conversation about the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s a difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:47.519" style="s2">justification of a remedy the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">effectiveness of that remedy</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.519" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">and the durability of that remedy and</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">even those of us who are fiercely</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.040" style="s2">committed to the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.800" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">of a fair society and recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.040" end="00:11:01.440" style="s2">society is</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">biased in ways that demand a remedy may</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.440" end="00:11:04.880" style="s2">not be in favor of these remedies that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:07.200" style="s2">have been deployed</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.880" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">because they haven&#39;t done what they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.200" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">and what they have done is created a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:13.839" style="s2">whole kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:14.959" style="s2">a whole set of unintended consequences</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.839" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">that are very negative for the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.959" end="00:11:19.200" style="s2">populations in question</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:22.560" style="s2">yeah and i i should have looked up when</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.200" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">the proposition that 16 would um would</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.560" end="00:11:28.640" style="s2">obliterate past but my my suspicion is</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">that somewhere 20 25 years ago or so</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.640" end="00:11:35.680" style="s2">and the modern sensibility as you put it</p>

<p begin="00:11:35.680" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.399" end="00:11:41.680" style="s2">and it is unsolvable this is obviously</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:43.920" style="s2">an attempt to solve it which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.680" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">inconsistent itself with the ideology of</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">has revealed a greater chasm</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">than what what was occurring before that</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">proposition 200 something was passed</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:08.639" style="s2">right like</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.160" style="s2">you need to actually compare and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.639" end="00:12:11.920" style="s2">know it&#39;s impossible to do it perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.160" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">because you can&#39;t control for time</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.920" end="00:12:15.360" style="s2">but what was you know what did the</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.160" style="s2">disparities</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.360" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">um look like before proposition 200</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.160" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">whatever it was was passed</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">what does it look like uh two years ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">say before the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">before this has gotten completely to</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">fever pitch as right now</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:30.959" style="s2">uh and if it hasn&#39;t gotten worse</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:32.480" style="s2">and my guess is it&#39;s actually gotten</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.959" end="00:12:36.000" style="s2">quite a bit better</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.480" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">then on what basis would you possibly um</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.000" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">seek out a solution under which</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:42.639" style="s2">conditions were worse than they are now</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:44.079" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make any sense uh and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.639" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t exactly affirmative</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.079" end="00:12:46.399" style="s2">action but</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:55.360" style="s2">itself and this isn&#39;t like i say exactly</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:57.839" style="s2">affirmative action but didn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:13:17.000" end="00:13:22.000" style="s2">unbelievable it&#39;s one unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">thing in a long list of unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.000" end="00:13:26.240" style="s2">things which tells us something about</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">where we&#39;ve ended up and how far we have</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.240" end="00:13:31.760" style="s2">fallen from the most basic principles</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:34.959" style="s2">that the republic is is founded on</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.760" end="00:13:37.839" style="s2">yeah um all right so okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.959" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">penultimate question from episode 47</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.839" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">what are the differences between the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.399" style="s2">sperm that gets to fertilize the eggs</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.639" end="00:13:44.160" style="s2">from those that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.399" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">how does this affect humans born from in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.160" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">vitro fertilization</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">totally the sperm that fertilize the egg</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:52.959" style="s2">those are</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">winners yeah i mean just almost by</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:56.320" style="s2">definition yeah we&#39;re all from winners</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">yeah well here&#39;s what you want to know</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.320" end="00:14:00.560" style="s2">and this is why you took the time to</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">write that question to a pair</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.560" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">of biologists</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.720" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">at large the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:14.399" style="s2">phenotype of the sperm that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:17.839" style="s2">its physical nature in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.399" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">is the result of the genotype of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.839" end="00:14:23.199" style="s2">the individual that produced it not the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">particular subset of genes that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.199" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">carries i believe that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.399" style="s2">remains the conclusion of the study that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:30.639" style="s2">has been done on this</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.399" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">really so so to put that into slightly</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.639" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">less uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">biologically dense language what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">just said and i did not know this to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">true what you are claiming is true</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">is that uh all of the sperm</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:44.720" style="s2">from a single individual will have the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">same phenotype</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.720" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">uh obviously there will be</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">noise because there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">differences in the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">environment for each sperm</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">but it will not be heritable from</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">the genes carried within that sperm</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:02.959" style="s2">but there will be sort of cellular</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:03.839" style="s2">developmental differences</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.959" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t know that they would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.839" end="00:15:06.959" style="s2">measurable i just it would be impossible</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">for them to be zero</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.959" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">so and and yet some sperm seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">faster than others</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">right so you think that&#39;s just about</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">like initial conditions getting stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">an eddy or something</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:19.440" style="s2">something like that yeah um so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.959" style="s2">you can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.440" end="00:15:23.839" style="s2">for one thing uh path path literal path</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.959" end="00:15:25.920" style="s2">dependence</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.839" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">and the exhaustion of some sperm based</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.920" end="00:15:28.959" style="s2">on whatever energy reserves they had</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">would leave them swimming slower at the</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.959" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">point you chose to measure them</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">um you got me envisioning salmon</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:38.160" style="s2">right which are bigger a bit yes um</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.639" style="s2">multicellular too</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.160" end="00:15:41.519" style="s2">yeah i mean this is just among other</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.639" end="00:15:45.440" style="s2">differences among</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.519" end="00:15:47.120" style="s2">other differences yes um</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.440" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">jokes suggest themselves but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.120" end="00:15:51.519" style="s2">going to make any of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">not here not here not ever really</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.519" end="00:15:54.880" style="s2">well i think you will we will find out</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.880" end="00:15:58.480" style="s2">they might not though no they they will</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:16:01.040" style="s2">not um but yes so</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.480" end="00:16:02.079" style="s2">my understanding and this is you know i</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.079" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">i i know it from a study with bob</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.399" style="s2">trivers</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">back in college so it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.399" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">something has upended this result or</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.480" style="s2">that there&#39;s more nuance to it</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">but yes the the differences in the sperm</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.480" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">are not the result of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:22.000" style="s2">differences of the subset of genes so</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:24.959" style="s2">to take to take the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.000" end="00:16:25.680" style="s2">um caricature version to establish this</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.959" end="00:16:28.959" style="s2">if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.680" end="00:16:31.920" style="s2">loser parent and a winner parent and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.959" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">shuffling of jeans resulted in one sperm</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.920" end="00:16:34.800" style="s2">so you&#39;re a dude who&#39;s got a loser</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">parent and a winter parent</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.800" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">and you are creating sperm each of which</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:41.360" style="s2">have half of your genome and some of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:42.800" style="s2">those spur will actually be entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.360" end="00:16:44.320" style="s2">from your loser parent and some of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.800" end="00:16:45.519" style="s2">will be entirely from your winter parent</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.320" end="00:16:46.560" style="s2">although that&#39;s really really rare</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.519" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">because most of them will be mixed</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.560" end="00:16:49.519" style="s2">will pretty much never happen very</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:50.160" style="s2">occasionally some of your sperm will be</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.519" end="00:16:51.839" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.160" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">related to your mother and not at all</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.839" end="00:16:54.000" style="s2">related to your father no actually it</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.000" end="00:16:57.279" style="s2">can&#39;t be that um because there&#39;s no y</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:17:00.000" style="s2">chromosome from your mom but right</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.279" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">um but very occasionally you will get</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.000" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">sperm almost entirely from one parent or</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:06.559" style="s2">from the other same with eggs</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.120" style="s2">yeah yeah um actually i want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.559" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">and check</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.120" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">so the sperm will be x bearing or y</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">bearing</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:15.600" style="s2">50 50. right um barring unusual so a</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">sperm could be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.600" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">from the guy who made it made its dad&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:20.559" style="s2">genome</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">but it could not be a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.559" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">from the guy who made its mom&#39;s genome</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:29.280" style="s2">ah uh no because</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">because of an x-bearing sperm could be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.280" end="00:17:32.160" style="s2">hundred percent but a y-bearing spur so</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:34.480" style="s2">half of the sperm</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.160" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">can&#39;t be entirely from the mom&#39;s genome</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.480" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">this is they were in the weeds but</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">so anyway so i don&#39;t i i would be</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">curious whether this</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">result has uh remained robust in all of</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:46.480" style="s2">those years since i</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:48.240" style="s2">last encountered it yeah because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.480" end="00:17:49.679" style="s2">learned a ton about epigenetics among</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.240" end="00:17:52.640" style="s2">other things</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:53.760" style="s2">but in any case even the the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.640" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">preponderance of</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.760" end="00:17:58.320" style="s2">loser genes would not affect the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">likelihood of the sperm</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.320" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">succeeding now there are exceptions</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">to this so what does what does drive</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">which sperm succeeds</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">well so i was going to get to uh</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:13.200" style="s2">intergenomic conflict</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">and sperm sabotage so effective but</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.200" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">that&#39;s with different</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">like that&#39;s that inner genomic conflict</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">uh if the female has made it with more</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:24.960" style="s2">than one male</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:27.600" style="s2">um or no you&#39;re talking about egg versus</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.960" end="00:18:31.360" style="s2">sperm i&#39;m no i&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.600" end="00:18:34.799" style="s2">things like t haplotype in mice</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.360" end="00:18:37.120" style="s2">which sperm that carry one allele</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.799" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">sabotage sperm that carry the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.120" end="00:18:42.080" style="s2">allele so although they reduce</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:44.320" style="s2">the the likelihood of the individual</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.080" end="00:18:45.760" style="s2">making those sperm of fertilizing an egg</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.320" end="00:18:47.679" style="s2">if it fertilizes an egg it will</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.760" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">certainly be the t haplotype so even</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.679" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">though the phenotypes appear to be the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">same if this result from 30 years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:53.679" style="s2">holds</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">there is still antigenomic conflict</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.679" end="00:18:57.200" style="s2">between sperm from the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">dude at the same time yeah there can be</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.200" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">okay right and so and there are many</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">different versions of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">these things t haplotype is the best</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:04.799" style="s2">studied or at least was the best studied</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.919" style="s2">of them but</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.799" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">um so these are uh driving genetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.919" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">elements that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.880" style="s2">that uh sabotage the individual in favor</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">of their own</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.880" end="00:19:16.000" style="s2">continuance which is of course exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">how you would expect genes to behave</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.000" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">yeah and trivers and austin burt have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:20.559" style="s2">now i mean it&#39;s probably been 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:22.080" style="s2">now but they</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.559" end="00:19:24.240" style="s2">they were already sort of working i</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.080" end="00:19:26.559" style="s2">think on their book on</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.240" end="00:19:27.520" style="s2">inter and introgenomic conflict i</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.559" end="00:19:29.600" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.520" end="00:19:31.120" style="s2">um and that&#39;s that&#39;s out now so that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.600" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">could probably look at that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.120" end="00:19:36.320" style="s2">to see what is up to date here um</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">yeah and does this affect humans born</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.320" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">from in vitro fertilization</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">probably um</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.880" style="s2">well in vitro fertilization i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">really know the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.880" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">the mechanism of ivf so the mechanism of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:50.640" style="s2">ivf</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">the primary one is just basically the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.640" end="00:19:55.760" style="s2">physical introduction</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:59.280" style="s2">of genome of sperm genome into</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.760" end="00:20:02.320" style="s2">an egg um so with a needle</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.280" end="00:20:04.240" style="s2">yeah and that can have destructive</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.320" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">effects but i think it&#39;s physically</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.240" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">destructive of the egg right so the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:11.440" style="s2">yeah is about the competition</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:13.280" style="s2">about the competition and whether the</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.440" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">competition between sperm means that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.280" end="00:20:15.440" style="s2">sperm that carry the genes that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.440" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">tend to fertilize the eggs which would</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:21.600" style="s2">in some way purifying so i think what</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">goes on with ivf is</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.600" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">of a very different nature but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:27.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:28.799" style="s2">okay final question from last time would</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.039" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">you rather fight one horse-sized duck or</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.799" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">100 duck-sized horses</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:37.280" style="s2">wait wait wait would i rather fight one</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">duck-sized horse-sized duck</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.280" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">or a hundred duck-sized horses</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.159" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">i&#39;m good either way really oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">that&#39;s cheating you can&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">all right then i would rather fight</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:51.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">i think i&#39;d rather fight the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.679" end="00:20:58.880" style="s2">little horses yeah me too</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">yeah duck-sized horses ducks last words</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">100 ducks it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">like you know if it was 10 it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.400" style="s2">obvious you know one horse sized duck or</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">10 duck size horses but</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.400" end="00:21:10.720" style="s2">um horses that are duck sized it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">going to be pretty easy to take out i</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.720" end="00:21:13.679" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">yeah and they yeah they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">going to be able to do much i mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of them and they and</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">being horses they might team up but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">as long as they&#39;re not rabid rabid</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.919" style="s2">horses yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:26.720" style="s2">couldn&#39;t drag me away rabbit horses</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.919" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">couldn&#39;t drink</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.720" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">no no not a thing okay okay next</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">question this came from the discord</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:36.080" style="s2">ser the discord discussion this week</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">what do you think about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.080" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">there is nowhere on earth to go in order</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">to be a sovereign individual under no</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:44.240" style="s2">jurisdiction but your own there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">opt-out to any and all societies and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.240" end="00:21:49.360" style="s2">this came with a bunch more</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:52.400" style="s2">um sort of background but um fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.360" end="00:21:54.640" style="s2">terrifying sad question oh yeah actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.400" end="00:21:55.919" style="s2">i spent a lot of time thinking about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.640" end="00:21:59.200" style="s2">consequences of this</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.919" end="00:22:02.240" style="s2">yeah um basically it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.200" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">we have signed you up</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.240" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">for a deal that you can&#39;t opt out of who</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.000" style="s2">we the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:10.159" style="s2">civilization yeah and that means that</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.000" end="00:22:11.440" style="s2">civilization has obligations to you that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.159" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not meeting ah</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.440" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">right if it&#39;s gonna sign you up if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">can&#39;t go be a hunter-gatherer somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:21.440" style="s2">right then the point is it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">taking something from you and it has an</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.440" end="00:22:25.360" style="s2">obligation to deliver on</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">its promise to be decent to you and from</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.360" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">this i believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.240" style="s2">that the entire obligation to create</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">societies that</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.240" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">are fair and functional and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:39.440" style="s2">that free people to engage in things</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:42.480" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.440" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">meaningful all of that derives</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.480" end="00:22:45.840" style="s2">from this fact that you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">another choice right that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.840" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.039" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">yeah and anyway yeah i think it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">important principle and i i it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">weirdly as much as it seems deeply</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.159" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">questions here</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:29.440" style="s2">um what do we do absent those like</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:30.240" style="s2">who do we look to absent that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.440" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">person</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.240" end="00:24:34.960" style="s2">now and also how do we make more of them</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">how do we make those people</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.960" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">well i mean this will be uncontroversial</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:40.400" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:42.159" style="s2">you me and most of our audience but one</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.400" end="00:24:45.200" style="s2">thing is you have to stop</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.159" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">demonizing masculinity yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.200" end="00:24:47.279" style="s2">not to say that the people who wield</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:49.760" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.279" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">have to be men right it&#39;s but the point</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.760" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.960" style="s2">those are characteristics that have</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.320" style="s2">traditionally been seen in men</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.960" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">they have been seen in extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.320" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">women who have very often</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:01.760" style="s2">found their names inscribed in history</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">because of it but the point is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.760" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">those characteristics that cause you not</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:11.679" style="s2">obsess over every little slight</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:12.480" style="s2">and to regard being tough and getting</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.679" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">stuff done</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.480" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">and you know stoicism and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:19.279" style="s2">those characteristics need to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:19.840" style="s2">resurrected and being told that they are</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.279" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">toxic</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.840" end="00:25:23.679" style="s2">is itself toxic right it is dangerous to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.679" end="00:25:30.240" style="s2">to tell people that um you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">bucking up and getting the job done is</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.240" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">no longer on the menu because what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:35.440" style="s2">need to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">is you know all come into work and</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.440" end="00:25:37.279" style="s2">immediately cry on each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">shoulders</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.279" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">no right that just doesn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">so how you do that in this era where</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">to even voice that runs the risk of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">you know you being portrayed as uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:55.679" style="s2">callous worse toxic</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that&#39;s the thing we have</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.679" end="00:25:58.480" style="s2">to get around is you&#39;ve got to cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">that stuff in yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.480" end="00:26:02.720" style="s2">right you got to toughen yourself up and</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">you got to not be shy about</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.720" end="00:26:06.320" style="s2">talking to your kids and others about</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.799" style="s2">the fact that these are actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.320" end="00:26:09.440" style="s2">not only desirable characteristics but</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.799" end="00:26:11.679" style="s2">it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.440" end="00:26:12.640" style="s2">necessary not everybody has to have them</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.679" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">but you need</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.640" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">tough people yeah and and to to those</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.679" style="s2">adults who do</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.760" end="00:27:09.200" style="s2">took sick days because they were too</p>

<p begin="00:27:19.919" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">that&#39;s not saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.640" end="00:27:24.159" style="s2">and we saw actually one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.640" end="00:27:27.279" style="s2">examples of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.159" end="00:27:30.000" style="s2">um the proper response to this</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.279" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">uh by the head of coinbase oh i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.000" end="00:27:33.760" style="s2">know i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:35.120" style="s2">a story so this is a ceo who put out a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.760" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">thing that says look</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.120" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">we care about injustice but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">what coinbase is</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">coinbase is about something and we are</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">not going to be able to accomplish it</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">if what we are doing is coming to work</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:49.360" style="s2">the purposes of therapy and so his point</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">was look</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.360" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">leave that stuff at home right and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">taken a tremendous amount of crap for it</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:58.240" style="s2">yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">but here&#39;s the thing can anybody really</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.240" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">doubt that in a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">you know the woke will try to stamp that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:06.720" style="s2">example out because in order for them</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">not to lose there have to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.720" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">no examples of companies that do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.559" style="s2">otherwise what you will get</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">is the hegemony of those who have</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.559" end="00:28:14.960" style="s2">resisted you know we&#39;ve been saying this</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:16.480" style="s2">from the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.960" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got engineering schools that</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.480" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">are woke and other engineering schools</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">that aren&#39;t woke</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:22.880" style="s2">then ultimately the ones that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">woke will will</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.880" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">be in charge of everything because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">will make better bridges and buildings</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.679" style="s2">and all of that other stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">so their stuff is less likely to fail</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.679" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">right and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:35.440" style="s2">you know get out of yourself long enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.760" style="s2">to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.440" end="00:28:40.559" style="s2">that whatever thing you&#39;re trying to fix</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.760" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">with your hard coding of your morality</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.559" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">you&#39;re making it fragile with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">all the things it&#39;s in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">well most of these people advocating for</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">these things uh have never made anything</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">and they wouldn&#39;t recognize the</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:54.559" style="s2">difference between a real thing and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:55.760" style="s2">socially constructed thing clearly but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.559" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">you know based on the fact that they</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.760" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">keep on making</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">ludicrous claims like biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">isn&#39;t real and math isn&#39;t real and</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:03.200" style="s2">you know they they clearly just have</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:04.399" style="s2">long since lost the plot</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.200" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">yeah and why are we listening to them</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.399" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">why is anyone caving to them well</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:10.000" style="s2">unfortunately the answer is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.200" end="00:29:12.720" style="s2">simple</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.000" end="00:29:14.559" style="s2">and pretty mundane right first of all i</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.720" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">do think you know it&#39;s uncomfortable to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.559" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">say but a lot of the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">initiating this are people who intuit</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:21.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">they will not be well served by</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.520" end="00:29:25.760" style="s2">meritocracy they won&#39;t be winners right</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think this is necessarily on</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.760" end="00:29:30.240" style="s2">them i think society has</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:32.399" style="s2">served them very badly and so the fact</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.240" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">that they perceive that in a meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.399" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">they will lose</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">and so they are fighting meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:40.080" style="s2">because actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">that&#39;s the route for them to wellness</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.080" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">that&#39;s something we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">but once they have articulated that</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:47.840" style="s2">and once they are exerting it in a</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.399" style="s2">muscular</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.840" end="00:29:52.320" style="s2">fashion then the game theory for the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.399" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">individual who wants to dodge the</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.320" end="00:29:55.200" style="s2">penalty</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">is to simply embrace it which causes it</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.200" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">to grow and spread</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:29:59.360" style="s2">so it&#39;s like those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">sufficient to explain it</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.360" end="00:30:03.760" style="s2">so two things um by you invoking a</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">muscular fashion for the woke you caused</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.760" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">a cognitive dissonance in my brain that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.399" style="s2">i&#39;m just having a hard time escaping</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.399" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">the most of the most individuals don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">appear to be very muscular</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:16.240" style="s2">it turns out um yes the threat is</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">muscular yes no i know what you meant</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.240" end="00:30:19.360" style="s2">i just like i i got the like the visual</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:21.600" style="s2">image</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.360" end="00:30:23.200" style="s2">muscular phenotype that&#39;s not that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.600" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">what the woke is</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.200" end="00:30:29.039" style="s2">um are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">making the claim which is pretty uh</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.039" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">pretty audacious</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">if you are but i just want to see if i</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:36.559" style="s2">heard you right</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">that many of the people arguing against</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.559" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">effectively enlightenment values</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">which includes the idea of meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:44.799" style="s2">which is not to say that we think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:45.919" style="s2">we have a perfect meritocracy or even</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.799" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.919" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">perfectly obtained in a democratic</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">system but that we can aspire</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.679" style="s2">to it but are you saying that you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:55.600" style="s2">that those who are arguing against it</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.679" end="00:30:57.519" style="s2">are doing so in part because</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.600" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">uh they would not win in a fair</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.519" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">meritocracy that they are somehow they</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.200" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">through through maybe fault of their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.200" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">maybe no fault of their own through some</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.159" style="s2">combination of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.120" style="s2">factors into which they were born and</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.159" end="00:31:10.880" style="s2">handed</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.120" end="00:31:12.320" style="s2">um that they would not be winning and</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.880" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">therefore trying to create a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.320" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">yes but it&#39;s important to get all of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:18.240" style="s2">pieces of that and then to add one so</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">the pieces are all the pieces that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.240" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">just laid out or</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">yes what i don&#39;t want to be lost is you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">know everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">who&#39;s over in that left cabal</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:32.159" style="s2">is a loser my point is those who would</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">argue against meritocracy itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.159" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">i believe have intuited that it would</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">not serve them and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">they have very little to lose in</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.799" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">challenging the idea that it could even</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">work right</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">but the other part i want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:47.360" style="s2">is heard by people</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:49.279" style="s2">is to the extent that you have large</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.360" end="00:31:50.399" style="s2">numbers of people who cannot compete in</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.279" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">a meritocracy</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.399" end="00:31:54.559" style="s2">that is not necessarily their fault in</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:55.919" style="s2">fact right largely is unlikely to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.559" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">their fault it&#39;s the result</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.919" end="00:32:02.080" style="s2">of a system that decided to drug them</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">for profit decided to mis-educate them</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.080" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">so as to create</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">cogs to operate machines that don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:10.240" style="s2">exist anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:11.840" style="s2">so babysat them with screens babysat</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.240" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">them with screens</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.840" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">fed them porn whatever it did it created</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:19.679" style="s2">people who are not well constructed</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:20.240" style="s2">to do [ __ ] and you know gave them junk</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.679" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.240" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">it gave them junk sex junk media junk</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:26.559" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:28.559" style="s2">and so their rebellion is to be expected</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.559" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">but that does not mean that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.559" end="00:32:33.600" style="s2">humor the idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">that the enlightenment was always and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.600" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">only a tool of oppression</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.679" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">that meritocracy is itself a trick</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">you know those things are garbage and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">nonsense and the answer should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">the quicker we get to a meritocracy that</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:49.600" style="s2">where you are incentivized to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">and given the tools with which to do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.600" end="00:32:53.519" style="s2">the better right that&#39;s the thing we</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">want a fair meritocracy well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.519" end="00:32:57.600" style="s2">synonymous but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:59.519" style="s2">yeah um but that&#39;s the objective yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.600" end="00:33:01.440" style="s2">okay suppose we could create a digital</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.519" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">emperor has no clothes mechanism for</p>

<p begin="00:33:10.480" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">be struggling to understand exactly what</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.880" end="00:33:54.799" style="s2">then it becomes a matter of public</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.720" end="00:33:58.080" style="s2">record something like this</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.799" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">would be a total disaster okay um</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.080" end="00:34:01.200" style="s2">yeah because so this is one of these</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:02.880" style="s2">cases where</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.200" end="00:34:04.799" style="s2">i mean i may also that may be none of</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.880" end="00:34:07.440" style="s2">that maybe yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.799" end="00:34:08.480" style="s2">well i can&#39;t can&#39;t figure out exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.440" end="00:34:11.760" style="s2">how it would work</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.480" end="00:34:14.960" style="s2">a we have versions of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.760" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">you know hr is a ham-fisted attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.960" end="00:34:19.839" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:21.200" style="s2">a mechanism to protect people and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.839" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">now been weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.200" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">right but the you know the digital</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.639" end="00:34:27.440" style="s2">emperor has no closed mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">if if the ai can&#39;t get woke right like</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.440" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">hr has been captured hr has gone woke in</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:32.240" style="s2">almost every organization that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">heard about right</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.240" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">and so the idea would be that the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:36.879" style="s2">algorithm can&#39;t go woke the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">can have a lot other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.879" end="00:34:39.760" style="s2">wrong with it but if the algorithm can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:40.639" style="s2">get captured in the same way that hr has</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.760" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">been captured</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">might this not be a way to end run uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:47.440" style="s2">some of some of the problems that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">seeing in organizations my sense is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.440" end="00:34:53.440" style="s2">ai is woke as [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">okay um that why why well because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.440" end="00:34:58.560" style="s2">seen it at places like google where</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.119" style="s2">it picks up ethos and starts trying you</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.560" end="00:35:01.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.119" end="00:35:03.119" style="s2">it it&#39;s it&#39;s a version of the paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.599" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">maximizer</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.119" end="00:35:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s woken it&#39;s in that scenario and</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">sometimes sometimes presumably will feed</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.880" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:14.079" style="s2">you know extreme right ideology if</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.079" end="00:35:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s the area no no it does it does</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.079" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">worse than this and i mean you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.839" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">not to say that it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.960" style="s2">be utilized to anything positive but the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">idea of mechanizing it</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.960" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">actually just adds a layer of</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:29.359" style="s2">hazard and</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.680" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">you know i can imagine if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.040" end="00:35:36.960" style="s2">whistleblower automated whistleblower</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">yada yada</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.960" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">right then the woke would be i mean in</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:43.200" style="s2">fact they already are</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.960" style="s2">right this is this is what i believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.200" end="00:35:46.720" style="s2">happened to the articles of unity</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.960" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">account on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.720" end="00:35:52.480" style="s2">was that a bunch of uh woke</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">folks who didn&#39;t like unity from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.480" end="00:35:57.440" style="s2">beginning because</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t woke um</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.440" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">they reported to twitter</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">triggering an algorithmic process that</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">sidelined the account</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:09.599" style="s2">that then resulted in some person with</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">discretion on the inside</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.599" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">using the excuse so there&#39;s a you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:16.400" style="s2">social media has its own kind of problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:19.920" style="s2">because you can game the social feedback</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.400" end="00:36:21.839" style="s2">thing um but even you know absent</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.920" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">that kind of feedback because why would</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.839" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">you build that into</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:26.160" style="s2">such a mechanism as is being asked here</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.160" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">you still ultimately need the human with</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:31.839" style="s2">discretion and so you&#39;re still dealing</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.079" end="00:36:34.560" style="s2">with a human with discretion</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.839" end="00:36:35.440" style="s2">who is um receiving the outputs of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.560" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">ai</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.440" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">and and that that will always that will</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">always have</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:42.400" style="s2">a potential flaw so we should be getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.200" end="00:36:44.560" style="s2">through more of these uh you</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.400" end="00:36:45.680" style="s2">i see you forming some ironic thing to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">say remembering that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.680" end="00:36:50.960" style="s2">the the movie war game starts with them</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.800" style="s2">removing the people with discretion</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.960" end="00:36:55.359" style="s2">thinking they were solving a problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.800" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">and creating a new problem which i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.359" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">is likely</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.599" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">this is written telegraphically</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:12.000" style="s2">do women have instinct</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:14.160" style="s2">can you read this i can&#39;t i can&#39;t read</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.000" end="00:37:16.720" style="s2">this i can&#39;t i can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.160" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">make sense of this question do women</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.720" end="00:37:20.320" style="s2">have instinct</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">to continually refine women&#39;s intuition</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.320" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">of human behavior to assess</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:26.880" style="s2">trust as an alternative to male reliance</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:30.400" style="s2">on violence</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.880" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">thinking of murder shows um well yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">can&#39;t quite get the exact question out</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.640" style="s2">of there but</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:39.920" style="s2">let&#39;s just say um</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.640" end="00:37:43.280" style="s2">all intuition is about</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.920" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">subtle patterns and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.280" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">the thing that we don&#39;t get about</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">intuition is that we sort of have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:51.440" style="s2">sense that it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">uh you know god-given or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.440" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">more of a scientific materialist you may</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:56.320" style="s2">imagine that it&#39;s written in the genes</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:56.800" style="s2">that you&#39;re wired to perceive certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.320" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">things and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.800" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">undoubtedly you are but the intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:04.640" style="s2">really about</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:06.880" style="s2">experience that is hard to uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.640" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">that is hard to reconcile consciously</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.880" end="00:38:10.079" style="s2">right so you may have the experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">that people</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.079" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">who have a certain you know shifty way</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:17.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">of standing are a hazard or</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.280" end="00:38:20.000" style="s2">untrustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:21.440" style="s2">right it&#39;s very hard to write exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.000" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">what the rule is what you&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.440" end="00:38:25.359" style="s2">noticing</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">but these intuitions can be well tutored</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.359" end="00:38:28.480" style="s2">if they have</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">uh if they&#39;re built on experience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.480" end="00:38:32.240" style="s2">actually informative that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.839" style="s2">more signal than noise they can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.240" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">cruddy if they&#39;re built</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.839" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">on noisy data or pure noise</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:42.400" style="s2">and so anyway yes women&#39;s intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:45.760" style="s2">of course</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.400" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">going to be augmented</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.760" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">uh continual selection</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">whether it&#39;s exactly about male reliance</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:55.280" style="s2">on violence</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.720" style="s2">hard to say undoubtedly women have an</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.280" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">intuition about</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.720" end="00:39:02.720" style="s2">those tendencies of men</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:03.200" style="s2">good something yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.720" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.200" end="00:39:06.800" style="s2">very interesting to be done here that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:10.560" style="s2">maybe maybe we need a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.800" end="00:39:13.599" style="s2">time or words to to pull out</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.560" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">can you our people wolf is</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.599" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">out of control today oh my god she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:17.839" style="s2">terrible um i didn&#39;t say she was</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">terrible</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.839" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">she&#39;s just snorting and rolling around</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.359" style="s2">the floor a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">uh can you comment on yuval harare&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.359" end="00:39:26.960" style="s2">book sapiens is it true that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:28.800" style="s2">cognitive revolution was driven by man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.960" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">ability to create fictions</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">as in money religion states etc also is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:35.359" style="s2">it true that these things are actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">fictions so gosh that&#39;s three different</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.359" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">questions right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">um neither of us i think neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">have read sapiens</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">i read part of it i mean i picked it up</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:46.000" style="s2">and i looked through it a little bit um</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">i i did not not read it because i</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.000" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">thought it was terrible</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">it just didn&#39;t really grab me um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:52.240" style="s2">been recommended by</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:54.000" style="s2">smart people who know something about</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.240" end="00:39:56.320" style="s2">evolution um so</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">you know but neither of us can speak</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.320" end="00:40:00.880" style="s2">directly to whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">um it it struck us as insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.880" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">um but so if we take that part out of it</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:06.800" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">uh address the rest of the question as</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.800" end="00:40:11.040" style="s2">if it is not referring to harare&#39;s book</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">is it true that the cognitive revolution</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.040" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">was driven by man&#39;s ability to create</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">fictions such as money religion and</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">um just taking that question that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:22.960" style="s2">wrong yeah um because our you know the</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.359" style="s2">size of our brain</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.960" end="00:40:28.000" style="s2">just just in terms of not the software</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.359" end="00:40:30.800" style="s2">but the hardware of which we are made</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.000" end="00:40:32.640" style="s2">has been more or less the same on change</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.800" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">for about 200 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.640" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">so um money what are the three things he</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:39.040" style="s2">puts here</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">money religion and states um are all we</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.040" end="00:40:41.680" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">quite a bit newer than 200 000 years old</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.680" end="00:40:46.560" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">the the cognitive revolution um that</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.560" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">allowed us to have the size of brain</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:52.079" style="s2">and specifically the size of prefrontal</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:53.680" style="s2">cortex it allows us to think forward and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.079" end="00:40:56.160" style="s2">reflect backward and tie those</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.680" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">two two things together into the present</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.160" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">uh is much older than these</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">things um and then is it true that these</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">things are actually fictions</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">and they&#39;re not fictions they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">fictions they&#39;re abstractions and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">um human constructs</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">yeah i would say those two things are</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:14.480" style="s2">close kin yeah but uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:15.839" style="s2">human construct does not make a thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.480" end="00:41:20.160" style="s2">fiction no right</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.839" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">um so a what we&#39;ve said elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">what came from dick alexander on this</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:25.200" style="s2">front</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">was that it was an arms race between</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.200" end="00:41:29.440" style="s2">humans at the point that humans become</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">their most prominent hostile force their</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.440" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">own most prominent hostile force</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">that arms race sets up the increase in</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">cognition what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:40.240" style="s2">it means that that cognition was largely</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:42.720" style="s2">built around things like understanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.240" end="00:41:43.599" style="s2">the state of mind of your competitor or</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.720" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">in order to model their behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:51.760" style="s2">parasitize it or challenge it so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:54.960" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good model</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.760" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">um is that unrelated to what you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.960" end="00:41:59.760" style="s2">called fictions and what we would</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.400" style="s2">maybe revise to abstractions it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.760" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">unrelated</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.400" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">right you&#39;re right your competitor&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">mindset</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:08.160" style="s2">is an abstraction to you right and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">can be better or worse</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.160" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">and does that capacity to generate</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:15.359" style="s2">the abstract model of your competitors</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">mindset ultimately result in your</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.359" end="00:42:19.599" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">abstract value to currency from barter</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.599" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">yeah it probably does so it&#39;s related</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">but probably not</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:27.440" style="s2">causal in the way that you lay out here</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:27.839" style="s2">and um i guess just one more thing about</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.440" end="00:42:29.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.839" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">the way that you just built up the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.520" end="00:42:33.200" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">it clearly originates or you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.200" end="00:42:35.280" style="s2">there&#39;s something sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:36.960" style="s2">fundamental than</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.280" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">money religion states which is theory of</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.960" end="00:42:41.280" style="s2">mind you know imagining</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.599" style="s2">what your competitor&#39;s mental state is</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.280" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.599" end="00:42:45.359" style="s2">and recognizing that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:46.560" style="s2">inherently the same as your own which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.359" end="00:42:49.200" style="s2">something that i think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.560" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">two-year-old baby humans uh can begin to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.200" end="00:42:51.920" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">well that&#39;s not even unique to humans so</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.920" end="00:42:54.640" style="s2">you know um</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">there are we we know that for instance</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.640" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">dolphins have theory of mind in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">circumstances elephants do</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:00.880" style="s2">baboon&#39;s terrific book baboon</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.880" end="00:43:05.920" style="s2">um by cheney and seyfarth explores in</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">some depth all the ways that baboons</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.920" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">appear to have theory of mind it can</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:11.359" style="s2">really recognize</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">the ways in which what one baboon may</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.359" end="00:43:14.800" style="s2">feel and desire</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:16.640" style="s2">and understand to be true can also</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.800" end="00:43:17.520" style="s2">recognize that a baboon sitting across</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.640" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.520" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">understands other things to be true and</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">desires different things so</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">you know if it&#39;s and baboons and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:26.400" style="s2">share a most recent common ancestor that</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.800" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">must go back</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.400" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">boy i&#39;m going to be completely making</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.839" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">this up but at least 20 million years</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">i would say if we share most recent</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:34.400" style="s2">common ancestors with chimps and</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">madoba&#39;s at 6 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.400" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">the other apes probably 10 12 you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:40.480" style="s2">are basically baboons or old world</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">monkeys and so that&#39;s gotta be at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.480" end="00:43:43.520" style="s2">20 million years ago i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:45.680" style="s2">they&#39;re all world monkeys and old school</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.520" end="00:43:46.720" style="s2">monkeys no they&#39;re definitely old school</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.680" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">yeah yeah absolutely wrapped on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.720" end="00:43:55.119" style="s2">knuckles really</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">og yeah original gangster monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.119" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">got it yep okay um</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:01.680" style="s2">is there an adaptive use to something</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">like bullying</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.680" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">also what&#39;s up with mail pattern</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">baldness</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:10.000" style="s2">is that an attack yeah why does that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">persist when it seems to be a handicap</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.000" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">so that is two questions</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">uh maybe we&#39;ll do just do one of them</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:16.640" style="s2">since uh we want to get through more of</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:18.800" style="s2">these which one do you want to take on</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.640" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">male pattern baldness or bullying</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.800" end="00:44:22.560" style="s2">uh bullying okay um by the way this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.560" end="00:44:28.960" style="s2">i&#39;m if i have male pattern baldness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">a hundred years behind schedule yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.960" end="00:44:33.280" style="s2">um trans men begin to experience male</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">pattern baldness which</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.280" end="00:44:37.520" style="s2">suggests that it is a direct effect</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.640" style="s2">mechanistically of testosterone</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.520" end="00:44:44.319" style="s2">yeah yeah um okay so</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.640" end="00:44:48.079" style="s2">bullying first of all</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.319" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">this is part of bullying may be the</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.079" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">pathological version of something</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:53.200" style="s2">for which i think actually in this case</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">we maybe do</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.200" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">have uh non-patho pathological names for</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">the things that are short of it but</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:02.640" style="s2">one wants to be very careful if you take</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">all of the things that could be</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.640" end="00:45:08.319" style="s2">portrayed as bullying</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">out of the schoolyard you will get</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.319" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">fragile snowflakey kids yep right</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:17.200" style="s2">if you want to create robust adults that</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:19.359" style="s2">can endure stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.200" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">then they need to be exposed to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.359" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">including not so nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">uh colleagues giving them a hard time on</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:30.880" style="s2">the playground and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:31.200" style="s2">bullying toughens you up and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.880" end="00:45:33.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.200" end="00:45:34.640" style="s2">probably better off being toughened up</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.520" end="00:45:37.119" style="s2">by the</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.640" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">kid in your school yard who&#39;s maybe a</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">being pampered through school and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">getting out into the real world and</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:47.520" style="s2">running into somebody who really has you</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">just a little bit here i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.520" end="00:45:57.680" style="s2">just in a conversation i don&#39;t think you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">know this</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.680" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">um while editing the childhood chapter i</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:03.119" style="s2">was either the childhood or the school</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:08.560" style="s2">of our book um and i i had made a claim</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:12.000" style="s2">i&#39;d written something and made a claim</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.560" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">about uh bullies uh having</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.000" end="00:46:16.160" style="s2">very short-term success but long-term</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">being you know losing power</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.160" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">in in the scenario in those situations</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.680" style="s2">where bullies are allowed to persist and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:23.359" style="s2">that the children themselves</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.680" end="00:46:25.599" style="s2">hopefully in mixed age groups are</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.359" end="00:46:26.960" style="s2">allowed to basically do</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.599" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">do the business on their own without</p>

<p begin="00:46:30.400" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">um and i realized that i just i had this</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.400" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">in my head but i didn&#39;t have a reference</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">for it and i couldn&#39;t find one so i</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">approached lenore skinesi our friend who</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">is the founder of among other things let</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:47.760" style="s2">grow uh she became famous many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:48.560" style="s2">as uh the nation&#39;s worst mom i think</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.760" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">when she</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.560" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">lef um allowed her then nine-year-old</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">maybe to ride the new york subway</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:57.200" style="s2">um and of course she is very much not</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">the nation&#39;s worst mom</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.200" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">um in fact she&#39;s probably one of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">best and she has become quite an</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">advocate for free play</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.359" end="00:47:06.720" style="s2">and unstructured play and unsupervised</p>

<p begin="00:47:06.720" end="00:47:10.560" style="s2">and i asked her and she said she i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:14.400" style="s2">know but peter gray</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.560" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">who is a researcher on play not just in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.400" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">american children specifically in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:19.119" style="s2">sudbury schools</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">which have a lot of unstructured play</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.119" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">with mixed age groups but also in</p>

<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.319" style="s2">she put me in touch with him and in</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.880" end="00:47:28.559" style="s2">conversation with him an email</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.319" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">conversation with with peter gray</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.559" end="00:47:32.559" style="s2">he says you know i have no references to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">to support this but</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.559" end="00:47:35.760" style="s2">i i know that it&#39;s something i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:38.640" style="s2">and i also</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">i can also point to um other personal</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.640" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">observations</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:42.400" style="s2">of other researchers from various</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies so from</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.400" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">hunter-gatherer societies from</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:48.800" style="s2">pre-industrial societies</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:51.839" style="s2">to the playgrounds at sudbury schools in</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.800" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">in the new in new england uh yes this</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.839" end="00:47:57.440" style="s2">would seem to be the case that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:58.880" style="s2">bullies um are uh are a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.440" end="00:48:01.200" style="s2">that show up over and over and over</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.880" end="00:48:02.640" style="s2">again and under circumstances where</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.200" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">children are allowed</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.640" end="00:48:06.079" style="s2">to deal with their own troubles uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">bullies tend to lose</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.079" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">in the end yeah bully is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:11.359" style="s2">strategy right</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">right and so again i want to draw the</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.359" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">distinction</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">bully might be the pathological version</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:17.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:18.880" style="s2">giving your you know taking the piss out</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">of your friends</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.880" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">might be the wholesome version of it</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:24.319" style="s2">that results in you knowing where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.760" style="s2">vulnerable fixing the problem being</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.319" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">stronger in the end and all of those</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.760" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">things and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t want to defend bullying</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">because maybe it&#39;s just bad but</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s you know it&#39;s bad like uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">water is bad when you drown right you</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:40.800" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s not an indictment of water no</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:42.559" style="s2">i mean and there were boys i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:44.000" style="s2">this is actually one of the themes of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.559" end="00:48:45.920" style="s2">the way that we think this evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.000" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">lens you know dyslexia</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.920" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">maladaptive or adaptive right like oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:50.480" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:53.119" style="s2">um you can&#39;t actually do it that way</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.480" end="00:48:56.160" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t do it that way</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.119" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">okay my ten-year-old son</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:48:59.839" style="s2">david i apologize if i mispronouncing</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:02.079" style="s2">his name my ten-year-old son</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.839" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">david wants to know the egg the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.079" end="00:49:04.319" style="s2">chicken is born in is it really a</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:06.880" style="s2">chicken egg</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.319" end="00:49:08.960" style="s2">or an egg of a pre-chicken if the latter</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.880" end="00:49:10.480" style="s2">then chicken came first not the egg we</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.960" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">love your voice of sanity stay</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.480" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">safe yeah you&#39;ve resurrected</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">the chicken and egg problem which was</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:20.240" style="s2">neatly solved well it resurrects it only</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">really if you add</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.240" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">a little semantic thing to the question</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">which came first</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:28.000" style="s2">the chicken or the chicken egg yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">right and so that you know that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.000" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">in fact the question as it usually is</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">asked and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:35.839" style="s2">but um</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">but really you know which came first the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.839" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">chicken or the egg clearly the egg</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">because eggs predate chickens which came</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">first the chicken or the chicken egg</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:47.040" style="s2">which is what this</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:50.160" style="s2">uh this question resurrects perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.040" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">what do you think well i mean look let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.160" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">i am not a fan of sophistry but were you</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:58.559" style="s2">to get involved in sophistry were you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:02.400" style="s2">take it up maybe as a hobby</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.559" end="00:50:05.839" style="s2">you could make an argument that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.400" end="00:50:08.559" style="s2">chicken came first because the eggshell</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.839" end="00:50:10.400" style="s2">goes on after the chicken egg is</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.559" end="00:50:14.640" style="s2">fertilized</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.400" end="00:50:17.440" style="s2">little known fact um and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.640" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">if the chicken is synonymous with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.440" end="00:50:22.319" style="s2">zygote</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:24.240" style="s2">then the chicken shell came second</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.319" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">again that&#39;s pure sophistication okay</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.240" end="00:50:27.200" style="s2">you want you want to play at sophistry</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">yeah i do</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.200" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">yeah okay so in what universe mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">is that how we play at soviet street do</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:34.240" style="s2">we begin our questions where they want</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:35.839" style="s2">universe in what universe</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.240" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a good start that was threatening</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.839" end="00:50:40.079" style="s2">yeah in what universe do you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">that the egg and the eggshell are</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:44.319" style="s2">synonymous</p>

<p begin="00:50:50.559" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">terrible answer i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.000" end="00:50:55.839" style="s2">i i don&#39;t think so so yeah so then we</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:57.520" style="s2">have a temporal</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.839" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">um thing which you know which came first</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.520" end="00:50:59.359" style="s2">the question is already temporal but</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.359" end="00:51:04.400" style="s2">the egg exists and then the egg stops</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:06.160" style="s2">being formed and somewhere in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.400" end="00:51:08.480" style="s2">of the egg being formed the chicken</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.160" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">comes to be oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.480" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">it depends it depends on what the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:15.119" style="s2">definition of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">is is at some level this is why this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.119" end="00:51:20.079" style="s2">why i dislike sophistry as a mode of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:21.680" style="s2">analysis</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.079" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">yes did you know that the sophists were</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.680" end="00:51:25.280" style="s2">paid tutors</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">were paid to be pain in the asses yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">pains depends on how many people paid</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:36.559" style="s2">them how many asses you&#39;ve got yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">yeah all right in a debate dyson a</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.559" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">preacher</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">called jordan peterson a mean old white</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:43.440" style="s2">man and an upholder of patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">then he invited jordan peterson to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">black church if absence of religion</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:52.079" style="s2">creates a void for wokeness to fill</p>

<p begin="00:51:52.079" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">you know i might the very short answer</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.720" end="00:51:59.680" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:02.240" style="s2">you know nothing dyson did in that uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.680" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">you know well-known debate looked like</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.240" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">honorable</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:06.800" style="s2">christianity or religiosity to me and</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">you know and i say that with no</p>

<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:13.359" style="s2">religiosity to me but um</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:14.960" style="s2">nothing in the teachings of jesus uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.359" end="00:52:16.319" style="s2">suggests that calling peop</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.640" style="s2">someone a medial white man or an</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.319" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">upholder of patriarchy has anything to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.640" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">do with</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:24.960" style="s2">uh that&#39;s just inconsistent with what</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.960" style="s2">the new testament is trying to inform</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.960" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">people of as a way to behave</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.960" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">yeah so um it&#39;s i think i think he</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.079" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">dyson whatever his name is uh eric</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">michael maybe</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:39.920" style="s2">um is just a hypocrite and he&#39;s he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">he&#39;s not an upstanding religious person</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.920" end="00:52:43.440" style="s2">as he would appear to be if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:44.880" style="s2">inviting peterson to a black church or</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.440" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">if he is he&#39;s got work to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.880" end="00:52:50.079" style="s2">he&#39;s not getting it right okay um you</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">know and for one thing i mean we can say</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.079" end="00:52:53.200" style="s2">jordan&#39;s a friend he&#39;s not a mean old</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">white guy yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.200" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">he&#39;s a bit traditional in some ways that</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:52:58.720" style="s2">we&#39;re different but</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">but also not an upholder of patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.720" end="00:53:01.920" style="s2">not an uphold or patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.920" style="s2">in fact he&#39;s a fan of the ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.920" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">we are different right right so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.920" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">you know uh sort of rooting for that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">difference to</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:10.400" style="s2">to be dealt with responsibly and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:14.240" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:17.920" style="s2">um he&#39;s a cool guy he feels</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.240" end="00:53:20.480" style="s2">other people&#39;s uh tribulations</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.920" end="00:53:21.599" style="s2">intensely which is not something that a</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.480" end="00:53:24.559" style="s2">mean old white guy</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.599" end="00:53:25.839" style="s2">does right he&#39;s somebody who cares a</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.559" end="00:53:28.880" style="s2">great deal and it has</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.839" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">been very costly to him so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.880" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">yes i would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:34.559" style="s2">uh dyson missed it by one mechanism or</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.559" end="00:53:39.520" style="s2">yeah your dog is almost under your chair</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.520" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">be aware you&#39;ve stated men and women</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:45.359" style="s2">need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">know renegotiate terms i agree</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.359" end="00:53:48.880" style="s2">specifically in regards to child rearing</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:50.640" style="s2">what would be the ideal arrangement for</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.880" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">parents to feel fulfilled at home and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.640" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">work both part time every other day</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:57.280" style="s2">question mark</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">boy it&#39;s going to depend on all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.280" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">particulars yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:03.839" style="s2">all right um we</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">were in a really lucky position when our</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.839" end="00:54:08.160" style="s2">kids were were</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">tiny because we both had</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.160" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">full-time jobs that allowed such</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:14.079" style="s2">flexibility um</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">and we had on-campus child care that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.079" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">allowed us to do part-time</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:21.680" style="s2">such that we could you know really both</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">be co-parenting in every regard with the</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.680" end="00:54:24.079" style="s2">exception of the anatomically mandated</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:25.680" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.079" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">yeah which is to say once they&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.680" end="00:54:31.359" style="s2">just just breastfeeding</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:33.920" style="s2">yeah and we had almost zero commute</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.960" style="s2">we lived walking distance from work and</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.920" end="00:54:36.880" style="s2">the kids daycare</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.960" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">and biking distances and biking distance</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.880" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">and we biked with the kids</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">to daycare dropped them off uh we had</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">special tandems and</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:46.640" style="s2">used them to drop the kids at daycare so</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:48.079" style="s2">that was really good they were writing</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.640" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">by the time they were two they were each</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.079" end="00:54:53.520" style="s2">on the back of the kidback tandem</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">yep but all of this the symmetry allowed</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.520" end="00:54:58.240" style="s2">you know the symmetry in our both our</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:01.119" style="s2">jobs</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.240" end="00:55:02.480" style="s2">and and all of that was really useful</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.119" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">from the point of view of not having to</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.480" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">divide up the</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">labor of it too much there&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:08.960" style="s2">stuff that you do there are novel</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">opportunities which</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.960" end="00:55:15.680" style="s2">you know the um the interesting one</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:19.520" style="s2">is breast pumping</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.680" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">allows some of the feeding</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.520" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">to be done by the father now is that a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:27.520" style="s2">idea and there&#39;s at least one way in</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">which it&#39;s a hazardous idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.520" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">which has to do with the fact that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">breast milk</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">has circadian messages in it yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.960" end="00:55:37.839" style="s2">let&#39;s just give a shout out here to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">josie josie jarvis</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.839" end="00:55:42.319" style="s2">who was one of our students who um um</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">this this is an idea that is a little</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.319" end="00:55:45.680" style="s2">bit out there in the literature but she</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:47.119" style="s2">really dove deep and actually i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.680" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">in contact with her a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.119" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">this is another idea that hopefully is</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.119" style="s2">going to end up in the book</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">but the circadian information the</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.119" end="00:55:56.400" style="s2">information that&#39;s in breast milk that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">is circadian in nature</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.400" end="00:55:59.520" style="s2">may mean for instance that if you pump</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:01.119" style="s2">breast milk</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.520" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">in the hopes that for instance your</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.119" end="00:56:04.960" style="s2">partner who&#39;s not lactating</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.119" style="s2">can do a feeding in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.960" end="00:56:09.119" style="s2">night and that partner gives the baby</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.119" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">breast mouth that was pumped at noon</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.119" end="00:56:13.520" style="s2">you might actually wake that kid up and</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:14.240" style="s2">render a night without sleep for any of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.520" end="00:56:15.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.240" end="00:56:17.520" style="s2">whereas if you pay attention to when it</p>

<p begin="00:56:17.520" end="00:56:21.280" style="s2">expressed</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">um uh that you do a very much better job</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.280" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">of getting your kid under some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:25.599" style="s2">circadian cycle it is very much more</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:29.119" style="s2">like the one that you were on</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.599" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">right yeah so anyway yes that yeah um so</p>

<p begin="00:56:35.119" end="00:56:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s going to be harder</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:40.000" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.400" end="00:56:41.520" style="s2">symmetrical if you don&#39;t already have</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.000" end="00:56:42.720" style="s2">symmetrical stuff and yeah we didn&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.520" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">didn&#39;t plan it out that way we just</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.720" end="00:56:44.960" style="s2">ended up with like literally identical</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">jobs</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.960" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">yeah right um and living really close to</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">both our jobs</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">and the daycare which was part of part</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.319" end="00:56:52.160" style="s2">of the jobs and really at that point the</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:54.240" style="s2">daycare was</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.160" end="00:56:56.160" style="s2">was exquisite it was so good and we</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.240" end="00:56:59.440" style="s2">could do it part-time and all of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.160" end="00:57:00.720" style="s2">um that said there is real value in</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.440" end="00:57:03.599" style="s2">division of labor</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.720" end="00:57:04.720" style="s2">and many of the ways that male and</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.599" end="00:57:07.119" style="s2">female roles</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.720" end="00:57:08.799" style="s2">have been divided in the past are no</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.119" end="00:57:11.200" style="s2">longer necessary</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.799" end="00:57:12.559" style="s2">some of them will persist for anatomic</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.200" end="00:57:15.200" style="s2">and physiological reasons</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.559" end="00:57:16.720" style="s2">uh some of them will persist for um</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.200" end="00:57:18.559" style="s2">persistent differences</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.720" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">in sex well i guess this is still</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.559" end="00:57:21.040" style="s2">anatomic and physiological like you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.040" end="00:57:26.079" style="s2">the study that i like to bring up this</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:28.720" style="s2">provost murdoch 1973 review</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.079" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">of pre-industrial uh societies finds</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.720" end="00:57:31.040" style="s2">that in every society they looked at</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:34.799" style="s2">that has</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.040" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">uh you know marine mammal hunting</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.799" end="00:57:38.079" style="s2">it&#39;s always the men who do it this just</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:39.440" style="s2">isn&#39;t something that you send women to</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.079" end="00:57:40.079" style="s2">do also you don&#39;t send women into the</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.440" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">mines</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.079" end="00:57:44.240" style="s2">yeah and i should say none of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">three things showed up in our</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.240" end="00:57:47.839" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:49.200" style="s2">yes you you never hunted whales went</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.839" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">down to the mountains always catch and</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.200" end="00:57:51.359" style="s2">release</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">although i mean the third one that i say</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.359" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">i know you&#39;re joking</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:57.520" style="s2">yeah especially with the blue whales</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">yeah wow yeah it&#39;s just hard to get him</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.520" end="00:58:02.240" style="s2">in the boat for anything yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:02.640" style="s2">you might need a bigger boat i yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:04.799" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.640" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">but you know with lumbering i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.799" end="00:58:08.000" style="s2">when this tree fell on our driveway</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:10.640" style="s2">in the windstorm that just before</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.000" end="00:58:11.680" style="s2">smokopolis um</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.640" end="00:58:14.000" style="s2">you know you were the guy with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.680" end="00:58:15.520" style="s2">chainsaw and you know i like i</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.000" end="00:58:17.119" style="s2">i know my way around a lot of power</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.520" end="00:58:18.480" style="s2">tools and i&#39;ve enjoyed making a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.119" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">things a lot of power tools and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.480" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">chainsaws ain&#39;t one of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:23.520" style="s2">and uh you know that&#39;s it it could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:25.200" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.520" end="00:58:27.440" style="s2">right it absolutely could be different</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.200" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">but um you know most of these gender</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.440" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">norms</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">um don&#39;t need to be the way they are</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:34.160" style="s2">anymore but it&#39;s also true that across</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:35.520" style="s2">cultures there are a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.160" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">gendered activities</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.520" end="00:58:39.359" style="s2">that it depends on the culture as to</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:40.960" style="s2">which gender does it so you know weaving</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.359" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">for instance is highly gendered in most</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.960" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">cultures that have been looked at</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:46.799" style="s2">but sometimes it&#39;s only women who do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:49.280" style="s2">and sometimes it&#39;s only men who do it</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.799" end="00:58:50.400" style="s2">and that suggests not that men or women</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.280" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">are better at weaving</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.400" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">but that there is a value in having</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:55.440" style="s2">gendered activities</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">so that itself is something that we can</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.440" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">unpack what now</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:02.559" style="s2">i was just going to say that lumbering</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:06.559" style="s2">about is the province of men</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.559" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">i suppose um and weaving can be either</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.559" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">depending on the alcohol women do not</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:13.920" style="s2">weave well enough alone</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:14.960" style="s2">oh wow oh that&#39;s where we&#39;re going i</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.920" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.960" end="00:59:20.000" style="s2">yeah um so yeah obviously we can</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.079" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">we can talk about this for for a long</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:24.079" style="s2">time but maybe we&#39;ll stop there for</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">for now zach how long are we at uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.079" end="00:59:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;re about 50 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:34.319" style="s2">50. okay well uh we are going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.880" end="00:59:35.920" style="s2">stop there for for okay sorry</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.319" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">uh we&#39;re not gonna stop stop we are</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.920" end="00:59:41.920" style="s2">going to um</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:45.760" style="s2">move to this hour&#39;s super chat questions</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.920" end="00:59:46.000" style="s2">okay i am a public school teacher being</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.760" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">told</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.000" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">that i must return to in-person school</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">in two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">i&#39;m in multiple high-risk categories if</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.559" style="s2">you were in my shoes would you return to</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:56.240" style="s2">work or quit</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.559" end="00:59:58.559" style="s2">quitting halfway through my contract may</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.240" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">affect future employment</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.559" end="01:00:06.480" style="s2">oh my god yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:09.760" style="s2">boy i mean it it depends</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.480" end="01:00:11.839" style="s2">not just on your risk from covid</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.760" end="01:00:13.599" style="s2">but your financial risk from not working</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.839" end="01:00:17.599" style="s2">and potentially not being able to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.599" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">more work yep well i would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.599" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">you want to think very carefully about</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.920" style="s2">unfortunately the problem is at the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">beginning</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.920" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">you&#39;re liable and we don&#39;t know where</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">you&#39;re writing from but no</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:35.280" style="s2">um you know if you were in la</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">then you might be able to use open</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.280" end="01:00:39.440" style="s2">windows</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">and fans or something yep to reduce your</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.440" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">risk a great deal</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">you know in conjunction with a good mask</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:46.319" style="s2">yeah you could do something like that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:47.599" style="s2">yeah so there&#39;s not only is the answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.319" end="01:00:49.359" style="s2">going to be different depending on both</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.599" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">your risk from covet and your financial</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.359" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">risk but also</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:53.440" style="s2">geography so that&#39;s that&#39;s just a third</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">thing here in</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.440" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">a column of things to think about yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.200" end="01:00:59.119" style="s2">so anyway what i would say is</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">yeah we can&#39;t we can&#39;t really help you</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.119" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">with the analysis</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:03.599" style="s2">fully because you do have these two</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:07.200" style="s2">competing things and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.599" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">anything about one of them yeah um but</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.200" end="01:01:13.280" style="s2">you can within whatever</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.359" end="01:01:14.720" style="s2">risk is coming to you from your</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.280" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">environment do</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.720" end="01:01:19.040" style="s2">an awful lot to protect yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:21.920" style="s2">reduce the likelihood</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.040" end="01:01:23.280" style="s2">of your getting sick and if you do get</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:24.640" style="s2">sick reduce the likelihood that it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.280" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">severe so i would say yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.640" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">so viral load being an indicator a good</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:31.119" style="s2">predictor of</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">both whether or not you get sick so</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.119" end="01:01:34.240" style="s2">exposure to</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.880" end="01:01:37.040" style="s2">the amount of virus to which you are</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.240" end="01:01:39.280" style="s2">exposed is a good predictor of both</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.040" end="01:01:41.119" style="s2">uh whether you get sick or not and if</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.280" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">you do get sick how sick you get</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.119" end="01:01:44.799" style="s2">both of those things and the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:48.720" style="s2">i would say that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.799" end="01:01:51.040" style="s2">very big one is vitamin d right so</p>

<p begin="01:01:52.079" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">d but vitamin d appears to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">one of the most protective things that</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:03.119" style="s2">you can</p>

<p begin="01:02:07.920" end="01:02:11.200" style="s2">nobody&#39;s pushing vitamin d there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.520" end="01:02:14.240" style="s2">profit in it yeah</p>

<p begin="01:03:08.480" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">beautiful saturday</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">by most by most metrics um there weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:16.559" style="s2">a ton of other people out there</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:18.319" style="s2">but you know no one&#39;s masked as they</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.559" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be if they&#39;re alone in a boat</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.319" end="01:03:20.720" style="s2">or in a kayak or on a stand-up paddle</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:22.400" style="s2">board or fishing there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.720" end="01:03:25.839" style="s2">people fishing out today</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.400" end="01:03:28.079" style="s2">um and why</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.839" end="01:03:30.079" style="s2">not have people selling fishing gear and</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.079" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">stand-up paddleboards and kayaks</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.079" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">and you know other things that you do</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:37.520" style="s2">hiking boots you know why doesn&#39;t rai</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:39.280" style="s2">like why aren&#39;t a lot of these places</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.520" end="01:03:41.760" style="s2">that actually their business model is</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.280" end="01:03:44.079" style="s2">about getting outside and being outside</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.760" end="01:03:45.440" style="s2">um they could start to do this that</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.079" end="01:03:46.799" style="s2">would be both a public service and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.440" end="01:03:50.160" style="s2">would help their bottom line</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.799" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">so um i fully agree with that that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.160" end="01:03:53.520" style="s2">ought to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">heavily emphasizing those things which</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.520" end="01:03:56.640" style="s2">are protective which</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">you know oftentimes you should be doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.640" end="01:04:01.200" style="s2">anyway yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:02.640" style="s2">but yesterday i was at a ups store i</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.200" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">needed to get something notarized and</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.640" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">there was a line</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.160" end="01:04:07.440" style="s2">and i was in there and the line was</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.720" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.440" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">it was inside even though it was like 74</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">degrees outside and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:15.280" style="s2">well they had the door open yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:16.880" style="s2">anyway as i&#39;m standing there in line and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.280" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">the line is moving very slowly i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.880" end="01:04:20.640" style="s2">thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:21.200" style="s2">model about okay has anybody sick been</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.640" end="01:04:23.039" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.200" end="01:04:24.960" style="s2">do they stand in line for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.039" end="01:04:28.640" style="s2">exhaling is this room</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.960" end="01:04:29.839" style="s2">full up with high viral load in which</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.640" end="01:04:31.039" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.839" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not like you get it</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.039" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">instantly but it means that if you</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:34.880" style="s2">continue to breathe it eventually you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:36.319" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.880" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">anyway i made an arrangement with the</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.319" end="01:04:39.920" style="s2">guy i was in line in front of that i was</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:40.960" style="s2">going to go stand outside as long as i</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.920" end="01:04:44.160" style="s2">was waiting</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.960" end="01:04:45.920" style="s2">right that was not</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.160" end="01:04:47.599" style="s2">a perfectly straightforward thing to</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.920" end="01:04:49.359" style="s2">negotiate but the point is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.599" end="01:04:50.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve got a good model then you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.359" end="01:04:53.119" style="s2">look at the situation and you can say</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.880" end="01:04:56.799" style="s2">okay what can i do here to drop</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.119" end="01:04:58.880" style="s2">my risk to a level that i can accept it</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.799" end="01:05:00.319" style="s2">and i&#39;m just curious i don&#39;t know which</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.880" end="01:05:02.079" style="s2">ups store you&#39;re at but would it have</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.319" end="01:05:04.000" style="s2">been possible for them to have the line</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.079" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">outside the store</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.000" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">they could have yes and we should we</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.280" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:10.880" style="s2">want them to do exactly that like give</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.280" end="01:05:12.960" style="s2">it another month and that won&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.880" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">sense right so if there&#39;s no awnings</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.960" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">you know it might be pouring and in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:16.880" style="s2">lot of parts of the country it would</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:19.760" style="s2">just be too cold</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.880" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">um potentially but um you know i i feel</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.760" end="01:05:24.240" style="s2">like i would</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.559" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">always prefer to be outside</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.240" end="01:05:30.480" style="s2">than inside in a enclosed space</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:32.799" style="s2">where you don&#39;t know who&#39;s been sick and</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.480" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">from the point of view of the employees</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.799" end="01:05:36.799" style="s2">it makes a ton of sense to have all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">that exhaling done outside the building</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.799" end="01:05:41.039" style="s2">where it dissipates naturally rather</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:42.799" style="s2">than accumulating there one sick person</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.039" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">could get every employee sick so</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.799" end="01:05:48.400" style="s2">yeah okay next question</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.599" style="s2">thank you for helping putting the thank</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.400" end="01:05:53.599" style="s2">you for helping put the unity in</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.599" end="01:05:55.920" style="s2">humanity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.599" end="01:05:57.280" style="s2">a stretch yeah spelling level but uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.920" end="01:05:58.240" style="s2">you&#39;re welcome well</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.280" end="01:06:02.160" style="s2">he found the letters in there they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:06:02.160" end="01:06:06.799" style="s2">given ali okay so this one um</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.520" end="01:06:08.960" style="s2">we were told might have been asked a</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.799" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">little uh oddly just because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.960" end="01:06:12.319" style="s2">struggling with character limits let me</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:13.200" style="s2">see if i can figure it out maybe you can</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.319" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">help me</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.200" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.839" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.599" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s basically this is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.839" end="01:06:20.799" style="s2">question about negative assortative</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.599" end="01:06:23.760" style="s2">mating so let me just</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.799" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">um give a little background first on um</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.760" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">in evolutionary biology we talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:30.319" style="s2">assortative mating</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:32.640" style="s2">in which mate choice is based on</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.319" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">particular characteristics and positive</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.640" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">assertive mating</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">um is it&#39;s not a value judgment it</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:39.520" style="s2">suggests that okay if i have blonde hair</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:41.440" style="s2">which i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.520" end="01:06:43.119" style="s2">uh positive assertive mating for that</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.440" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">character would be me looking for a mate</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">with blonde hair</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">whereas negative assorted mating would</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:50.000" style="s2">be me looking for a trait with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.480" style="s2">with the opposite valence um so for you</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.000" end="01:06:53.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.480" end="01:06:54.400" style="s2">dark hair uh so in with that framework</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.359" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">of positive</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.400" end="01:06:58.160" style="s2">versus negative assertive mating this</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">person is basically</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.160" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">asked um</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.400" end="01:07:09.599" style="s2">why women are often women in particular</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.119" end="01:07:11.359" style="s2">more often than men are more likely to</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.599" end="01:07:12.000" style="s2">engage in negative assorted mating</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.359" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.000" end="01:07:16.799" style="s2">race and if that is the tr</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">if that is true so first we have this</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.799" end="01:07:21.920" style="s2">observation that&#39;s a claim</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:25.039" style="s2">if that observation is true given</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.920" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">um that alleles are are interested</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.039" end="01:07:29.119" style="s2">uh in uh furthering themselves why</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:30.559" style="s2">basically why would you ever have</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.119" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">negative assertive mating</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.559" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">well this is a great question yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:33.680" style="s2">again i don&#39;t know if the pattern is</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:36.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.680" end="01:07:38.799" style="s2">yeah but you have to factor in lots of</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.960" end="01:07:40.319" style="s2">oh hold on just the final question here</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.799" end="01:07:41.839" style="s2">was are they looking for immunological</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.319" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">enhancement for offspring that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.839" end="01:07:44.319" style="s2">that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">possible explanation for why if the</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.319" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">observation is true it might be true</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.839" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">possibly but not necessarily so i would</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.559" end="01:07:56.240" style="s2">say look first of all there&#39;s a general</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:56.960" style="s2">category of something called hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.240" end="01:07:59.440" style="s2">vigor</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.960" end="01:08:00.799" style="s2">right and i would say hybrid vigor you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.440" end="01:08:03.760" style="s2">know in the narrow</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.799" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">sense if you take two purebred dogs</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.760" end="01:08:07.839" style="s2">they&#39;re liable to have</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:10.880" style="s2">pathologies purebred dogs often do</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.839" end="01:08:14.160" style="s2">if you breed them together</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.880" end="01:08:17.759" style="s2">their offspring get the benefit</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.160" end="01:08:18.640" style="s2">of uh genetic diversity and different</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.759" end="01:08:21.920" style="s2">breeds</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.640" end="01:08:25.359" style="s2">right right right that&#39;s what i mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.920" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">so i mean same thing same thing over</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.359" end="01:08:28.319" style="s2">with cats</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">right you you know pure breeds often</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.319" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">have particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:32.880" style="s2">problems that they reliably have whereas</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:36.159" style="s2">you get um what you have dubbed</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.880" end="01:08:38.719" style="s2">the epic tabby uh sub sub breed</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.159" end="01:08:40.880" style="s2">yeah which you know tabi&#39;s are are mutts</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.719" end="01:08:42.480" style="s2">at one level they&#39;re not exactly mutts</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.880" end="01:08:43.920" style="s2">um although you know when they have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.480" end="01:08:46.960" style="s2">white and the tabby with them</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.920" end="01:08:48.640" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty muddy and uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.960" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">boy have we had a number of these epic</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.640" end="01:08:52.239" style="s2">tabbies that are just you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:53.120" style="s2">extraordinary in terms of their you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.239" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">it&#39;s going to sound like we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.120" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">bragging about our cats but like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:58.799" style="s2">couple of cats with this particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.080" style="s2">phenotype that are extraordinary</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.799" end="01:09:02.000" style="s2">cognitively yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.080" end="01:09:04.560" style="s2">they do seem to be a little too clever</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.000" end="01:09:07.120" style="s2">for their own good sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.560" end="01:09:07.759" style="s2">but in any case the hybrid vigor thing i</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:10.799" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.759" end="01:09:11.679" style="s2">arises a lot because of the deficits of</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.799" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">purebreds</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.679" end="01:09:18.080" style="s2">rather than because uh mixing is always</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">good in fact yes you know there&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.080" end="01:09:22.319" style="s2">inbreeding depression there&#39;s deficits</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:25.040" style="s2">from breeding too close to home</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.319" end="01:09:25.839" style="s2">and there are costs from breeding too</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.040" end="01:09:29.359" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.839" end="01:09:31.040" style="s2">and then you know purebreds uh have some</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.359" end="01:09:32.799" style="s2">hybrid vigor when you mix them so the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.040" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">distinction you&#39;re making is it might be</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.799" end="01:09:37.920" style="s2">just avoidance of cost</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">not um adding unknown benefits well in</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.920" end="01:09:40.719" style="s2">the case of humans</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">i&#39;m going to make the argument that</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.719" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">probably this has very little to do with</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">genes</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">hybrid figure does right well a hybrid</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">vigor can work in terms of culture</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:50.799" style="s2">also yes and i would say many of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:53.520" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.799" end="01:09:54.400" style="s2">that we saw that showed the most extreme</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.520" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">potential</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.400" end="01:09:57.440" style="s2">were actually hybrids right and my sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">is that this</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.440" end="01:10:00.480" style="s2">cross-cultural so they had parents from</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:02.000" style="s2">different places</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.480" end="01:10:03.840" style="s2">from different places right and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.000" end="01:10:05.360" style="s2">sense was actually you got some of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.840" end="01:10:06.960" style="s2">wisdom from two different cultures</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.360" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">rather than getting two doses of wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.960" end="01:10:11.600" style="s2">from one culture or something</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.239" style="s2">yeah um but in this case you may even</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.600" end="01:10:15.360" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.239" end="01:10:16.239" style="s2">an economic phenomenon right so the</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.360" end="01:10:18.159" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.239" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">you&#39;re you know we are all in</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.159" end="01:10:21.280" style="s2">competition with other</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:22.960" style="s2">if assuming we are straight we are in</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.280" end="01:10:24.080" style="s2">competition with other members of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.960" end="01:10:27.520" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.080" end="01:10:29.280" style="s2">for mates and people mate with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.520" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">highest quality person that they can</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.280" end="01:10:34.880" style="s2">wrangle right superficially speaking</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:36.640" style="s2">the quality of the person you can</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.880" end="01:10:39.679" style="s2">wrangle may have a lot to do</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.640" end="01:10:40.719" style="s2">with what the incentives are in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.679" end="01:10:42.159" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.719" end="01:10:44.239" style="s2">from which you&#39;re wrangling and it may</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.159" end="01:10:46.480" style="s2">be that women are</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.239" end="01:10:48.159" style="s2">they get a better deal from males from a</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.480" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">different population</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.159" end="01:10:53.040" style="s2">um so in other words it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:54.320" style="s2">i mean i hate to talk in these terms i</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.040" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">don&#39;t really hate to talk in these terms</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.320" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t really think there&#39;s anything so</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:10:58.960" style="s2">terrible about being</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:00.800" style="s2">clear about this but i know that it will</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.960" end="01:11:02.560" style="s2">freak people out but</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.800" end="01:11:04.400" style="s2">the question is look you&#39;ve got some</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.560" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">goods in which market are they worth the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.400" end="01:11:07.600" style="s2">most</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:09.360" style="s2">and which market are they worth the most</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.600" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">in a currency that you value</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.360" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">right so it may be don&#39;t play around in</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:15.360" style="s2">markets that you don&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:16.640" style="s2">right why do that but you know so the</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.360" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">question like put yourself in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.640" end="01:11:20.560" style="s2">mindset of</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:22.080" style="s2">uh you know like a woman i think i can</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.560" end="01:11:23.199" style="s2">do that yeah it shouldn&#39;t be too too</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.080" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">much of a stretch for you</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.199" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">so put yourself in the mindset of a</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:30.159" style="s2">woman maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:32.800" style="s2">the value is in having a really devoted</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.159" end="01:11:33.679" style="s2">mate who&#39;s going to invest very heavily</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.800" end="01:11:36.719" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.679" end="01:11:38.400" style="s2">a mate who&#39;s you know uh only kind of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.719" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">paying attention and with which you</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.400" end="01:11:42.080" style="s2">have a lot of freedom right those are</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:43.040" style="s2">two different value sets and the point</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.080" end="01:11:45.360" style="s2">is well</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.040" end="01:11:46.800" style="s2">where would you find you know the</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.360" end="01:11:49.199" style="s2">highest quality mate</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.800" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">with what you bring to the to the table</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.199" end="01:11:52.320" style="s2">yeah uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">true it&#39;s a stretch to me to then jump</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:57.840" style="s2">to you&#39;re more likely to find that</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:12:00.159" style="s2">with via negative assorted mating for</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.840" end="01:12:02.400" style="s2">phenotypic characters</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.159" end="01:12:02.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:07.440" style="s2">unclear to me okay because the point is</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.320" end="01:12:09.040" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.440" end="01:12:11.440" style="s2">dealing with somebody on the other side</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.040" end="01:12:13.520" style="s2">of that equation who has the same puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.440" end="01:12:14.800" style="s2">as the inverse version right i just</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.520" end="01:12:15.440" style="s2">don&#39;t see any reason to think it would</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.800" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">track</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.440" end="01:12:18.880" style="s2">by things like ethnicity</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.360" end="01:12:25.679" style="s2">um track it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.400" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">necessarily the ethnicity it might be</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.679" end="01:12:34.159" style="s2">the um let&#39;s say that you are</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:37.199" style="s2">uh of the dominant population</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.159" end="01:12:40.080" style="s2">it might be that you will find</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.199" end="01:12:41.360" style="s2">a more devoted mate in a minority</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.080" end="01:12:45.280" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.360" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2">because the deal is better from the</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.280" end="01:12:47.199" style="s2">point of view of that individual of</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:50.000" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.199" end="01:12:51.520" style="s2">offspring so if this is true the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.000" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">prediction would be and i can get behind</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.520" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">this prediction i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">i think it is somewhat more likely to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.159" end="01:13:01.199" style="s2">true that</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:04.480" style="s2">um this would be true only</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.199" end="01:13:06.159" style="s2">for some groups and not for all</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.480" end="01:13:09.199" style="s2">like that you would you would not expect</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.159" end="01:13:12.320" style="s2">to find all groups negatively assertive</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">mating you know doing mate choice for</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.320" end="01:13:16.080" style="s2">uh people who looked very much not like</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">them and therefore were probably from</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:19.760" style="s2">somewhat different populations in recent</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:21.120" style="s2">history i&#39;m very skeptical that this is</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.760" end="01:13:23.120" style="s2">a general pattern</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.120" end="01:13:24.880" style="s2">but but might it be true for for some</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.120" end="01:13:26.239" style="s2">groups especially if you add</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.880" end="01:13:27.760" style="s2">you know it&#39;s going to sound post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.239" end="01:13:28.640" style="s2">to some but like if you add the power</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.760" end="01:13:30.480" style="s2">component if you</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.640" end="01:13:32.480" style="s2">add the understanding of actually who is</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.480" end="01:13:34.239" style="s2">wielding power and how is it that you</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.480" end="01:13:35.679" style="s2">try to get the best deal for yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.239" end="01:13:40.640" style="s2">an honorable way</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.679" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">yep humans have 23 chromosome pairs</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.640" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">all right this is true i believe the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:46.400" style="s2">militant moderate writes</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.159" style="s2">that chromosome pair number two has been</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.400" end="01:13:50.480" style="s2">found to be a combination of two ape</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.159" end="01:13:51.920" style="s2">pairs since other great apes have 24</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.480" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">pairs</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.920" end="01:13:55.360" style="s2">uh so i&#39;m just going to keep on stepping</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:13:58.400" style="s2">out to</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.360" end="01:13:59.040" style="s2">add editorial comment it&#39;s true that uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.400" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.040" end="01:14:03.840" style="s2">chimps have 24 pairs i have never seen</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">an analysis of which we think</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.840" end="01:14:06.960" style="s2">might have either been lost or fused in</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:08.640" style="s2">humans um</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.960" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">so that is that is a claim that is being</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.640" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">made here but the part that we are 100</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">sure of is</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:16.400" style="s2">humans of 23 at least chimps and i think</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">bonobos as well have 24 therefore</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.400" end="01:14:19.679" style="s2">something happened there</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.159" end="01:14:21.440" style="s2">do we know of other pairs of species and</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.679" end="01:14:24.080" style="s2">which chromosomes have</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.440" end="01:14:24.080" style="s2">fused</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:29.520" style="s2">um i believe that that is not so</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.159" style="s2">uncommon i think there&#39;s still a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.520" end="01:14:34.960" style="s2">mystery about how uh chromosome number</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.159" end="01:14:36.239" style="s2">changes yeah in animals and plants this</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.960" end="01:14:38.080" style="s2">is relatively common</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.239" end="01:14:39.600" style="s2">ploidy events well but so i was just</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.080" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">going to say you know ploidy events is</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.600" end="01:14:42.880" style="s2">different from</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.320" end="01:14:44.560" style="s2">a change in the haploid or the diploid</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.880" end="01:14:46.400" style="s2">number right so ploidy</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.560" end="01:14:48.239" style="s2">ploidy events to me tends to mean a</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.400" end="01:14:50.159" style="s2">doubling tripling octupling whatever if</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.239" end="01:14:51.360" style="s2">the entire genome so you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.159" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going on so much with</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.360" end="01:14:56.000" style="s2">frogs but they&#39;re crazy you know like</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:58.000" style="s2">congeners can be you know tetraploid</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.000" end="01:15:00.080" style="s2">versus</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.000" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">regular employed whatever that would be</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.080" end="01:15:04.239" style="s2">um but</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:05.920" style="s2">adding and dropping chromosomes i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.239" end="01:15:07.360" style="s2">even know exactly what we what we call</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.920" end="01:15:08.480" style="s2">that i guess it&#39;s still a ploidy event</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.360" end="01:15:11.040" style="s2">but it seems</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.480" end="01:15:11.040" style="s2">it seems</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.679" end="01:15:19.520" style="s2">you create a liberty to fuse something</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.800" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">so in other words initially what you</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.520" end="01:15:24.719" style="s2">have is just a simple doubling</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">but downstream of that event descendants</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.719" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">that have inherited the doubled number</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:31.360" style="s2">can alter something without interfering</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:34.000" style="s2">with the original</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.360" end="01:15:35.120" style="s2">genetic complement yeah but that so but</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.000" end="01:15:36.239" style="s2">just like i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.120" end="01:15:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a very different set of</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.239" end="01:15:40.239" style="s2">circumstances then for instance</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.800" end="01:15:42.320" style="s2">great apes at least some great apes have</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.239" end="01:15:44.239" style="s2">24 chromosomes we have 23.</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.320" end="01:15:46.400" style="s2">there was presumably no doubling event</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.239" end="01:15:48.640" style="s2">that then got us back to less than</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.400" end="01:15:49.760" style="s2">in this case even if it was 24 to 26 i</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.640" end="01:15:50.719" style="s2">think there&#39;s some great ape that has</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.760" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">maybe 26.</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.719" end="01:15:55.520" style="s2">i was talking about so what i said was</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">that in animals there&#39;s still a great</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.520" end="01:15:58.480" style="s2">deal of mystery about how these things</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:00.560" style="s2">work i believe</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.480" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">yes in plants there&#39;s much less mystery</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.560" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">because these ploidy events happen</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:08.080" style="s2">regularly okay and so um anyway there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:10.400" style="s2">just a simple mechanism plants are also</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.080" end="01:16:14.000" style="s2">less susceptible there&#39;s more room</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.400" end="01:16:15.440" style="s2">to take um a structure</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.000" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">and radically alter it without</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.440" end="01:16:18.800" style="s2">disrupting the fundamental nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:20.480" style="s2">plant itself</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.800" end="01:16:22.480" style="s2">their cells all of their cells tend to</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.480" end="01:16:24.239" style="s2">remain pluripotent of not totipotent</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.480" end="01:16:26.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t have segregated germ lines</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.239" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just you know all</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.320" end="01:16:28.719" style="s2">it&#39;s all different exactly it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:29.679" style="s2">different but it doesn&#39;t work that way</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.719" end="01:16:34.080" style="s2">with elephants</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.679" end="01:16:36.800" style="s2">not so much not so much yeah so um</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.080" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know a particular answer to this</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.800" end="01:16:40.239" style="s2">and i think one of the things that you</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:42.480" style="s2">can read from our answer is</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.239" end="01:16:43.920" style="s2">uh neither of us is up on the most</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.480" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">recent thinking on this</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.920" end="01:16:47.760" style="s2">but what we do believe is that there is</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">still a lot that is unknown and</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.760" end="01:16:49.520" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">probably some of what we think we</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.520" end="01:16:53.360" style="s2">currently know won&#39;t turn out to be true</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.199" end="01:16:59.840" style="s2">okay i&#39;m gonna try to i&#39;m gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.560" end="01:17:00.560" style="s2">through a few more of these since we</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.840" end="01:17:04.480" style="s2">just started</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.560" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">uh with this second one</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.480" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">is it possible that</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.520" end="01:17:15.199" style="s2">is it i&#39;m just going to read it exactly</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.000" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">as it&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.199" end="01:17:19.040" style="s2">is possible that you have left yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:22.159" style="s2">vulnerable after today&#39;s podcast if in</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.040" end="01:17:25.600" style="s2">the future you contract covid</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.159" end="01:17:27.840" style="s2">what oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.600" end="01:17:30.320" style="s2">that if we contract covid after talking</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.840" end="01:17:33.120" style="s2">about how to avoid covid that we will be</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.320" end="01:17:33.840" style="s2">mocked by our enemies or something oh</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.120" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.840" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s what it says i mean this</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:38.400" style="s2">has been this has been the case</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">from the beginning because we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.400" end="01:17:41.199" style="s2">about covet and our understanding of it</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:44.800" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.199" end="01:17:46.560" style="s2">um the</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.800" end="01:17:48.159" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re super careful but we might</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.560" end="01:17:49.760" style="s2">get it i</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.159" end="01:17:51.440" style="s2">worried that i had it at one point got</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.760" end="01:17:54.320" style="s2">tested didn&#39;t have it um</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.440" end="01:17:56.080" style="s2">clearly didn&#39;t have it based on uh what</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.320" end="01:17:58.239" style="s2">unfolded so this is always a risk and</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.080" end="01:17:59.760" style="s2">nobody you know as we if you go back to</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.239" end="01:18:00.960" style="s2">the early live streams you will hear us</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.760" end="01:18:03.440" style="s2">talking about the fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.960" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">that the only way is to be perfectly</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.440" end="01:18:06.719" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:08.560" style="s2">are unacceptable right right the level</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.719" end="01:18:10.000" style="s2">of isolation is too high so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.560" end="01:18:12.400" style="s2">accepting some level of risk and</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.000" end="01:18:14.960" style="s2">managing it is a</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.400" end="01:18:16.560" style="s2">question that involves you having to set</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.960" end="01:18:19.280" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.560" end="01:18:20.880" style="s2">you know a threshold but um yeah we</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.239" end="01:18:32.320" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty about</p>

<p begin="01:18:32.320" end="01:18:35.360" style="s2">definitely to be avoided</p>

<p begin="01:19:15.840" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">it was definitely dog whistly but i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.880" end="01:19:22.400" style="s2">seen a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:23.520" style="s2">because the nature of the question</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.400" end="01:19:26.719" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.520" end="01:19:29.840" style="s2">fusing the proud boys to</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.719" end="01:19:32.080" style="s2">white supremacists who were undefined</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.840" end="01:19:33.520" style="s2">there&#39;s an awful lot of shell game going</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.080" end="01:19:36.640" style="s2">along going</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.520" end="01:19:37.840" style="s2">in tandem with this so stand back and</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.640" end="01:19:39.760" style="s2">stand by</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.840" end="01:19:41.440" style="s2">could mean a lot of things the proud</p>

<p begin="01:19:41.440" end="01:19:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a frightening organization and</p>

<p begin="01:19:49.040" end="01:19:55.920" style="s2">clear but what what i&#39;ve seen people do</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.400" end="01:19:58.159" style="s2">is because he issued that in response to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.920" end="01:19:59.520" style="s2">a question in which white supremacists</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.159" end="01:20:02.560" style="s2">were called out but not</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.520" end="01:20:04.880" style="s2">named yeah it is unclear</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.560" end="01:20:07.280" style="s2">people have used that to portray him as</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.880" end="01:20:09.360" style="s2">telling white supremacists to stand</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.280" end="01:20:10.960" style="s2">back and stand by no but he seems to</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.360" end="01:20:13.840" style="s2">have been specifically responding</p>

<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:30.880" style="s2">unfortunately like they were useful and</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:33.120" style="s2">they&#39;re dead now like we just can&#39;t use</p>

<p begin="01:20:37.520" end="01:20:43.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t i i&#39;m still on the fence</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.280" end="01:20:45.760" style="s2">but i don&#39;t think so if i mean if i had</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.280" end="01:20:47.520" style="s2">to decide if i had to declare right now</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.760" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">is proud boys a white supremacist</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.520" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">organization i would say i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:53.520" style="s2">don&#39;t think so yeah from what i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:54.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know right so but if you had if</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:56.239" style="s2">you&#39;re like okay but you you</p>

<p begin="01:20:56.239" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">you have to decide yes yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.920" end="01:21:02.960" style="s2">i would say undoubtedly or almost</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:05.280" style="s2">undoubtedly there are white supremacists</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.960" end="01:21:07.120" style="s2">in the proud boys what that has to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.280" end="01:21:08.400" style="s2">with what the proud boys are about</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.120" end="01:21:10.239" style="s2">i don&#39;t know and i also don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.400" end="01:21:11.679" style="s2">responsibility for figuring it out right</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.239" end="01:21:14.960" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.679" end="01:21:17.679" style="s2">the hubbub around this answer has to do</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.960" end="01:21:18.320" style="s2">with you know even having asked ask the</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.679" end="01:21:21.679" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.320" end="01:21:23.040" style="s2">in this form makes it difficult to know</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.679" end="01:21:25.040" style="s2">what the answer would mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.040" end="01:21:26.400" style="s2">i think it was an irresponsible question</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.040" end="01:21:27.280" style="s2">if you want to ask about white</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.400" end="01:21:29.120" style="s2">supremacists</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.280" end="01:21:31.360" style="s2">fine if you want to ask about proud boys</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.120" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">fine but well i think if if memory</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.360" end="01:21:33.840" style="s2">serves i think he</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.320" end="01:21:35.679" style="s2">i think chris wallace did ask about</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.840" end="01:21:36.880" style="s2">white supremacists and</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.679" end="01:21:38.480" style="s2">gosh i hope i&#39;m not getting this wrong</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.880" end="01:21:39.760" style="s2">but i think trump said but who like who</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.480" end="01:21:42.719" style="s2">are we talking about or</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.760" end="01:21:44.320" style="s2">some something to that effect and or he</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.719" end="01:21:46.480" style="s2">said well of course i denounce</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.320" end="01:21:48.239" style="s2">but like which one&#39;s white supremacist</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.480" end="01:21:51.199" style="s2">but like who specifically</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.239" end="01:21:53.440" style="s2">are we talking about and it&#39;s that where</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.199" end="01:21:55.600" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.440" end="01:21:57.040" style="s2">he&#39;s easily described he&#39;s reliably</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.600" end="01:22:00.000" style="s2">described by everyone</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.040" end="01:22:00.960" style="s2">on the left who wants to see it as he is</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.000" end="01:22:03.679" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.960" end="01:22:04.719" style="s2">advocating for white supremacism and</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.679" end="01:22:06.880" style="s2">racism</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.719" end="01:22:08.960" style="s2">but we also see exactly those same</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.880" end="01:22:12.560" style="s2">people those exact same institutions</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.960" end="01:22:14.639" style="s2">saying that his official memorandum on</p>

<p begin="01:22:18.320" end="01:22:24.400" style="s2">supremacy and racism and that is not</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:26.480" style="s2">like that we can be 100 clear about so</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.400" end="01:22:28.000" style="s2">you know does he does he play footsie</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.480" end="01:22:30.480" style="s2">with uh some</p>

<p begin="01:22:33.360" end="01:22:37.040" style="s2">right yeah not because i voted for the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.440" end="01:22:39.040" style="s2">guy or i&#39;m going to vote for the guy</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.040" end="01:22:40.320" style="s2">or i like him but just like we deserve</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.040" end="01:22:42.239" style="s2">better as americans</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.320" end="01:22:43.840" style="s2">to not have a president who&#39;s willing to</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.239" end="01:22:47.280" style="s2">do that but</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.840" end="01:22:50.880" style="s2">is he um potentially</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.280" end="01:22:53.199" style="s2">trying to do right by organizations that</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.880" end="01:22:54.080" style="s2">are you know questionable in their</p>

<p begin="01:22:58.560" end="01:23:01.920" style="s2">if it is from pax lander maybe he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.639" end="01:23:03.520" style="s2">trying to be careful like</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.920" end="01:23:05.120" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t seem like the guy that</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.520" end="01:23:07.199" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen but um</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.120" end="01:23:08.159" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t it be great if he was just</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.199" end="01:23:11.199" style="s2">trying not</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.159" end="01:23:13.600" style="s2">to sign on with a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.199" end="01:23:15.760" style="s2">across-the-board claim that anyone who</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.600" end="01:23:17.440" style="s2">disagrees with woke culture for instance</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.760" end="01:23:19.040" style="s2">is interested in white supremacy because</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.440" end="01:23:20.000" style="s2">that certainly isn&#39;t true yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.040" end="01:23:22.159" style="s2">isn&#39;t true but</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:23.199" style="s2">at some level i i just don&#39;t like this</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.159" end="01:23:25.199" style="s2">landscape at all</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.199" end="01:23:26.639" style="s2">right yeah we are somehow getting</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.199" end="01:23:28.639" style="s2">involved in</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.639" end="01:23:30.480" style="s2">you know us having to figure out what</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.480" end="01:23:39.199" style="s2">at some level i would say look what i</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.560" end="01:23:42.239" style="s2">want is for the president to say</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.199" end="01:23:42.800" style="s2">um you know we all need to rise above</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.239" end="01:23:44.800" style="s2">this that</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.800" end="01:23:46.159" style="s2">our interest as americans involves</p>

<p begin="01:23:46.159" end="01:23:51.520" style="s2">uh as you know important</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.440" end="01:23:53.280" style="s2">and yeah that any organization that</p>

<p begin="01:23:53.280" end="01:23:56.560" style="s2">yeah and you know we didn&#39;t get that out</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">of him</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.560" end="01:23:59.920" style="s2">um yep so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.000" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">it is what it is i suppose</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.440" end="01:24:11.199" style="s2">timeline integrated sensory experience</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:12.719" style="s2">oral language pictographics phonics</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.199" end="01:24:15.520" style="s2">printing press which comes with</p>

<p begin="01:24:22.000" end="01:24:26.000" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a lot in that and um</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.639" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.000" end="01:24:30.159" style="s2">but it&#39;s a it&#39;s a worthy timeline to</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:32.159" style="s2">have described</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.159" end="01:24:34.320" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering why integrated sensory</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.159" end="01:24:36.000" style="s2">experiences before oral language i</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.320" end="01:24:37.120" style="s2">wonder if i&#39;d maybe a misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.000" end="01:24:39.280" style="s2">what that means</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.120" end="01:24:40.239" style="s2">yeah i integrated sensory experience</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.280" end="01:24:43.199" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.239" end="01:24:44.080" style="s2">to me looks like what all social</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.199" end="01:24:47.040" style="s2">organisms</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.080" end="01:24:48.080" style="s2">have um i don&#39;t i mean maybe it can mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.040" end="01:24:51.440" style="s2">a lot of different things and</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.080" end="01:24:54.159" style="s2">oh it&#39;s integrated within an individual</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.440" end="01:24:55.840" style="s2">well no social organisms are integrating</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.159" end="01:24:56.719" style="s2">their sensory experience with other</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.840" end="01:24:58.239" style="s2">individuals you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.719" end="01:24:59.920" style="s2">in order to have something like theory</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.239" end="01:25:03.280" style="s2">of mind and</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.920" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">um just being social is you are you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.280" end="01:25:06.639" style="s2">sharing sensory experience</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.000" end="01:25:12.480" style="s2">um i&#39;m just not not buying that we know</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.280" end="01:25:15.120" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.480" end="01:25:16.960" style="s2">don&#39;t be we know what that the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.120" end="01:25:18.800" style="s2">an animal is social</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.960" end="01:25:20.560" style="s2">means that it is sharing sensory</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.800" end="01:25:22.960" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.560" end="01:25:24.400" style="s2">so because social doesn&#39;t social doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.960" end="01:25:27.520" style="s2">inherently mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.400" end="01:25:28.800" style="s2">that you have theory of mind it just</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.520" end="01:25:30.400" style="s2">means that you&#39;re interacting with other</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.800" end="01:25:31.920" style="s2">members of your species</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.400" end="01:25:33.040" style="s2">yeah so if you&#39;re interacting with other</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.920" end="01:25:34.480" style="s2">members of your species how are you</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.040" end="01:25:39.040" style="s2">doing except with your senses</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.480" end="01:25:40.719" style="s2">well okay but um</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.040" end="01:25:42.400" style="s2">integrated sensory experience i mean</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.719" end="01:25:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not a ter i think it needs</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.400" end="01:25:45.440" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.440" end="01:25:46.480" style="s2">we either need to define it and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.440" end="01:25:48.880" style="s2">a term that we&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.480" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">seen before integrating sensory</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.880" end="01:25:51.199" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:52.400" style="s2">we need to define it first i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.199" end="01:25:53.679" style="s2">this is an interesting game to play</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.400" end="01:25:56.159" style="s2">without defining the term</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.679" end="01:25:56.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s not a term that exists in our</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.159" end="01:25:58.400" style="s2">landscape</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.880" end="01:25:59.679" style="s2">so i&#39;m sure there&#39;s something real there</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.400" end="01:26:00.480" style="s2">so i took it as one thing you took it to</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.679" end="01:26:01.679" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.480" end="01:26:03.760" style="s2">could be the person writing the question</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.679" end="01:26:08.480" style="s2">took it as something else entirely</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.760" end="01:26:11.760" style="s2">but regardless you have some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.480" end="01:26:14.080" style="s2">shared sensory experience and then oral</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.760" end="01:26:17.360" style="s2">language than pictographics</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.080" end="01:26:19.360" style="s2">meaning like cave drawings right um</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.360" end="01:26:21.360" style="s2">phonics what is what is what is i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.360" end="01:26:23.360" style="s2">sure what phonics is then</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.360" end="01:26:24.719" style="s2">printing press which has gatekeepers</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.360" end="01:26:26.159" style="s2">social media in which everyone can</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.719" end="01:26:27.520" style="s2">publish and then smartphones when</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.159" end="01:26:28.480" style="s2">everyone can publish videos so at one</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.520" end="01:26:32.000" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.480" end="01:26:36.080" style="s2">this strikes me as alluding to um</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.000" end="01:26:38.800" style="s2">this analysis by walter ong in a book um</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.080" end="01:26:40.639" style="s2">boy 50s 60s 70s i can&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.800" end="01:26:44.159" style="s2">called orality and literacy</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.639" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">in which he is um arguing</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.159" end="01:26:48.400" style="s2">that um oral cultures cultures without a</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:49.679" style="s2">written language</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.400" end="01:26:51.520" style="s2">and you know he at that point called</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.679" end="01:26:52.960" style="s2">them pre-literate and increasingly</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.520" end="01:26:53.600" style="s2">anthropologists would like us to call</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.960" end="01:26:55.440" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.600" end="01:26:56.960" style="s2">non-literate because they aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.440" end="01:26:58.400" style="s2">inherently going to literacy nor</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.960" end="01:27:01.679" style="s2">aspiring to literacy</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.400" end="01:27:03.360" style="s2">um but sort of you know oral oral</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.679" end="01:27:04.800" style="s2">exclusive cultures have very different</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.360" end="01:27:05.280" style="s2">ways of being and understanding the</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.800" end="01:27:08.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.280" end="01:27:10.800" style="s2">than literary cultures do and walter ong</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.880" end="01:27:12.960" style="s2">began to ask whether or not we might</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.800" end="01:27:14.719" style="s2">have a returned oral ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.960" end="01:27:16.880" style="s2">even back in the gosh i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.719" end="01:27:19.199" style="s2">if it was 50 60 70s</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.880" end="01:27:20.320" style="s2">but specifically with the advent of</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.199" end="01:27:22.560" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.320" end="01:27:25.600" style="s2">people began saying okay actually this</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.560" end="01:27:27.440" style="s2">begins to look like even though it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.600" end="01:27:29.520" style="s2">text that the ways that we are</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.440" end="01:27:31.120" style="s2">communicating now are much more like</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.520" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">oral societies did</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.120" end="01:27:35.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s confusing to us because we have</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.520" end="01:27:37.360" style="s2">an entire societal framework based on</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.679" end="01:27:39.280" style="s2">a literate understanding of you know a</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.360" end="01:27:41.440" style="s2">literate society understanding</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.280" end="01:27:42.880" style="s2">uh and i i won&#39;t say much more than that</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.440" end="01:27:44.080" style="s2">right now but we might come back to it</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.880" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.080" end="01:27:51.679" style="s2">actually pretty fascinating</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:54.480" style="s2">done yep okay a company called elysium</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.679" end="01:27:56.080" style="s2">created by biophds sells nad plus</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.480" end="01:27:56.639" style="s2">supplements that promote a healthy aging</p>

<p begin="01:28:00.000" end="01:28:05.760" style="s2">exact this question before yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.120" end="01:28:07.440" style="s2">um you know look if you have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.760" end="01:28:08.560" style="s2">deficiency</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.440" end="01:28:09.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to be said for a</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.560" end="01:28:11.679" style="s2">supplement if you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.600" end="01:28:12.400" style="s2">deficiency it&#39;s very hard to enhance the</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.679" end="01:28:15.760" style="s2">functioning</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.400" end="01:28:19.440" style="s2">of the organism beyond what</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.760" end="01:28:20.480" style="s2">selection does there are places this</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.440" end="01:28:21.440" style="s2">might not be</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.480" end="01:28:23.520" style="s2">right but they&#39;re going to be the</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.440" end="01:28:24.320" style="s2">exception i can&#39;t speak to it directly</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.520" end="01:28:26.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.320" end="01:28:29.360" style="s2">i&#39;m skeptical yeah and the idea that</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.560" end="01:28:30.960" style="s2">every human</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.360" end="01:28:32.480" style="s2">that every human has a deficiency that</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.960" end="01:28:34.880" style="s2">could be fixed by a supplement</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.480" end="01:28:36.480" style="s2">is suggests a pretty radical</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.880" end="01:28:38.080" style="s2">misunderstanding of evolution because if</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.480" end="01:28:39.440" style="s2">it could be fixed that way why didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.080" end="01:28:41.440" style="s2">selection fix it</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.440" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">yeah i mean so unless it&#39;s a novelty</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.440" end="01:28:45.920" style="s2">issue like vitamin d</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:48.159" style="s2">either a novelty issue or a pathology</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.920" end="01:28:49.920" style="s2">of some sort largely you know broadly</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.159" end="01:28:51.840" style="s2">speaking that affects some</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.920" end="01:28:54.080" style="s2">some number of people but not but not</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.840" end="01:28:59.360" style="s2">all people</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.080" end="01:28:59.360" style="s2">okay let&#39;s do um two</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.320" end="01:29:05.280" style="s2">more um</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.000" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">what do you believe evolution is is it a</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.480" end="01:29:11.520" style="s2">force of nature a simple algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:13.040" style="s2">encoded in the data of life or perhaps a</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.520" end="01:29:14.800" style="s2">mathematical function like a chaotic</p>

<p begin="01:29:16.080" end="01:29:24.320" style="s2">and this is from chop resident</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.600" end="01:29:24.320" style="s2">chop resident the chop house</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.199" end="01:29:29.920" style="s2">the answer to that is that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.320" end="01:29:32.800" style="s2">about this a little bit before</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.920" end="01:29:34.719" style="s2">there are four parameters that cause a</p>

<p begin="01:29:44.639" end="01:29:51.679" style="s2">be self-similar the tendency</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.000" end="01:29:53.120" style="s2">to um stick around once created and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.679" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">tendency to accumulate</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.120" end="01:29:58.400" style="s2">limited materials that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:29:59.760" style="s2">selection and it creates every pattern</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.400" end="01:30:02.800" style="s2">that is non-biotic</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.760" end="01:30:04.639" style="s2">you get into a biotic milieu you add one</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.800" end="01:30:07.199" style="s2">thing to it which is heredity</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.639" end="01:30:08.800" style="s2">then you get adaptation and when you we</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.199" end="01:30:11.840" style="s2">say evolution typically we mean</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.800" end="01:30:14.880" style="s2">adaptation and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.840" end="01:30:18.560" style="s2">answer is this is an automatic</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.880" end="01:30:21.760" style="s2">uh it is in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.560" end="01:30:25.520" style="s2">a nearly tautological consequence</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.760" end="01:30:27.760" style="s2">of preconditions that will result in</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.520" end="01:30:28.800" style="s2">patterns becoming more common and then</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.760" end="01:30:30.719" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.800" end="01:30:32.840" style="s2">features that cause increases in</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.719" end="01:30:34.000" style="s2">commonality accumulating through</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.840" end="01:30:36.800" style="s2">adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.000" end="01:30:38.080" style="s2">excellent um would you accept the three</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.800" end="01:30:41.199" style="s2">word definition</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.080" end="01:30:43.120" style="s2">descent with modification well if we</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.199" end="01:30:45.440" style="s2">you know if we&#39;re being literal about</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.120" end="01:30:47.679" style="s2">what we think the question asker</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.440" end="01:30:49.280" style="s2">means what do you believe evolution is</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.679" end="01:30:50.400" style="s2">right i understand what they&#39;ve asked</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.280" end="01:30:53.679" style="s2">but the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.400" end="01:30:56.400" style="s2">evolution which uh does not</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.679" end="01:30:56.960" style="s2">involve anything interesting as its</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.400" end="01:31:00.000" style="s2">product</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.960" end="01:31:01.360" style="s2">is simply uh genetic change within a</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.000" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.360" end="01:31:06.000" style="s2">over time but can&#39;t that be</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:07.679" style="s2">crunched down to descent with</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.000" end="01:31:10.960" style="s2">modification that can</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.679" end="01:31:12.560" style="s2">but if you think that um that is</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.960" end="01:31:14.000" style="s2">tantamount to</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.560" end="01:31:15.679" style="s2">adaptation which is what people</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.000" end="01:31:16.000" style="s2">typically mean when they say evolution</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.679" end="01:31:18.239" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.000" end="01:31:19.199" style="s2">then it&#39;s insufficient right it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.239" end="01:31:21.199" style="s2">insufficient</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.199" end="01:31:23.360" style="s2">um but evolution to something</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.199" end="01:31:23.920" style="s2">modification change over time never good</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.360" end="01:31:25.360" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.920" end="01:31:27.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing that people</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.360" end="01:31:28.719" style="s2">think they think and in fact i was</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.600" end="01:31:30.800" style="s2">listening to an otherwise really good</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.719" end="01:31:32.239" style="s2">podcast this morning in which the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.800" end="01:31:34.000" style="s2">author of this book who knew a lot about</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.239" end="01:31:35.120" style="s2">what he was talking about but as usual</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.000" end="01:31:36.800" style="s2">didn&#39;t really know anything about</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.120" end="01:31:38.400" style="s2">evolution said you know that evolution</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.800" end="01:31:38.719" style="s2">you know change that&#39;s what evolution is</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.400" end="01:31:40.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.719" end="01:31:43.440" style="s2">no rocks change over time and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.480" end="01:31:46.400" style="s2">evolve descent with modification</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.440" end="01:31:46.400" style="s2">is the shortest</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.480" end="01:31:50.880" style="s2">definition that actually seems inclusive</p>
<p begin="01:31:51.520" end="01:31:55.840" style="s2">we have an insect that has invaded the</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.360" end="01:32:00.639" style="s2">house and our epic tabby is</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.840" end="01:32:03.280" style="s2">interested in eating it</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.639" end="01:32:04.159" style="s2">okay one more question is unity 2020</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.280" end="01:32:06.000" style="s2">finished</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.159" end="01:32:07.360" style="s2">going forward how about american unity</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.000" end="01:32:09.760" style="s2">name change do either of you know where</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.360" end="01:32:11.360" style="s2">your vote will go at this point</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.760" end="01:32:12.800" style="s2">that was three questions yeah i&#39;ll fight</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.360" end="01:32:15.600" style="s2">you naked</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.800" end="01:32:15.600" style="s2">there&#39;s three questions</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.560" end="01:32:19.600" style="s2">it says that okay no that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.040" end="01:32:23.199" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:32:19.600" end="01:32:23.760" style="s2">oh that&#39;s i thought that threw me all</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.199" end="01:32:26.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.760" end="01:32:28.159" style="s2">so uh is unity 2020. exactly what this</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.400" end="01:32:32.159" style="s2">person has been hoping for</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.159" end="01:32:35.199" style="s2">unity 2020 is um</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.159" end="01:32:38.639" style="s2">suspended it could be unsuspended</p>
<p begin="01:32:35.199" end="01:32:40.800" style="s2">if crazy events caused it to be viable</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.639" end="01:32:43.920" style="s2">again and we have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.800" end="01:32:45.760" style="s2">a crazy event that has not yet created</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.920" end="01:32:47.520" style="s2">the opportunity for unity 2020 but</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.760" end="01:32:48.000" style="s2">depending upon how things unfold it</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.520" end="01:32:51.679" style="s2">could</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.000" end="01:32:53.120" style="s2">so um no it&#39;s not finished unity itself</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.679" end="01:32:54.639" style="s2">the unity movement is certainly not</p>
<p begin="01:32:53.120" end="01:32:58.000" style="s2">finished</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.639" end="01:32:58.000" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.400" end="01:33:01.600" style="s2">you know there is a question i want to</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.679" end="01:33:05.520" style="s2">say anything about that about unity</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.600" end="01:33:08.800" style="s2">unity not unity 2020 going forward</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.520" end="01:33:11.600" style="s2">um yes well i can say that we are taking</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.800" end="01:33:13.600" style="s2">steps to build an organization um we</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.600" end="01:33:17.280" style="s2">have so far done everything</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.600" end="01:33:19.040" style="s2">without money and that has been</p>
<p begin="01:33:17.280" end="01:33:21.360" style="s2">good in one way but it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.040" end="01:33:23.920" style="s2">limiting in another way so we are</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.360" end="01:33:25.360" style="s2">realizing that with more time we will</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.920" end="01:33:28.320" style="s2">need to build an entity</p>
<p begin="01:33:25.360" end="01:33:29.280" style="s2">that is capable of taking donations and</p>
<p begin="01:33:28.320" end="01:33:31.040" style="s2">using them</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.280" end="01:33:32.320" style="s2">well so anyway we&#39;re in the process of</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.040" end="01:33:35.679" style="s2">building that</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.320" end="01:33:37.440" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s no question that</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.679" end="01:33:39.120" style="s2">there needs to be a unity movement and</p>
<p begin="01:33:37.440" end="01:33:41.840" style="s2">it needs to</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.120" end="01:33:43.760" style="s2">bring to an end this cycle of</p>
<p begin="01:33:41.840" end="01:33:45.199" style="s2">polarization that&#39;s putting the republic</p>
<p begin="01:33:43.760" end="01:33:47.280" style="s2">in so much jeopardy so</p>
<p begin="01:33:45.199" end="01:33:48.960" style="s2">whether there&#39;s an opportunity in 2020</p>
<p begin="01:33:47.280" end="01:33:52.239" style="s2">we don&#39;t know but going forward</p>
<p begin="01:33:48.960" end="01:33:54.880" style="s2">there better be because we need it</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.239" end="01:33:56.080" style="s2">that&#39;s right all right well i think</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.880" end="01:34:00.560" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached the end</p>
