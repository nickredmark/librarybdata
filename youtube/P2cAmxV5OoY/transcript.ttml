<p begin="00:00:03.580" end="00:00:06.690" style="s2">Then the memes came and then a day later</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.800" end="00:00:10.120" style="s2">kind of took a joyless turn.</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.120" end="00:00:11.780" style="s2">Yeah yesterday and today right now</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.120" end="00:00:15.870" style="s2">Yeah, well it&#39;s amazing well, so here&#39;s the strange thing hey, so</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.510" end="00:00:21.569" style="s2">I kind of played let&#39;s say knight on white horse and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.760" end="00:00:25.600" style="s2">so the Guardian yesterday published a</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.440" end="00:00:29.480" style="s2">Astoundingly reprehensible article -</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.480" end="00:00:30.300" style="s2">About your book?</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.300" end="00:00:35.260" style="s2">No, about the Channel 4 interview. No, they&#39;ve done some nice interviews about my book</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">so they&#39;ve been kind of all over the place with me you know but</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.100" end="00:00:41.820" style="s2">the Channel 4 people claim that</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.100" end="00:00:45.620" style="s2">Kathy has been targeted with threats, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.180" end="00:00:52.620" style="s2">A torrent of online abuse by internet trolls, it&#39;s like 50,000 trolls. You know that&#39;s a lot of trolls</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:55.820" style="s2">You might start thinking maybe they&#39;re not all trolls, but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.980" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">overwhelmed by misogynistic abuse and</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.700" end="00:01:06.980" style="s2">threats and that they had called in a security specialist to assess the level of threat and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.270" end="00:01:12.839" style="s2">It was the beginning of the attempt to twist the story around so that the story became:</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:16.210" style="s2">Kathy Newman -</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.210" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">poor embattled Channel 4 newscaster was merely trying to do her job even though she might have been a bit provocative</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.460" end="00:01:27.920" style="s2">interviewed alt-right hero Dr. Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.480" end="00:01:32.940" style="s2">in an honest manner to to expose his agenda,</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.480" end="00:01:36.600" style="s2">posted the results to YouTube and was immediately</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.840" end="00:01:39.140" style="s2">mobbed by his army of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.760" end="00:01:44.200" style="s2">Internet trolls right so she went from - so, my sense is she went from</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.520" end="00:01:52.140" style="s2">journalist playing a variety of complicated games to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.620" end="00:01:59.300" style="s2">target of criticism online to</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.540" end="00:02:01.740" style="s2">heroine</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.740" end="00:02:04.220" style="s2">embattled heroine in the panoply of</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.060" end="00:02:09.680" style="s2">martyrs to whom similar things have happened in the past and what&#39;s terrible about it -</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.780" end="00:02:13.300" style="s2">So, and I inadvertently I would say</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.400" end="00:02:15.660" style="s2">contributed to that because</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:21.659" style="s2">when the Guardian story came out I read it and the story purported to be about the threats that she had received</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.060" end="00:02:28.259" style="s2">but really this story because the story opened with the description of me and the description was let&#39;s call it far from flattery</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.320" end="00:02:34.940" style="s2">you know, it was the same old thing:  Dr. Peterson, he&#39;s a provocateur. He has an army of trolls if anybody ever</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.740" end="00:02:39.540" style="s2">dares to challenge him, let&#39;s say, I know all they&#39;re doing is honestly</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.600" end="00:02:44.600" style="s2">charging the trolls come out and then they have to fear for their lives, and that was that was the story</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.600" end="00:02:48.540" style="s2">(that&#39;s the narrative now) the threat that threats were just the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.400" end="00:02:54.760" style="s2">prerequisite for the story, and then yeah like a dozen UK news</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.560" end="00:03:01.240" style="s2">media sources that the newspapers in particular have picked us this up some</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:06.300" style="s2">even more critical of me than that some in a slightly more balanced fashion</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.580" end="00:03:11.740" style="s2">but and see when the Guardian story broke I tweeted something</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.420" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">I said look if you&#39;re-- I&#39;ve looked at the tweet too are they?</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.320" end="00:03:21.299" style="s2">YouTube comments and most of the more merely criticism, but if you&#39;re threatening her</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.910" end="00:03:23.910" style="s2">well, stop, you know, because</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.250" end="00:03:27.360" style="s2">we had an exchange of words, which is what we&#39;re supposed to do.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.390" end="00:03:32.339" style="s2">I think this message to your followers was one of the most liked tweet you ever put out. - Yeah,</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.340" end="00:03:34.060" style="s2">but here&#39;s the terrible thing about it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.060" end="00:03:40.620" style="s2">You know, what happened was that the fact that I tweeted that was instantly used as</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.880" end="00:03:45.140" style="s2">validation for the claim that there were threats and that was just yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.150" end="00:03:48.420" style="s2">That&#39;s what happened and see it&#39;s weird because when I wrote that I thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.000" end="00:03:51.000" style="s2">Was part of me that thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.360" end="00:03:56.420" style="s2">that thought that that might happen there was a little warning bell that went off that said look you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.800" end="00:04:01.240" style="s2">There&#39;s no evidence that these threats are credible, and if you respond by</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.580" end="00:04:05.560" style="s2">asking people to back off</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.560" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">You&#39;re also implying that there are people who who should back off that this is real, and I thought no</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.970" end="00:04:13.970" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna do it anyways because</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.020" end="00:04:15.790" style="s2">She has been targeted</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.790" end="00:04:21.659" style="s2">She has been subject to a very large number of very vitriolic comments</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">And maybe that&#39;s enough and so you know it&#39;s okay to come out say that&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.410" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">But the thing it wasn&#39;t okay because as soon as I did it</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.920" end="00:04:31.630" style="s2">Then the fact that I did it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.630" end="00:04:37.120" style="s2">Used as proof that all of these claims were valid and now that just floored me like I was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.520" end="00:04:43.340" style="s2">Distraught, I think is the right word about that this morning because I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t see that coming</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.570" end="00:04:48.839" style="s2">&gt;Then were there threats against her have you seen them &gt;define threat fresh suffice</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:51.880" style="s2">There&#39;s no threats that were sufficient to get the police involved</p>
