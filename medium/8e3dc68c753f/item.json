As biological organisms and natural participants in nature’s scale-linking processes, all human beings can, and do, affect the health of individuals, communities, ecosystems and the planet as a whole. We are only slowly waking up to the cumulative, time-delayed, and spatially removed effects human actions are having on the planet’s health. Since planetary and human health are fundamentally linked, preventing environmental damage and maintaining healthy ecosystems is the most effective long-term strategy to promote health in humans. In 1992, the ‘Commission on Health and Environment’ created by the World Health Organization (WHO) published a report entitled Our planet, our health. Its opening statement reads:",

Over 1000 million people lack the income or land to meet such basic needs. Hundreds of millions suffer from undernutrition. It is a requirement of health that global cycles and systems on which all life depends are sustained. Population growth and the way resources are exploited and wastes generated threaten the environmental base on which health and survival depend and transmit the growing costs to future generations. The toll they extract on human health and natural resources and systems could be enormously reduced by better environmental management.”— WHO Commission on Health and Environment (1992, pp.xiii-xiv).",
