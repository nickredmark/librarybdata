For example: in the education domain once a group of practitioners believes they have figured out how to build a GameB Charter School that is generalizable they could create and keep updated an X-In-The-Box: “How to Create and Operate a GameB Charter School” that could be used by any collaborating group of parents to launch their own Charter School. Creators of an X-In-A-Box should assume that most people will need and want to make changes and variations for their own locations, circumstances, and values. So don’t make one too prescriptive and dogmatic! We will need a set of tools for creating and finding X-In-A-Boxs. I’m interested in working on those tools, anybody else want to help out?",

Or can we craft an entirely new kind of organizing that doesn’t require a legal entity? Perhaps relationships mediated by smart contract on a blockchain platform. I would expect entity type should be an area of active experimentation and invention. While a dry and specialist domain, making good choices here will likely be quite important to success or failure of a ProtoB. And the learnings from early ProtoBs need to be shared so as to reduce the activation energy for later ProtoBs via creation of Entity Structure X-In-the-Boxes.",

There is a huge range of possibilities ranging from anarchist style “consensus decision making only” to a pretty rigid command and control system similar to a for profit corporation. I doubt whether either extreme will be appropriate for a ProtoB and again, like entity form, I would hope to see a lot of experimentation with governance systems in early ProtoBs. This will also be a domain where horizontal sharing of results between ProtoBs and with the PreB world will be very valuable. A useful set of meta ideas about governance can be found in Forrest Landry’s paper On the Nature of Human Assembly. I like how Forrest keeps democracy foundational but admits that democracy (ie voting on stuff) can be very divisive and hence should be used rarely but powerfully. We should feel free to think outside the box of the conventional. We are inventing a new social operating system after all! Here is a link to an example of a rather non-traditional governance model that we created for our local Staunton Makerspace using A Council of Guilds approach that passed muster with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the IRS. Dan Funk and Meghan Williamson were the principal authors. Here we used a GameA formal structure — a not-for-profit corporation, in an innovative GameBish way. I have lots of ideas about governance of ProtoBs but this document is already too long! Maybe a future essay on just that topic…..",

At the highest level of scope and intensity, a ProtoB might be in the form of an “intentional community” where members are co-resident on a piece of land and live together 7x24 in fully shared living and working. On the other end of the spectrum a ProtoB might be launched where people continue to live where they have been living and mostly keep their GameA jobs, but with a substantial number of shared events and services such as a school for the children, community daycare for children and elders, common dinners and parties, and a partial pooling of financial interests. In between, we might see a ProtoB that consists of multiple independent resident-managed co-housing venues within reasonably close physical proximity with a number of ProtoB business ventures that a growing proportion of the ProtoB members will work at. And those examples just scratch the surface of possible ways to navigate the scope and intensity question. And there is no reason that scope and intensity can’t change over time. Maybe a ProtoB starts loosely coupled and becomes more fully coupled as experience and trust grows. Or perhaps a fully coupled “intentional community” ProtoB decides to allow less fully coupled members to join either as individuals or as non-contiguous co-housing units. Experiment!

Like smartphones, or ad-supported media, or GMO foods, or airline travel, or genetically selective IVR, many others to ponder. The Amish and Mennonites have been doing this for a long time, so there is probably a lot to learn from them and their processes. They do it at a local level. Like the Amish and Mennonites, different ProtoBs can and often should come to different conclusions, though they should also share their thinking with each other which may tend towards rough convergence over time. Here is a link to how the Amish manage technology — well worth a read.",

          "text": "Food is an area that a ProtoB can do better than an individual or family PreB. And there are many ways that a ProtoB could address food. Cooking and eating in common may well be a key part. The scale of a ProtoB and opportunities for a division of labor may also make it easier to establish relationships with local Community Supported Agriculture efforts or to contract directly with local agricultural producers to provide f good, ethical, sustainable food, at a reasonable price. Some ProtoBs may choose to do some agriculture themselves. A word of warning though from a farmer and person who has studied local agriculture: it’s fucking hard and unless one is a near-genius it doesn’t pay well! While naively one might think “growing our own food would be great’,’ my advice would be that in the beginning, only a minority of ProtoBs ought to decide to produce most of their food themselves, and only those with experienced farmers on board should do so. Fortunately, in most parts of the country there is a rapidly growing ethical local agricultural movement and serving as a customer for them may be a more realistic way to proceed, especially early on. Over time, where there is real expertise and interest, a ProtoB could migrate to self-sourcing a more and more of its food.",

A better form of education and child-raising, in general, may well be one of the biggest differentiators that will attract people to a ProtoB. Working-class people have mainly bad schools available to them, while the middle class and above schools are becoming overheated furnaces of anxiety and overworked and over-managed children. We can do better! However, like agriculture, education is hard to do well, and the naive thought that “I was educated, therefore I’m an authority on it” is mostly false. There is a lot of good cognitive science on what works in learning and unfortunately, our school systems have been extremely slow to adopt them. A ProtoB ought to have an “education group” which explores the research and what has worked (or not) elsewhere to craft and tune the educational offerings in that ProtoB. Education is likely to be an area where X-In-The-Box or Part learnings will be very important.",

The scale of the larger ProtoBs should allow a more humane, intelligent, and cost-effective approach to health and health care. First around more healthy lifestyles and non-pharmaceutical non-industrial medicine interventions. And when access to external healthcare is needed a ProtoB (or perhaps an alliance of ProtoBs) can likely buy such access at a much lower rate as a pooled risk entity that self insures for all but the most catastrophic of needs. Health care is now 19% of GDP. Smart healthy living, non-professional community-based care, and self-insurance with only catastrophic insurance coverage could easily reduce that by half or more. A big uncoupling from GameA. Like education, navigating health and health care will require a Health Group that does the research and calls the play. And like education, health and health care ought to substantially benefit from shared learning with other ProtoBs and PreBs. Christian health ministries are already doing a version of a coop model of micro health care plans — they are picking up a number of folks displaced by disruptions and rising prices in the current system.

Since a new social operating system will emerge from the interaction of the constituent humans, improving human cognitive function using psycho-technologies has the potential for enabling better and stronger emergent ProtoBs that can outcompete and out attract GameA alternatives. Thus there is much that can be gained from community provided psycho-technologies curated specifically to upregulate the capabilities of the ProtoB as a whole. On the other hand, history has shown that these tools are potentially dangerous when misused and need to be brought forward with great discipline and discernment. We must be always alert to the risk that the pleasurable or reinforcing aspects of these practices may pull some people towards treating them as ends rather than means. \n — Powerful phenomena from the “mystical” range of human experience have also long been associated with exploitation by “priests, gurus, quacks, and swamis” who use the powerful desire of people to repeat such experiences to gain undue control over them, resulting in cults. Likewise the history of approaches such as medical psychoanalysis having a pattern of practitioners consciously or unconsciously inducing learned helplessness and dependency around a technique that in the end didn’t work nearly as well as other techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, that are faster, much less expensive, and less intrusive.\n — Jamie Wheal has done some good thinking on how to gain the benefits of psycho-technologies while avoiding bad outcomes. His How To Avoid Cults is worthwhile as is his Ethical Cult Checklist .\n — ProtoBs that choose to use powerful psycho-technologies need to develop strong immune system defenses in advance against the known failure modes around these tools. And be alert to new failure modes arising.\n — #JimSez getting psycho-technology right may be both the hardest and among the most important means of creating powerful, growing, and meta-stable ProtoBs; gaining great capability while avoiding their hazards. That won’t be easy. It won’t happen naturally. It will require serious attention.",
