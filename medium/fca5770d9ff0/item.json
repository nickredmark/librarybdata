Together with the team of Gaia Education, I had the pleasure to develop a flashcard based day-long training of multipliers entitled ‘Achieving the Global Goals — One community at a time’. The training aims to stimulate local conversations about which SDGs are particularly relevant in a given community and what existing and potential projects could help in their implementation at the local and regional scale. The flexible and highly replicable flash-card based approach has been very well received by UNESCO and the cards are currently being translated into the 5 main UN languages.",

Since the workshop, news of its success has spread through social media and Gaia Education has already been invited by community groups in Madrid and Barcelona to offer more trainings of multiplieres in May and June 2017. After the successful trainings in Hamburg (December 2016), Majorca (January 2017), the next training of multipliers will be held near Bangkok in Thailand (February 2017).

There is no point in criticizing the United Nations for an imperfect formulation of the goals. We all have an opportunity to give them local relevance, meaning and gravitas through collaboratively adapting them to the bio-cultural uniqueness of the places we inhabit.",

I look forward to working with them on the ‘SDG Lab ResCoMun’ in Barcelona in June 2017. Achieving the Global Goals is in our hands, and the ‘SDG Community Implementation Flashcards’ I developed together with the team of Gaia Education are offered in the spirit of helping you to become a multiplyer and take a more active part in this in your own community. Once the cards have been translated into the five officilal UN languages they will be available for purchase through the Gaia Education website. Let’s achieve the Global Goals together, one community at a time!",
