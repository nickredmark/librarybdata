The tech-trends of the last 20 years should serve to deepen, enhance, open-up, broadly distribute etc these marketplaces and their effects. What we see all around us is the ‘hijacking’ of these marketplaces by various ‘anti-democratic’ and ‘anti-market’ institutions: money distorting the marketplace of political ideas, myopic corporate self-interest distorting the marketplace of product ideas, sclerotic bureaucracies distorting the academic marketplace of educational ideas, and even financial engineering distorting the marketplace of the money-signal itself.",

Generally this will be a technological / infrastructural level that changes some of the “laws of physics” constraining what is possible. In the mid 90’s this was things like web publishing and search which resulted in an undermining of the premises of the news/magazine publishing industry. Then MP3 which undermined the distribution foundation of the music industry. Then digital video which is showing signs of eroding the copyright protected oligopology of the film and television industry (see Netflix, Amazon, HBO moving into the full supply chain). More recently, we’ve been watching the infrastructural change of the Kindle combine with Amazon’s previous disruptions around marketing and distribution put the final touches on the disruption of the book publishing industry.",
