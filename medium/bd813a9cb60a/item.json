Moreover, once a person or organization has received a proxy, they too can further pass it on to another individual or organizational Delegate. At any time, a voter can take back his or her proxy and either reassign it to a different Delegate or vote directly. Details here.",

If the final price tag for the 2016 presidential and congressional elections was around $6.5 billion, and Congress and the legislative branch cost about $6 billion to operate yearly, this $12 billion allowance can be seen as a reasonable, within-scale number, and it could be adjusted upward or downward as experience dictates.",
