He emphasized an inventory of a region’s hydrology, geology, flora, fauna, climate and natural topography, as well as its social and economic opportunities and challenges. As such, the Geddesian methodology pioneered the bioregional planning approach almost a century before the emergence of bioregionalism.",

Geddes was the archetype of an academic that could not be confined to a single discipline and either a purely practical or a purely theoretical focus for his endeavours.

Based on his biological understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems, Geddes suggested that a high degree of specialization in the function of an organism within a highly complex society would lead to a decrease of individual competition.",

Geddes warned that the specialization of labour — if not balanced with profoundly interdisciplinary education — could have detrimental effects on individual, cultural and eventually environmental health (in Meller, 1993).",

He argued that the “key objective of the biological principles of economics was not food and shelter but culture and education”(in Meller, 1993, p.60). For Geddes, the creation of an educated, and regionally adapted culture was the prerequisite for the long-term assurance of the provision of food and shelter for all citizens.",

          "text": "Helen Meller has suggested that it was this conviction, which lead Geddes to pronounce his famous dictum “social evolution depends on art” (in Meller, 1993, p.60). Geddes believed a society was able to evolve healthily if its people and their livelihoods were adapted to the specific conditions of their local region. Such adaptation required a form of interdisciplinary education that made people aware of how their livelihood fitted into the overall pattern of adapting local culture to local nature. In Geddes opinion, art and architecture had the dual function of expressing and educating about the symbiotic relationship between nature and culture.",
