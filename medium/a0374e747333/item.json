          "text": "One of the short-comings of the term sustainability is that it does not imply what it is we are trying to sustain in the first place. The author offered one possible answer in his doctoral thesis Design for Human and Planetary Health: A Holistic Integral Approach to Complexity and Sustainability. Three years later, he links theory to practice, exploring his work as a catalyst of integrative design thinking, educator, and bridge-builder between academic disciplines, between ecovillages and universities, between approaches to sustainability at different scales of design, and between public sector, business and civil society. Key concepts guiding his approach are: education as metadesign; temporally and spatially scale-linking design (Wahl, 2007); salutogenic (health-generating) design (Wahl, 2006a); and the natural design movement (Wahl, 2006b). Central to this participatory approach is the role of designers as transdisciplinary integrators and facilitators (Wahl & Baxter, 2008). Appropriate and responsible design in the face of converging crisis like climate change, peak oil, natural resource depletion and growing national and international inequity has to acknowledge complexity, interconnectedness, unpredictability. Awareness of multiple perspectives can positively influence innovative design thinking, resulting in more flexible and resilient design solutions. Beyond sustainability lies an attitude of designing with and as a part of nature, learning from natural process how to meet human needs within the limits set by the biosphere. Such design thinking is based on a metadesign (worldview) shift that transcends the Cartesian split and understands the reciprocal co-dependence of nature and culture.",

This view takes design far beyond the beautification of material objects, graphic design, technological inventions, and the support of a culture of consumption through fashion and marketing.

Such responsible design acknowledges humanity’s collective dependence on the planetary life-support systems that sustain the health of the biosphere, ecosystems, as well as human communities and individuals. The natural design movement is characterized by biophilia, an innate love of life and living systems (Wilson, 1984). Responsible design nurtures biophilia as an innately human characteristic.",

Participants so far included designers, community organizers, public servants, planning and architecture professionals, entrepreneurs, activists, educators, academics, consultants, and more. Former course participants have initiated wide range of projects as a result of this empowering programme. It enables and inspires individuals to move beyond the politics of protest or an economic growth and techno-fix focussed sustainable development agenda and to take the creation of a more ecological, socially just, equitable, and spiritually meaningful society into their own hands.",
