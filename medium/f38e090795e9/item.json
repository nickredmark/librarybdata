          "text": "The design of sustainable communities and cities requires conceptual frameworks for contextualization and transdisciplinary integration. The theory of complex dynamic systems provides a holistic, explanatory frame- work offering a participatory perspective that recognizes the fundamental interconnectedness, interdependence, and unpredictability of biological, social, economic, and ecological systems. Building on the tradition of urban planning within a regional context, to conceive the sustainable city as an emergent property of appropriate interactions and relationships within a complex, holarchically structured whole, takes contextualization further. Increased awareness of nature and culture as an interconnected complex dynamic system, and sensitivity to material and immaterial (psychological) aspects, leads to more sustainable solutions based on transdisciplinary integration. Worldviews and value systems, and ecological literacy play an important role in the creation of sustainable lifestyles, communities, cities and societies. This article suggests that complexity theory, combined with aspects of integral theory and integral ecology, when applied through design as a transdisciplinary integrator, can provide a framework and a methodology that links spatial and temporal scales across all scales of design from product design, architecture, construction ecology, community design, industrial ecology, to urban and biore- gional planning. Ultimately, a sustainable city emerges from the interactions among sustainable communities of ecologically and socially literate citizens who live sustainable lifestyles.",

Yet, the cold and techno- logically focussed intellect of research science will have to be balanced by other ways of knowing. Decision-making should not be based on the advice of expert scientists and economists alone. It will have to include other epistemologies that value not only social, cultural, ethical, aesthetical and psychological (spiritual) considerations, but also the wisdom of traditional cultures with all their place-based knowledge and locally adapted practices.",

The earliest written record of humanity, the Epic of Gilgamesh, tells the story of the demise of the ancient city of Ur and the Sumerian civilization due to inappropriate environmental resource management in the form of rapid deforestation and subsequent downwind desertification and salination, which turned fertile Mesopotamia into the arid ecosystems of modern day Iraq [16].",

In doing so, Lyle described the holarchical, after Arthur Koestler [23], structure of healthy and sustainable processes. Lyle [22] explained: ‘Our range of design scales forms a hierarchy that corresponds to the concept of levels of integration in nature or in any organized system.’ He believed: ‘Certain principles of organization link the levels of this hierarchy and provide guidance for design at any given level’ (p. 17).

This is not to say that the diversity of human worldviews, value systems and psychological states can be reduced to the material level of biology and ecology alone, but it does stress that even if our various conceptions of nature may be culturally constructed, we are biological organisms dependent on life-supporting atmospheric conditions.

Changes in lifestyle critically depend on our worldview and value system, thus it is crucial to also consider the immaterial (psychological) dimension of the sustainability transition. Long-term sustainability depends on widespread lifestyle changes, constant learning, flexibility, and appropriate adaptation in response to a dynamically chang- ing world.

The main principles of this vision are summarized in Table 1. Kennedy and Kennedy emphasize, ‘What unites all these aspects … is that they strive for … an optimisation of the whole, rather than a maximisation of individual parts, and thus a new quality of housing and indeed life itself’ (p. 211). Such a holistic, quality focussed, systemically optimizing approach to designing sustainable communities and cities is characteristic of scale-linking design systemic health.",

Barton argues: ‘Health of our community, health of our city, health of our planet, health of our children — all have a convincing ring, and health relates very well to the reasons for reinventing neighbourhoods: local work, safety, community, equity, climate stability, clean air and water etc.’ Barton concludes: ‘Linking the health and the environment agenda together begins to provide a constituency of political support that can make things happen’ (pp. 248–249).",

It has to be linked to the larger and smaller biophysical scales within the holarchy of a healthy biosphere; and needs to be considered from within multiple perspectives. Sustainable design has to confront the complexity of interdependent social, cultural, economic and ecological issues. The creation of sustainable cities is an important aspect of the wicked problem of sustainability. Ultimately, sustainability requires a widespread shift in human consciousness towards an awareness of individual responsibility for how our actions affect the wider social, cultural and ecological processes in which we participate. This requires participatory processes in which re-empowered citizens are given access to insights gained from within a wide variety of perspectives, disciplines, professional practices, worldviews, and value systems. Such a process can change attitudes and life styles.",

In the end, only a profound change in attitudes, a spiritual and ethical change, can bring the deeper transformation required’ (p. 274). Scale-linking, synergistic, symbiotic, and salutogenic design, ultimately aims to maintain the natural co-dependence and co-evolution of the whole and its parts. Such design aims to strengthen the health and sustainability of the scale-linking holarchy that unites the individual with the community of life itself. From this perspective, all design for sustainability is also sacred design as it contextualizes the individual within a meaningful and mutually supportive context of a healthy and life-sustaining whole.",
