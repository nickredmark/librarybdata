We will need elements of the present as we build the future. This is why revolution is wrong and can’t work. If you sweep all away there is nothing to transform, you end up recreating what’s familiar to give you something to work with. There is a danger that the transitional structures, built on H1 will simply serve to reinforce the H1 horizon — think of fracking as a means of maintaining the fossil fuel economy and strangling genuine transitional structures. Wahl recognises that transition must work to make the established ways obsolete and not simply reform them. In his words they need to be disruptive transitions, not simply replacing the old but also fulfilling the necessary services provided by these old structures while paving the way to better outcomes.",

We need to deeply question this process: ‘is it life enhancing? Is it inclusive, drawing on all of our creative diversity? Does the process itself increase our collective wellbeing, our ability to be happy, to experience joy, to create beauty now? Does the process allow all of nature, and therefore people as part of nature, to flourish? If so, the process creates a good life, it is progressive, it will create a sustainable present. If not, then we must change the process. That is our mission.",
