These three books show, in different ways, how we can apply this understanding to contemporary local and global challenges so as create a future in which we live in harmony with ourselves, each other and nature — for universal benefit. They tell a new story of fundamental importance.",

Drawing on a wide range of contemporary sources, especially in the field of applied ecology, he seeks to both inform and inspire our collective efforts to make the fundamental change from a destructive separateness from the rest of life (intrinsic to capitalism, globalisation and our very careless use of fossil fuel based technologies) to a radically different perspective that unites humanity in our interdependence with the wider community of life (following Thich Nhat Hanh he calls this interbeing) and that helps us find ways of working with each other and nature to co-create the conditions for all life to flourish. This then is what he means by developing ‘regenerative cultures’: regenerative rather than merely sustaining because so much damage has been done already that we have a major task of restoration if we are to ensure that we leave a better world to each subsequent generation.",

          "text": "So Wahl shows how this approach is being increasingly applied successfully in many areas of life. Permaculture ideas are shaping the shift in agriculture to resilient local food systems (and showing how we can sequester carbon in the soil at the same time). New economics is showing us how to create circular economies — where all resources are used and re-used productively. Green thinking is helping us shift away from fossil fuels to solar power and production using plant-based chemistry. In a few jurisdictions, where indigenous cultures are still strong, we are seeing the law accord rights to all species and nature as a whole. And as we shall explore later, ecological thinking is a powerful basis for city planning and the development of sustainable communities.",
