At a human level, we would understand this as when someone discovers that their Facebook friend is a “gun nut / grabber” and, therefore, unfriends them. At a machinic level, what we see is a package of semantics flowing across relationships that result in the asymmetric transformation of those relationships.

I imagine that it wouldn’t be much work to empower an AI to post ads on Craigslist (etc) to gather and hand out those protest signs.
