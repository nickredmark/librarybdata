Yet companies seem to be unable to stop themselves from driving customers further up-market. This distorts the overhead burden on low-end products (or services) and makes them unsustainable. Therefore, companies are happy to secede low-market segments to upstarts who have come looking for them. The upstarts are happy to enter there, because they get the benefit of an already engaged consumer base, while their costs structures are leaner, and their operations more agile, so their overhead burden remains in balance. The larger company then can off-load the areas of their business that are unsustainable and get a short-term benefit in the form of a sharp reduction in costs, which can be banked as a spike in profits. As older companies keep pushing themselves further and further upmarket, upstarts (there may be more than one) are increasing their capacity to assume more market segments. Eventually the original company is displaced entirely.",
