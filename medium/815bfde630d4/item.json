          "text": "A philosophy of education based on transformation and human flourishing would switch the inquiry from how much is the student learning, to what kind of person is the student becoming? If you are an educator, this is probably a daunting statement. It leads to an overwhelming responsibility for one individual. This is why, if the educational system is going to take on the responsibility for the character of the person, it must undergo a significant structural change. In early childhood, when the task is most daunting, it means something like an entire village must be created to meet this challenge and to support educators in their responsibility. Thought of in this way, the prospects become more positive. We are looking at the possibilities of a learning village for youth, much like local urban centers grow around university hubs. In this case, however, the best learning villages should be surrounded by gardens and farms, and beyond that, natural places — forests, wetlands, seashores, mountains and wilderness areas. There would be a major reversal of urban planning. Instead of being anchored around centers of production, with schools serving the demands of the economy, communities would be anchored around centers of learning, with production becoming both an outcome of education and a handmaiden to it.",

What then is the role of schooling from the perspective of a powerful elite who are vested in maintaining the status quo of a deeply stratified society, with wealth and power concentrated in the hands of the few? This is a tricky question, which requires us to reimagine what an economy is. We are trained to think of an economy as having demands for laborers or workers in the knowledge sectors.

From the perspective of the power-brokers, the goal is to preserve the mechanisms of redistributing wealth and power from the many to the few. This is what a capitalist system has always been. What would this look like? We are seeing many of the mechanisms already taking shape. The Federal Bank would lend money to the state by printing currency in amounts and at an interest rate they themselves set.

There would be no tax on federally distributed income. There might, however, be a negative interest charged on the accumulation of income (“savings”) which would drive consumer spending. The net effect is the state switching from one based on the accumulation of wealth, to one on the displacement of debt. Debt will become the new GDP![1] Certainly, as Graeber has argued, money has always been debt. The interest rate on the guaranteed income constitutes the “tax” that will eventually be paid to remunerate the banks, thereby securing one of the distribution mechanisms that is a mainstay of disparity in capitalist economies. The Fed therefore provides one loop.",

Purchases would be subject to a federal sales tax, funding the federal budget (a big chunk of which is the interest paid back to the fed.) It’s a kind of ponzi scheme that, given its level of complexity, allows us to pretend that the government is not giving with one hand, and taking more with the other.

Here, the turn toward solar power and electric will supply the missing piece. This is what the robots themselves will be run on. There is however, an enormous cost to be paid, with respect to the continued devastation of the planet. We will simultaneously be extracting resources at ever increasing levels, and trying to control the earth and its life force, including human beings, through complex AI surveillance and AI-initiated “interventions.”\n \n Neither the left nor the right offers a viable option. We can merely characterize one side as championing one of the loops (production and banking monopolies) while the other champions the other (free goods and services and free money too!). The robots, AI, the IOT, and smart machines will make it all inevitable. In the meantime, people must be trained on a mass level to be consumers. It is to the consumer self that schooling targets. And this is why school has to be obligatory and, eventually all schooling will have to be “free.” “ In each country,” Illich (1972) wrote, “the amount of consumption by the college graduate sets the standard for all others; if they would be civilized people on or off the job, they will aspire to the style of life of college graduates.”",

          "text": "The university thus has the effect of imposing consumer standards at work and at home, and it does so in every part of the world, and under every political system. … The ability of the university to fix consumer goals is something new. In many countries the university acquired this power only in the sixties, as the delusion of equal access to public education began to spread. Before that, the university protected an individual’s freedom of speech, but did not automatically convert his knowledge into wealth. To be a scholar in the Middle Ages meant to be poor, even a beggar. By virtue of his calling, the medieval scholar learned Latin, became an outsider worthy of the scorn as well as the esteem of peasant and prince, burgher and cleric. To get ahead in the world, the scholastic first had to enter it by joining the civil service, preferably that of the Church. The old university was a liberated zone for discovery and the discussion of ideas both new and old. Masters and students gathered to read the text of other masters, now long dead, and the living words of the dead masters gave new perspective to the fallacies of the present day. The university was then a community of academic quest and endemic unrest. (pg. 35)",

And yet there has never been more demand from students to enter that very system. The demands of the young generations are tolerated because they play into the hands of the elite who get to see the future they are planning for, unfolding before their very eyes. By the time the students graduate they will be hooked on consuming education as experience, information as entertainment, social media as connection, and prescription drugs as a commodity. Note: these are all major demands of the radical left.",

Their green new deal will usher in the IOT, and the centralized control of surveillance capitalism. The environment will suffer even more, but topics such as intersectionalism and identity politics will drown out the voices of the few remaining stewards of the earth. The vastly accumulating power of AI will enable unprecedented centralization of power and colonization of the life force. Recent disaster events have shown this is exactly the opposite kind of society we need to survive catastrophic events such as climate crisis and pandemics, since resilience to such events requires distributed, local centers of responsive action. China’s response to recent outbreaks of Covid-19 is a good indication of things to come our way.",
