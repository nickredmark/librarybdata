The aim is transdisciplinary integration, intersubjective consensus and synthesis. The discourse is necessarily presented through the author’s own subjective point of view. In order to transcend dualistic thinking one has to be aware that to argue for one position (thesis) does not necessarily imply the negation of the partial validity of its opposite (antithesis).",

To him this larger conception of self is fundamentally interconnected with a larger mind that manifests through the process of life itself.

An ethic, philosophically, is a differentiation of social and antisocial conduct.” Leopold continues: “These are two definitions of one thing which has its origin in the tendency of interdependent individuals and groups to evolve modes of cooperation.”13 Human, ecosystem and planetary health are interdependent.14 This makes the future and health of all life an important ethical concern.

Both words are terms for knowing in the widest sense.”18 This semantic insight emphasises that there is an upstream end to design and technology.

          "text": "What is needed is a cultural/civilisational change from design in a technological/materialistic context that may ultimate lead to von Neumann’s ‘singularity’, to design in a salutogenic and sacred context that will bring about the age of sustainment. We need to shift from isolated zero-sum design to a fundamentally interconnected way of non zero-sum designing. The age of sustainment will be characterised by win-win-win design — design for life, health, and well-being. The author details elsewhere why sustainable design is therefore by necessity symbiotic, synergistic, scale-linking, salutogenic (health generating), and sacred design!49",

What follows is recognition that the way in which we make things, and the way in which those things act, has a profound effect upon how we ourselves are made, and what we become. In this frame, work on or with the ecological systems will always be equally a reaching out, a touching, and a changing of the social ecology, the ecology of community that demands the myth of the value of life as given from elsewhere — the sacred.”50 — Tony Fry, 1996",

The emergence of a culture of sustainment, whose material designs and conceptual metadesigns future rather than defuture, will require us to transcend and include reductionist, either/or thinking and the logic of subject object separation.",
