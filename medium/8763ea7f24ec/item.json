They could read the conditions of environment. The nuances of the leaves, the texture of the dirt, the timing of the flowers and birds. The ancient ways of not-knowing, were in fact ways of knowing. But without a plan or a clear vision of the goal, the mechanistic thinkers of today get anxious. The addiction to the spreadsheet the KPI and the board approval for a specific outcome is not just not working… it is in fact prohibiting real work at a systemic level.

Technological? Of course, it is woven through all of those contexts. And where then is the direct corrective? Give that mother living in her car with her kids anti-depressants as a corrective to her state of mind, and she will be less able to be in her activated emotional self with her kids. The kids will soon feel alone, and act out in school… and they get another diagnosis — there is a pill for that. Later they learn to sell those pills, and more police are needed. Grace might look more like responding to the deeper seas of our shared lives. How are we describing each other? How are describing our world? Are we becoming — those descriptions?",

Like a scientific, mathematic translation of the mystery of life that the secular scholar could relate to. Complexity was a new possibility to bring in to save us from silos. The possibility for significant change was there until ‘complexity’ was ironically reclaimed by the complexity of the society. It got McKinsey-ed into irrelevant bullshit rationalization for furthering profit by the corporate coaching culture. It was sold in 1000 forms and products, first it was a watery version of Zen, then VUCA, it gradually became a spiritual task of being able to hold “uncertainty” like learning to lift barbells — -The script of how to be the better ‘uncertainty’ practitioner became a multi-million dollar seminar competition. Who knows the best way to not know? The shallowest of mindfulness trainings held it up as their mantra. The most treasured peace of mind in the stress of corporate culture was to be to “stay in the flow” — and to embrace uncertainty, (but show up on Monday with that report and work all weekend on that power-point for the merger). But the unseen is, fifty years after the systems theorists , thousands years after the indigenous peoples — still unseen.",

Taste a new food and the first thing you do is compare it to something you have eaten before. But, the trap is trapping us. The system is allergic to systems. The context is allergic to context. It’s a matrix. How to really perceive something you have not perceived before when the perception itself is tracking onto the familiar? How to describe in new ways when language is harkening old meanings?

Many have little to no education, and are in what have been labeled ‘vulnerable’ communities and carry varying trauma diagnoses. Their situation is complex, clearly. Poverty is experienced as economic, but those who are living with it know that it is produced through culture, politics, education, health etc. Whereas economic comfort is more readily described as linear, earned, deserved. Comfort is, in my experience, probably the greatest obstruction to an embodied perception of complexity. Some are surprised by this, thinking that a mental state of openness is needed to perceive the liminal, the unknown. My experience with many hundreds of people now, has been the opposite.",
