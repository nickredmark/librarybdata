And I was completely ignorant of any of these issues, like I think most people, even today who work in big finance. Even with the rise of all of the ESG (environmental, social and governance), and sustainability conversation, the understanding of this issue, particularly a regenerative system is still missing from Wall Street, by and large. But I worked in a different time at Morgan. It was a very different culture. It was a very positive experience for the most part. And I left in 2001, really in response to a nagging itch that I had that started many years earlier.",

And things started to happen very quickly after that, and probably the highlight or the low light, but the most impactful was that the first day I went back to the city after taking the summer off to begin “what’s the next part of my life?” happened to be 9/11. And so I experienced that. Ironically, I had a meeting with a charter school CEO downtown at 9:30 in the morning, (I was doing impact investing already), and I was thinking about getting involved in the education challenge. And with a meeting at 9:30, that means I was in the subway at 9:10. And I got to the street in lower Manhattan at the moment when the second plane hit.",

And so to answer your question, I spent the next several years dabbling in various entrepreneurial projects, but mostly sitting in this building, which is a converted barn, set up as a home office, reading books. And I’m not an academic by background and I just started reading stuff somewhat randomly. I was sort of a self-select, self-taught PhD in truth, and discovered the environmental crisis. Read Limits to Growth, read Kirchhoff’s work on systems. And it was mind blowing because I came to this rolling understanding that everything I thought was true was not possible physically. The physics of exponential growth on a finite planet don’t work. And as a finance guy, I know that the economy is driven by finance and if the economic premise of our entire global economy is in conflict with the laws of physics, we have a serious problem.",

And the guy looked at me and he said something to the effect of, well, something I wouldn’t say on your recording. He told me where I could go. And I just said, my life is not about dealing with little shit head traders who tell me where to go when I hand them a big check at the end of the year.

I guess it was my quasi ‘dark night of the soul’, where I was really questioning who I was and what my purpose was, and then the financial crisis happened. Suddenly, my friends who I’d been sharing this with didn’t think I was crazy anymore. So I created the Capital Institute — I was working on it in 2009 and launched it in 2010 — really as a place to ask these questions. And I had, by then, discovered Herman Daly and ecological economics, and was wrestling with this growth issue. But only through some of my investment projects in agriculture, did I discover regenerative thinking.",

So the things we are taught, and beliefs, our self-evident truth are actually in conflict with a holistic worldview. And it’s pretty hard to change someone’s belief system once it’s wired in.

And the economy, I see this every time when we try to create the meta collaborative networks between different organizations, where each organization that we’re trying to bring together is a really valuable organization doing really beautiful work. The potential that they could unleash if a number of organizations really started to work on synergy and transformative systemic work is enormous, but very often being stuck to some degree in that degenerative economic system pushes each one of these organizations, understandably, to some extent, to first look after their own tribe that has been doing good work to enable them to continue to do the good work. And when that’s sure and safe, then they might be able to invest some extra time into the bigger story. But if they’re struggling financially, they’re not going to spend a lot of time looking at the larger picture of collaboration across organizations. And it’s not merging them, it’s working with the diversity of these organizations, and bringing them up to that next level of complexity where they can really have a transformative effect.",

And again, the donor foundations all had their pathway to success, like ‘how do I apply what I learned, being a clever guy in the.com industry in Silicon Valley to gaining impact on positive things around the world’? Really well meaning, but driving small organizations on the ground to apply some kind of California standard of key performance indicators to their work in order to be more effective and scale up more quickly. “Scale up”, is what they always say. That distinction alone that bigger is better rather than place- sourced, working from the uniqueness of place, not copy/pasting solutions, but really adapting solutions to place. It’s so vital if we want to work regeneratively. And none of these foundations get that, unfortunately.",

If you really go down to it, what we’re all saying is what the indigenous cultures understood and have been saying, but in a language that is hard for us to translate into a Western kind of understanding.

I try to make it sort of something that the current paradigm can’t simply reject out of hand. And so my language is such that it will be acceptable. And that limits it to some audiences, probably.

The business round table last summer came out with this new statement, “Hey, how about if corporations had a purpose?” And of course that’s the same statement that the business round table had as its premise in 1982, when I started at JP Morgan. And it was only in the, I don’t know, early nineties, I think, that the Milton Friedman school sort of took over, and they said the purpose is to maximize shareholder value!",

And this is very different than just the circular economy, which of course it’s important to efficiently use our scarce resources. This is circulation meaning healthy inputs into the system, robust circulation into all parts of the system from the top to the bottom, and then an ability to emit our wastes in a way that don’t pollute our nest. That’s how a metabolism works.",

And that’s one of the conversations that I find the circular economy people aren’t paying enough attention to, despite the fact that their elders, which are really the industrial ecologists, paid a lot of attention to that. If you read the early books on industrial ecology, they say the biggest punch, bang for your buck, so to speak, if you want to use the old language, is by re-regionalizing the cycles. It becomes less efficient and more wasteful the minute the cycles gets long. And that’s where that meets with also the Capital Institute’s call for more bio-regional economies.",

But I don’t think a lot of people understand it very well. And unfortunately, even to my mind, the complexity science community, when it first formed, where kind of the old systems theorists met insights from chaos theory and created something deeper and more dynamic with complex adaptive systems as a thought form, one of the key insights of the early people working on this was that complex dynamic systems are fundamentally unpredictable and uncontrollable.

And I think the reason I’m so passionate about them is that I’ve actually seen, and I could go through each and every one of these and give an example, and I do in the paper and I’ll do a better job in the book, but I’ve seen them not only operate in projects that I’ve been involved in, but I’ve seen them in operation in 50 projects that we’ve told the story about where they’ve just happened organically or the leaders of the project have intuited them, and certainly never read my paper, but never even thought of them as principles.

That’s because they’re responding to the pressures and the context that’s destroying our food system. And so to me, the proof that they’re real is that they’re already emergent in the real world. And for me, the value of trying to reduce them to language is to help us all to see this source of future prosperity and the direction we need to go, and to show where our current paradigm is completely in conflict with these principles.

And if we checked against principles, and now I’m talking specifically about the problem of the public corporation and public capital markets. So the premise of ESG is that if we make the E in environmental and social and governance issues transparent, the markets will solve this problem. Because we believe in a market system, and if markets have the right information, they do their magic, Adam Smith’s invisible hand.

And she said something that, as Nora just knows how to do, everybody had been talking about, “Wait, we can’t do with incremental change anymore. We need transformative change.” And then at the very end of everybody proposing their transformative changes, it was Nora’s turn to ask everybody in the room to say, “Are we double checking that what we’re calling transformative innovation is going to make sure that we end up with butterflies and not with caterpillars with wings?” And I think that that image just brings it down so deeply.",

And I was really delighted when I read in with Regenerative Communities Network and all the wonderful network that the Capital Institute has helped birth with these initiatives around the world, where people are committing to trying to regenerate economic activity at the bio-regional scale, and trying to look into providing basic human needs and a new kind of prosperity to people in place, sourced out of place at that kind of watershed scale. Because for me, after spending a lot of time looking at the community scale and intentional communities and little experiments of how do we walk our talk, I realized that you need the bio-regional scale, you need a city in there, you need small communities, you need ecosystems. It’s a larger scale at which the whole system’s designed where these kinds of principles can really come together to transform something. It happens.",

So the context here is human economy and geological facts and the nature that they enable. And human culture comes into contact at a bioregional scale. And I think when people think about it, wherever you live or wherever you call home, you can get a vision of what’s unique about that place that is different from other places. And if people have a choice, they tend to move to a place that is either what they know, because that’s where they grew up, or what they are attracted to for some almost spiritual reasons. Some people are attracted to mountains, some people are attracted to the ocean, etc.",

I use the word honor by intention, obviously, and again, this is humans being humble to the greater essence and nature of place that exists, whether or not we’re there.

The way living systems take change to scale is through this networking, through scaling out and replication. And she’s got a brilliant little short paper.

Small, wonderful projects, place sourced projects, doing real regeneration. A lot of them, ecological, some of them social, all around the world. And we had, I mean, wonderfully generous from Lush. We had 210,000 pounds to give away to 11 projects, which is a nice thing to be able to do, but it’s peanuts of money. And the frustration of choosing out of these 50 was always extremely high. And what was born out of that, was the conversation of how do we give more value to all these runner-ups that have already gone through a due diligence processes and have been checked on by the people from the Ethical Consumer Magazine, the Lush stuff, then the judges? And how do we, A. showcase them to the world, make them visible to each other, so they don’t feel alone in their struggle, and showcase them to possible funders.

And imagine if then, they were the flywheel or the engine to build co-benefits within each of their buyer regions. So that there, again, not isolated projects working in a great, big, wide world on their own, but we harness the energy that they’re throwing off already, into Bioregions, so that we get this amplifying effect at a bioregional scale. That, to me, is the… The hard thing is to build a flywheel. Once you get a flywheel going, it gets much easier to build on it. And flywheels usually take courage, and creativity, and capital, and guts, and sweat, and tears to get going.

We’ve already ripped up the Great Prairies, which are these massive perennial carbon sinks, and converting them to corn and soybeans to feed cattle. So, what’s the difference? And then, why aren’t we up in arms about what we’ve done in the Great Plains, the way we’re up in arms about burning down the Amazon? We should be.",

But it’s interesting, because just a couple of weeks ago, I had a public talk here in Majorca, where the topic was the potential for Majorca to be an example of bioregional regeneration, and how islands are special cases within bioregions because they’re even better defined boundaries. And that, actually enables a lot. And then, of course, Majorca is a sub-case, where the economy is so dependent on tourism, that you have to do a… turning the problem into the solution, I keep with the system. If you want to change anything in Majorca, you have to also ask the question, what would regenerative tourism look like? How could tourism give back to a region?",
