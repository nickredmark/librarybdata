This includes timing of different phases, modular and physical design dependency, and feedback loops that are part of the workflow design. In modern organizations, workflow staging has become a specialized profession, involving enterprise engineers assisted by computers. This combination is a recipe for over-complexification. The route dependencies that people have to execute are often such complex Rube Goldberg devices that it takes another computer to figure it out. A colleague of mine makes these invisible forces of complexity apparent to people in a stunning way: He has people sit in a large room and passes out spools of yarn. Each person represents a node in the route network. By passing the yarn back and forth and across and around, to each other, they trace all the route dependencies built into the software, creating a dense hammock of yarn between them. This treatment is not for the faint of heart.",

This is the reason why cybernetic designs tend to factor exponentially, and cede to the law of requisite variety.

          "text": "The problem with chasing technologically-driven cybernetic complexity in workflow design, is that it assumes by default that smart machines can improve on human performance, without questioning the structures that people are expected to perform against. In other words, we are increasingly designing for what machines are good at and decreasingly for what the human operating system is good at. Too much reliance on cybernetic control — which is fundamentally mechanistic control, however sophisticated the machines become — dulls the human imagination and creates built environments that erode the human spirit. Machines may be getting smarter, but we need to be careful that we are not slowly but surely measuring “smartness” on the basis of what it is to be a machine, rather than on the basis of what it is to be a living, embodied, human being. The conventional workplace tends to miss the latter terms entirely. It is arguably the case, that machines seem to becoming more like humans, because humans are becoming more like machines; and most likely the case that the movement is in both directions. It is also arguably true, that as society becomes more complex in richness and diversity, those who are in control, are more comfortable with cybernetic systems because only those systems allow them to maintain leveraged, top-down control that is derived from strongly asymmetric, fixed power roles.",

Workflow options are kept open, allowing teams to continuously redesign and reprioritize performance objectives. Agile teams employ simple production practices that constrain the workload and distribute it in rhythms that best suit human needs. Most importantly, they combine iterative practices with rituals that facilitate communication on daily, weekly, bi-weekly and other time periods that correlate communications with larger and larger strategic needs.",

The critical role of technology will be to allow for universal access to communication and information, and methods for deep inquiry and learning on the part of humans. This will allow for complex route dependencies to be de-coupled from single-outcome strategies and allow teams to design for multiple futures — a critical capacity when working with non-linear dynamics in complex systems.",

Each track will be operationally independent, but the teams themselves will be able to remain in a strategically integrated, coherent state, accessing the synergistic advantages of performing as a “team of teams.” As their parallel explorations inform and unfold emergent possibility, their strategic conversations will inform and unfold workflow practices that shape the future for everyone. Eventually, multiple parallel flows converge toward a single future outcome, unforseen at the start. This single outcome, however, will only be a snapshot — the terminal bud of an iterative cycle in a larger workflow era. Information rapidly diverges, calling for another round of prototyping and developing.",
