In an OSV, value is provided to users in some effort to equal the\nvalue that they contribute. This can be done through a number of\nmechanisms, but an easy example is equity: Reddit should be owned by\nits community. A potential vector —- Reddit goes public, but does\nnot list on an exchange. Rather, it complies with the ‘34 Act but\nlaunches its own internal exchange: only Reddit members can hold\nReddit shares and can sell only to one-another (on the internal\nexchange). (SAIC did this for a long time.) On a continuing basis,\nReddit members are *issued* equity in accord with rules associated to\ntheir contribution of value (e.g., posts, comments, karma (!),\nfriends, minutes on the site, etc.). There is a lot of complexity in\nwiring this correctly, but its not mayhem. This notion can be\nfruitfully linked up with any/all of the ideas above and has the\nnotable advantage of providing liquidity for existing investors\nwithout sacrificing the community on the Nasdaq altar.
