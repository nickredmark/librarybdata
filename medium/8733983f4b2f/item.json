Where are we willing to claim continuity and where are we compelled to claim change? Is the lowland forest resilient because it can change into a wetland-pond? or is it fragile because it succumbs to the flooding? Think further ahead, when the pond is abandoned, and becomes fertile soil and fragrant meadow. Here, do we see continuity or change? Eventually, the meadow is reclaimed by the signature species of the forest. Now, we might say, the forest is indeed resilient, because it has regenerated itself.",

The important distinction they make is between external and internal relations. To jump to the chase: resilience must refer to the internal relations shared among participants, as well as their external relations. A system with only a lot of external relations (more commonly called ‘connections’) is complicated, not complex and therefore cannot display resilience. If it has enough connections, and all those are cybernetically leveraged against each other, such systems can be profoundly resistent to change. But resistence is not the same as resilient.",
