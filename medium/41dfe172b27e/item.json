More people are recognizing that the economic paradigm that guides our global system today is deeply misaligned with a thriving future. Some note the myopia of short-termism in the blind pursuit of quarterly returns for multinational corporations (or election results in political arenas). Others elevate the exploding levels of debt in the financial system where money is created by issuing loans that must be paid back with interest, a dynamic that underlies the foundational need for continued growth of a debt-based currency system to avoid stall out and collapse. Yet others still see how the influence of money — in various forms of capital assets — is profoundly corrupting and shaping who gets elected to office, which policies are adopted, and how the system behaves at all scales ranging from local to regional to global.",
