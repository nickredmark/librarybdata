So, they hire us but it is hiring us to deliver a project. That is an outcome of the process, it is not the reason for the process. It is not the nature of the process. The process is about our evolution and how we evolve with that place in which we are building that project in and how that place and system informs the project. In order to do that we have to change our attitude of who we are. In order to work with the community in a different way, and work with the ecosystem in a different way in order to inform that project.

What is also interesting Daniel, I don’t know if you have heard me say this before, virtually every one of those clients except from one have hired us back within a year. That is powerful.

At the last meeting I was looking at what had actually moved and weather the potential is somehow affecting the way the development is done in 53 nations around the world, touching 2.4 Billion people. What a great opportunity! Ben told me for him the most important and confirmed outcome from it all is the learning that Freijo Jhost has done in the process of him mentoring her to run the project. And that is wonderful because that also speaks to the levels of work. She already did such wonderful work before she started working with Cloudburst Foundation and Common Earth. And now to have deepened under Ben’s mentoring into this way of working, it is guaranteed that for the rest of her life she will do amazing stuff.",

If somewhere in the world due to natural catastrophe or war or where there is the danger of having an epidemic break out, he is the first response team. He shared with me when he was a young man in the late mid-1980s he was part of a US government-sponsored project that pretty much concluded, in a report to the white house, that if we wouldn’t fundamentally change the way of doing things by the way of mid-1990s then somewhere by the 2020s and 2050s 4–5 Billion people would die on planet earth. If you look at the hard science they were right back then, that we haven’ changed anything since then. And we are pretty much on course for something as traumatic as that.",

So, he finds people who are doing work around sustainability who are kind and loving. That is his criteria. So, through whatever mechanism I have been invited to become part of that group and it is an amazing group of brilliant people. I was asked to prepare and run the next conference with Paul stalls who does something called the Adversity Quotient (AQ). He is a phycologist, neuroscientist and organizational development guy. This is now taught at Harvard and MIT and around the world. Instead of IQ, which doesn’t really indicate much about success. IQ is kind of a bullshit indicator. What he found out was people who handle adversity well are the people who are successful. So, he has developed tests and ways to improve your Adversity Quotion (AQ).",

Then I had one of the most wonderful conversations I have had all of last year with him connecting in a really deep way, on also very much a personal note. Long story short I was invited to Switzerland to a meeting that was about helping to bring more funding into large ecosystems restoration projects. Which are fundamental community focused and based and are all based on regenerisis language. They brought 24 of us together and slightly more than half of the group were from the funding philanthropy and impact investment world. The smaller half were people like Willem Ferwerda from Commonland or Phillipe Vireija from Renature. All people who had foundations that are doing that kind of work out there. Its people like the Omedajaa network, the E-bay people, IKEA foundation and Algor Investment fund. There are just huge amounts of money wanting to be poured into restoring damaged ecosystems, restoring or regenerating damaged communities. Really the money is there. The issue is, again this comes back to:",

So, our job is to keep pushing stuff out there in a gently destabilizing way. Which is by the way why we use the language we use. So that people are not assuming they understand while you are saying. Because when they assume you understand they don’t need you. If they actually go “well what does that word mean?” or “you are using it in a slightly different sense, how come you said that?” I always try to have a story associated to words so that people can image that in a new way.",

With a lot of what I learned in the regenerative practitioner there were moments where I felt there was a similarity with some of the work that I have drawn from through the International Futures forum particularly Tony Hatchun and Bill Sharp. Developed the Three Horizons framework and the World System Model. They have now curated a set of what they call generative methodologies and a way of helping people to explore getting closer to what regeneration would mean drawing heavily on particularly Pamela and Ben’s book or the Regenerations book. And they are fully aware of that there is this story that regenisis holds this very long curated process and linearing.
