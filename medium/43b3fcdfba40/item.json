Jean Russell had the inspiration to start a collective inquiry into the meaning of a word with transformative agency: Thriving. “What does thrivability mean to you?” Around this question Jean curated the co-creation of Thrivability — A Collaborative Sketch. Seventy of us from all walks of life and a diversity of places were invited to write a short reflection on the meaning of 60 words and phrases that relate like a broad map to this magnetic notion. “In the dance between the individual and humanity as a whole, there is an aliveness. In aliveness, there is a yearning for thriving”, writes Jean in the introduction. “All living things strive to move beyond survival to truly flourish.” A simple yet magnetic idea galvanized our enthusiasm and contributions: “that the goal of evolving our behavior should be to thrive” (Russell, 2010: 6), both individually and collectively.",
