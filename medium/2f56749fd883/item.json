Nonetheless, to the degree that it opens us into the unknown or the untried, that opening leaves us feeling unsafe, unsure and captured by fear.

This would eliminate both the massive and inefficient welfare state bureaucracy and the most painful edge of poverty. Nobel Prize winning economists came out in support. Martin Luther King, jr. wrote a book. Presidential candidates and politicians from all over the political spectrum supported it.",

My suggestion would be to examine combining a differential geometric index number-based inflation algorithm with demurrage. This would allow you to precisely measure realtime price inflation and then to elegantly exit an appropriate amount of money out of the system on a pro-rata basis. If prices start to rise, the demurrage rate ticks up and some fraction of the overall money supply evaporates. Quite similar really to a steam release valve in a steam engine. An approach like this could provide a completely transparent and highly efficient path to long term price stability that requires little to no human intervention.",

Some (lets call them the “Goldman Sachs approach”) are positioning themselves to do even better than they did in the last financial crisis. They are buying hard assets like farmland and water, minerals and energy. Others (the “alienated survivalists”) are doing the best they can to protect themselves ranging from financial hedges in precious metals to basements full of guns and canned goods. Pretty much everyone else is just trying to ignore it and quell their anxiety by trusting to hope that “everything will be OK”. In other words, fear is leading the way.
