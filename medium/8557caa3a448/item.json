So it is a great challenge asking scientists to assume responsibility for communicating knowledge that is meaningful to people and that at the same time opens up new perspectives. In the conservative tradition of the hard sciences there is nothing meaningful but mathematics and the readings on our instruments. One does not care what it all means, as long as the equations work out and check with observations and readings. This has become a dangerously outdated attitude.",
