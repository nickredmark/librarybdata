By contrast, the periods where the current hegemon is losing its pole position are typically quite chaotic. We are clearly in the process of the decline of American Hegemony. Starting sometime in the ‘Oughts, the American New World Order, that had seemed so stable after the fall of the Soviet Union, started to lose its grip. Now, in 2015, its clear that the BRICs are both interested in and capable of establishing their own agendas on the world stage. In a vacuum this incipient struggle for power would portend danger.

In brief, this challenge is the systemic consequence of exponential technology growth on the ability of individuals to impact the larger society. To put it crisply: not too long from now (say less than 20 years), a relatively small group of individuals (say less than 10) will be able to engineer viral weapons more effective than anything created by the United States or the Soviet Union. Germ warfare, cyber warfare, drones, etc. The list of asymmetric disruptions that are coming onto the threat horizon is long and distinguished. Again, on a standalone basis the empowered individual is a core challenge. But put it in the context of a financial crisis or mass migrations driven by Ecosystem Disruption and you start to see how this thing fits together. We should note for example, that food scarcity (i.e., food prices increasing beyond some threshold level) seems to have been at the core of both the uprising in Egypt and in the Palestinian Territories.",

Within the contemporary political “policing” construct, just how do you deal with the biowarfare threat I identify above? You engage in hyper surveillance of course! As we know, asymmetric information and power/control inevitably leads first to abuse and thence to tyranny, so the cure is as much a poison as the poison.
