We can think of trust as the complex processes of navigating one’s own autonomy and relationality. These are complex dynamics, because they have complex effects upon each other. Increasing capacity for autonomy can either increase or decrease trust, depending upon the relational context; and likewise, increasing relationality can either increase or decrease trust, depending upon the autonomy of the individuals. We resort to properties such as “predictability” and “loyalty” when conditions of trust are low. This leaves little room for the other to exercise their autonomy. Conversely, under conditions of high trust, we allow people to freely exercise their autonomy, without jeopardizing the mutuality of the relationship. Therefore, we can think of trust as a kind of spectrum of possibilities that arise because we are singular-plural beings.",

          "text": "Secondly, as trust can be construed as a spectrum of singular-plurality of being, power can be construed as the fulcrum between relationality and agency. This needs a bit more unpacking. These too, are related in complex ways. If we are strong in mutual relationality, we can exercise a greater agency — we can do more work and accomplish more together. Greater relationality means more alignment of needs and wants, and better coordination of skills and sharing of resources. Combined, this creates greater agency in the collective. However, when people intend to work together, there is always asymmetry between their needs and wants and skills and resources. Because power itself can be formulated by the equation: skills and resources /divided by/ needs and wants, then as people exercise their skills and resources in pursuit of needs and wants collectively, this exacerbates power differentials in the human system.",

          "text": "Thirdly, we can look at collective action through the interplay of autonomy and agency, and the notion of thresholds of action. Autonomy and agency are so closely related, they are often used interchangeably. Here autonomy means being self-authoring and avoiding being driven by unconscious internal forces or being driven by reactivity to external events. It means being able to regulate your own affects, and to attend to your meaningful purpose. Agency is the capacity to do work in the world — to express action in the world in an intended direction. Not surprisingly, autonomy and agency are also related in complex ways. Successful agency tends to build autonomy. Yet, acting in the world is filled with risk and unpredictability, which can undermine one’s sense of autonomy. We act without knowing the consequences of our action, yet inaction is not a possibility, for our inaction itself has unknown consequences. The interplay of autonomy and agency sets a certain threshold for action. Higher risk raises the threshold for action, but it can also function as a condition for increasing autonomy (if the person musters up the nerve to take on the challenge).",

In other words, high trust means lower thresholds for action. Inevitably, however, a team that is tackling bigger challenges, will create hierarchical roles and structures based on distribution of skills that are asymmetric, and needs and wants that move out of alignment. This creates tension and conflict, and decreases trust. A useful analogy here is to think about power asymmetry as a spring. It is a spring that is being stretched between trust and action thresholds. As trust rises, action thresholds lower, and the spring stretches out. But there is a limit to how much tension the spring can hold before it springs back. The system reaches self-organized criticality at the point where the system springs back.

Conventionally, managers resort to sorting out the tensions by fixing functional roles and power status according to skills and merit. This is a good formula for simple or best practice situations where the operational tasks are known and repetitive, and where outcomes are fairly predictable over a longer time-frame. In this case, trust is never fully established, rather it is substituted by predictable roles and fixed power relationships, and trust networks regrow in deviant ways. Also, in this case, action thresholds never fully recover, because the roles and power structures set up complicated dependencies and decision paths that obstruct fast response times and local, agile action. Furthermore, because compensation tends to be based on these fixed roles, people who had been energized and collaborative around project outcomes, become apathetic and turn toward career-focused strategies and political tactics.

We also need to take into account the relative needs of the individuals, which will attract them to one or the other incentive. Bahcall uses a term call “position fit” which represents the balance between skills and needs. The more the skills and needs fit the project and position, the greater the fit. A perfect fit = 100% or 1. In other words, Fit = skills/needs, which is also our metric for individual power.

          "text": "Finally, Bahcall’s research shows that “management span” plays an important part in team coherence. Management span is defined as the number of people (span) that report directly to the management position. If a manager supervises 4 people, the span is 4. If there are 80 people under one management role, the span is 80. Research show that the greater the span, the less promotion gain (G) matters to people. Intuitively we can see why this is so. If you are part of a small team, then each individual perceives a greater chance of success when promotional opportunities arise. Whereas if you are a member of a large group of people occupying the same level, then the manager is not only less available for you to show off your merits, but the candidate pool is also much larger. (In some ways this is counter-intuitive, because the greater the span, the fewer the levels. For example, a company of 100 people and a span of 10 will have ten managerial levels; whereas a company of 100 people with a span of 25 will only have 4. The coherence of a team also depends upon how many levels of management there are. Research also verifies that if there are too many levels, there will be too little skill asymmetry between employee and manager, and hence, the employee will tend to go over the local manager’s head, making it more likely that they will be promoted in the manger’s place. Therefore, coherence varies indirectly with the 1/ (divided) # of levels. We can simplify this because span is 1/ (divided by) # levels, so that leaves us mathematically with S (Squared). With the notion of span and levels, we can see that the amount of “stretch” the spring in our phase system will endure, is directly related to span (Squared)",
