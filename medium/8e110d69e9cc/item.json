The seasonal nature of the business meant that you procured all the materials you would need for the coming season, during the off-season months. All winter we’d buy the masonry and landscape materials that would be installed in the projects that were contracted for the coming year. Clients would pay for their projects on an installment basis — meaning that cash flow was always tied up in inventory at the beginning of the season. But when the season started, that’s when the payroll and subcontractor expenses skyrocketed. This meant that each year we relied on an injection of cash flow from the bank.",

They were helpful to us in the low times, and eager for us to grow in the good times. They extracted their fee, of course. But they participated as partners or stakeholders. Each year our contact from the bank — the “vice president” that serviced our community would take us out to lunch and I would show him the projections for the coming year. We would sign a contract and the loan was established. One year we were waiting for our tables at the restaurant bar and the banker said, as he took out a wad of cash “let me give you some samples from out inventory.” It was a clever joke but something in me changed, bigly.",

They sell you a couch and then after a certain amount of time, you owe the couch back to them. Which means, they are really renting you the couch. But you owe more than the couch back to them. You owe them the couch plus a chair (the interest). But where do you get the chair? Well, that’s got to come from the chair-producers too! Which are, of course, the banks. Now money is a perfect thing to sell in this way, because the couch comes back in exactly the same shape it went out in. There is no wear and tear. The color hasn’t gone out of season. In addition, unlike the couch there is literally NO COST TO THE BANKS TO PRODUCE THEIR INVENTORY. It is produced out of thin air, by fiat. In fact, it is even more perfect than that. The banks produce money at the tax payers’ expense, so they actually pay less than zero to produce their inventory of dollars to rent to you at a profit, after which you have to return everything you buy.",
