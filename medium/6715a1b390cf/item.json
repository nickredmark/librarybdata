How do you find the right balance between empowering, and enabling and asking for the participation of these young people — really involving them, not patronising them, not saying “you sit down and we teach you how to do this because we have thought about it” — but at the same time not oversteering, like so many people now do and say “you solve it, you are our hope, this generation is going to solve it”. That is misunderstanding of human development. They are kids. They do need some growing and experience and they need mentorship. They need companionship from the elders.",
