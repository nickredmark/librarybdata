They are exquisitely adapted to their old media landscape but will die off quickly when the ice starts to melt. They know how to influence public perception through spin and attention — who gets on Fox News, what does the New York Times say (or not say) about someone? They know how to raise huge war chests — to spend mostly on TV ads. An estimated $4.4 Billion will be spent on TV ads in the 2016 Presidential election, out of a total of $5 Billion. Turn off the TV and almost all of that money, power and influence is wasted. Talk about leverage.",
