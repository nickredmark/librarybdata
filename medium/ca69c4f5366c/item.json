Without doubt it is part of our nature as living beings that our conscious self-awareness remains largely in the background so that our enjoyment of good health is constantly concealed from us. Yet despite its hidden character health none the less manifests itself in a general feeling of well-being. It shows itself above all where such a feeling of well-being means we are open to new things, ready to embark on new enterprises and, forgetful of ourselves, scarcely notice the demands and strains which are put on us.

Some complete the course, with ups and downs, but successfully and — what a glorious exhilarating experience it has been, whatever the sadness that it has ended.” Antonovsky believed this metaphor to be “useful in conveying the flavour of the salutogenic image of life” (Antonovsky, 1987, p.89).

The holistic perspective recognizes the fundamental interconnectedness of nature and culture. From this point of view all design affects human and planetary health, therefore we are better advised to make the contribution to positive health an integral intention behind all efforts of design.",
