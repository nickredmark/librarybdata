          "text": "Education for social and ecological literacy will be an important catalyst in the process of creating a culture of sustainability. The challenges of climate change, approaching peak oil, and non-renewable resource depletion are creating the need for an education that empowers citizens through knowledge and skills which enable them to actively participate in the design and creation of sustainable communities and bioregions. This paper will demonstrate how educational alliances between the Findhorn Foundation College, the Global Ecovillage Network, Gaia Education, Living Routes, and various universities in the UK and USA are beginning to address the urgent need for education for a sustainable future. The structure and content of the UNITAR endorsed Ecovillage Design Education (EDE) curriculum and the Findhorn Community Semester (FCS) will be reviewed. The EDE curriculum forms the basis of intensive training courses that are being offered on five continents as an official contribution to the United Nations Decade for Education for Sustainable Development (UNDESD 2005–2014). The global and local educational alliances explored in this paper link Scottish, UK, and international universities with non-governmental organizations, engaged citizens, educational charities, and sustainable community projects on five continents. The author will report on the progress of an attempt to create innovative new masters programmes in integrated sustainable community and ecovillage design through collaboration between the Findhorn Community College, Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) Moray, and various Scottish universities and UK institutions. Some of the existing precedence for alliances between educational charities focussed on sustainable development and universities will be reviewed in this context.",

Peter Buckley, co-founder of the Centre for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, California believes that “at the heart, the ecological problems we face are problems of values. Children are born with a sense of wonder and affinity to nature. Properly cultivated, these values can mature into ecological literacy, and eventually into sustainable patterns of living (in Barlow, 2004, p.7).",

The important role of education for sustainability and the need for increased social and ecological literacy as well as a more holistic approach to science has been pointed out by a number of authors (Orr, 1992; Goodwin, 2001; Capra, 2004; Wahl, 2005; Bower, 2001; O’ Sullivan, 1999; Sterling, 2001; and Wheeler et al., 2000).",

Yet it has to go deeper than that, offering a profoundly transformative experience that raises awareness, shifts paradigms and worldviews, and changes value systems, thereby causing and sustaining a change in lifestyle.",

Mare argues: “The intellectual discipline that most closely accommodates the synthesis of biology and human settlements … is ‘Ecovillage Design’”(p.5). Expanding on the metaphorical design analogy, he proposes that sustainable human settlements could be regarded as “organs in a bioregional body” itself part of a global network (p.41), and suggests that “human systems must be modelled upon biological systems in order to be sustainable” (p.42).",

Our students went on to win prizes with what they learned at Findhorn and all three years of the masters were marked by the same feedback: how the time at Findhorn was the most transformative part of the whole programme and helped students to reorientate their professional practice towards a more holistic approach committed to making a positive difference.
