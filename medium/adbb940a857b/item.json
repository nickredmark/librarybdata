It was like stepping out of the conceptual prison of my measured, quantified and reduced reality into the endless and boundless stream of becoming, leaving the mental crutches of linearity as a conceptual framework behind. I realized my participation in this awe inspiringly beautiful holistic reality. ‘Time’, as I had known it, imploded into the eternal now. As I, for the first time, became open to the possibility of non-linear causality, all my remaining thought-forms based on Reductionist, linear, logical reasoning were challenged in that eternal instant. Initially, there was the exhilarating, yet at the same time frightening feeling of momentarily loosing every point of reference I had grown accustomed to. Almost instantly the vacuum of value I had been living in was filled, as the beauty and diversity of qualities of the loving, comforting presence of wholeness came rushing in. Waves of sensuous emotions made the core of my being tremble with the joy of participation. The initial panic over having lost all reference and control, gave way to the oceanic feeling of a truly transpersonal experience. What can be acknowledged and communicated through a single glance and within an instance between two people who have shared the blessing of such an experience, will forever challenge our poets attempting to express the inexpressible in words.",

Each of these individual visualisations of colour lasts the full length of a very slow and very deep inward and outward breath cycle.

But suppose one cell of my body were aware that it is part of the whole body. Now that would be something like what happens to the human being when he is aware of God. It’s an awareness of totality of which he is a fragment. It is an intuition. Now you could think of that totality as being the totality of the physical universe, if that’s all you believe in.”122 — Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan",

To participate appropriately, first we have to wake up from ‘Newton’s sleep’. Despite Blake’s prayer: “May God us keep from single vision and from Newton’s sleep” our single-minded focus on reason as the key to the universe has sent us so fast asleep that we seem to be suffering a kind of collective amnesia as we are slowly awakening out of the utopian dream of two-hundred years of ‘man as the master of nature’, of technological manipulation and short-sighted exploitation of Nature. We were so fast asleep that it could make sense to us that we are fundamentally competitive beings in a world of cold, dead matter, and we temporarily lost our ability to understand the deep meaning of being fundamentally co- creative participants in a dynamic living universe.",

The only way to hold them simultaneously is by ‘embracing the paradox’ and trust in the primacy of extra-rational, direct experience of our feelings, because that’s how we experience our relationship to the universe.
