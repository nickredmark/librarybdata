There was agreement that whole systems prototypes would have to demonstrate just what complexity a learning ecosystem could grow to and how weaving diverse stakeholders in education — which, let’s face it, all of society and civilization have a stake in — would enable everyone to learn how to “live for the greater good”. There was also much agreement that such prototypes would best be (bio-)regionally focussed and elegantly adapted to the uniqueness of local culture and ecosystems.",
