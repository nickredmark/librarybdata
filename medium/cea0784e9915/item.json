What if we thought of the organization not as if it existed in space (that is the OPO’s approach with the notion of locations) but as if an organization was a rhythm across time. Here the rhythm would be defined as the creative process, from inception to realization. The rhythmic pattern would be composed of various durations that had unique signatures. In complex systems terms, we can think of the durations as phase-states, and as transitions between them as being determined by some kind of threshold event. Meaning, we cannot have a prior definition of “done” that marks the exit of one state and the beginning of another. Rather, we need to be attuned to the rhythmicity such that we collectively sense when a new phase is emerging as the old phase dispenses. Of course this means that previously defined goals keep moving, and the group must continually surf multiple emergent futures.",
