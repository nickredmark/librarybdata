In the next post, I’ll attempt to map out the parameters of what an optimal (or at least “much better”) sensemaking environment might look like. And then in the third, I’ll begin proposing concrete initiatives that have a reasonable chance of implementing some of this optimal sensemaking environment in the near term.",

Get bit by a neighbor’s dog and you might edit the map “dog” to differentiate between the friendly, loving ball of fluff that you grew up with and this other, much more dangerous thing — thereby updating and “improving” the maps that you use to navigate, parse, evaluate and judge experience.
