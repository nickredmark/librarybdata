He emphasized that sound planning decisions have to be based on a detailed regional survey, which established an inventory of a regionʼs hydrology, geology, flora, fauna, climate and natural topography, as well as its social and economic opportunities and challenges. As such the Geddesian methodology pioneered the bioregional planning approach more than 70 years before the emergence of bioregionalism.",

During that time, Geddes also created a ʻsociological laboratoryʼ and centre for popular regional education in a global context that he called the ʻOutlook Towerʼ, he built Ramsay Gardens on the castle esplanade, took up the chair of Botany at University College, Dundee, and pioneered the first international academic summer school in Europe.",

However, bioregional planning could also be designed to assist in the transition to a bio-based economy.”31",

These are eco-design at the product scale, eco- architecture, construction ecology, community design, industrial design, urban design, and all of them integrate at the scale of bioregional design. In the same compendium Birkeland and Walker explain that ʻbioregional planning starts from the recognition that humans are biological entities and therefore need systems for living that are designed to meet their cultural, economic, and physical needs, but in ways that foster symbiotic relationships with the complex ecological systems of the bioregion.ʼ32 They suggest that in contrast to conventional planning approaches that still ʻtransform natureʼ, bioregional planning integrates nature and culture through transforming society.",

On the one hand, regional cultures are adapting their regional environment to suit human needs, but on the other hand the limits of such adaptations are set by the social and ecological conditions of their particular environment. An adaptation of local cultures to specific ecosystem conditions is therefore the equally important complementary process to the adaptation of ecosystems by their inhabitants. In a healthy system nature and culture are indistinguishable and mutually supportive. This is the crucial lesson humanity has to re-learn at the global and local scale, if the 21st Century is to mark the end of ecological overshoot and a re-integration of humanity into natural processes and limits.",
