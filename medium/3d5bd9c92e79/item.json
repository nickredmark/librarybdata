Because the amounts would be regulated, this means it would control inflation of essential goods and services, and incentivize people to produce them at lower costs. Since large-scale practices such as industrial farming, institutional education and highly regulated health services (read: protected monopolies) are more costly than smart, local distributed systems, eventually there would be a draw down of these approaches, and a catalyzation of alternatives.",
