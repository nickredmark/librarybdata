While the specific meaning of the word design within more narrowly defined particular contexts has not been lost, the design concept on the whole has become more and more encompassing. Expanding far beyond beautification and form giving, or the technical conception and creation of artefacts, processes and organizations, design is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental influence in most human activities. Professor David Orr pertinently illustrates the challenges associated with the expanding awareness of the significance of design:",
