The invention of television, for example, combined with American resonators around a certain promiscuous and uninhibited “low culture” sensibility and a highly competitive, heterogenous local fitness landscape to give rise to a uniquely effective set of cultural artifacts that satisfied (or simulating satisfaction of) several human fundamentals (identity, leisure, creativity, freedom, affection, understanding and participation can all feel satisfied under the soothing massage of television). The result was a 20th Century phenomenon, “American pop Television” that infiltrated nearly all of the world’s cultural milieu.",

At a finite level, this is a question of specificity: what is the best culture now. To answer this question, we must first identify: what is the fitness landscape now. Just as we can identify that a brown bunny is a “more fit” phenotype for the forest than a white bunny, we can surmise that certain cultural dynamics are more likely to be fit than others in a given fitness landscape. For example, the fitness landscape shift driven by the technological innovation of the printing press and the rifle are often considered to have rendered the neo-feudal monarchical cultures of the high renaissance unfit and provided fertile soil for the liberal democratic nation state of the modern era.",

For example, we might note that “authentic creation” that emphasizes imagination and promotes mastery is a cultural “space” that is well suited to the emerging landscape of decentralized media and production; that is resonant with cultural forces in a number of major cultural dynamics and taps into deep human needs. And we might hypothesize that any culture that wants to “win” in the contemporary enviroment would have to empower “authentic creation”.",
