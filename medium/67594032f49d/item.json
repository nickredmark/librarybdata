The key here isn’t to harm McDonalds. Corporations have a thick skin. They don’t like consumer protest, but they can survive. The objective is to annoy McDonalds enough that they turn against Monsanto. The objective is to completely kill Monsanto. To do that, you have to turn their supply chain against them, and so you want to make it as easy as possible for the companies on the List to break ranks with your Target.",
