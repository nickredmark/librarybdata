Please note the little spanner icon on SDG 8. It serves to indicate that this goal in its current formulation is the ‘spanner im the works’ of SDG implemenmtation — unless we redefine ‘Decent work & Economic Growth’ to ‘Good work & Qualitative Growth’ the perpetuation of the growth imperative that is structurally designed into our economic system will continue to sabotage the implementation of all the other goals. We need to redesign our economic and monetary system in order to cross the sustainability bridge towards regeneration!)",
