          "text": "19th Century United States :: In this fascinating study of post offices and technology innovation, we see that government investments in the creation of large-scale infrastructure projects (with corporations having very limited power — chartered for limited duration to achieve particular goals) gave rise to strong economic health for society overall. By providing a reliable system for communication, patent processing, legal enforcement of contracts, and limited liability protection for business activities, the government was able to operate symbiotically with small businesses to strengthen communities and provide a revenue model for taxes to be reinvested in societal infrastructure that grew the economy. It wasn’t until the deregulation of financial markets in the early 20th Century (the Age of Robber Barons) that speculative finance decoupled from the productive economy and caused the market crashes leading to the Great Depression.",

Firstly, there is a long history of human social groups functioning well by having their institutions serve the entire society. This was the case for small-scale hunter-gatherers and for large-scale, rapidly industrializing economies. Secondly, we can see that it was the very logic of Neoliberalism of deregulating and financializing markets that brought an end to both kinds of economy. Destruction of natural environments and displacement from land — in a word, colonialism — have brought an end to many indigenous cultures. And the Great Depression arose the last time this pernicious economic religion took hold of legislatures in an industrial society a century ago.",
