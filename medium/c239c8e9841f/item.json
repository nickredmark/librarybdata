GameB is a new social change phenomenon that’s been springing up on Twitter and Facebook. And if you want to know more about GameB, which we’ll reference from time to time here, I suspect, check it out on GameB. All one word on Facebook. So let’s start with catalysis. What does that mean when you describe yourself as a catalyst? And this goes back to the early GameB days when we talked about and still do constantly thinking about how to lower the activation energy to make something occur. Is that essentially your meaning, your sense of describing yourself as a catalyst?",

But I can catalyze positive change by connecting the right people with each other, paying attention to the quality of the relationships, paying attention to the quality of information that flows between agents in the system.

For me that’s a mem-ceding of the kind of matters that you’ve currently elected into office in your country. To then create a sort of argument for, well, we just need less of us then and how are we going to do that?",

I mean, I’m with you that I think from humanitarian perspective, if no other, we have to use as our starting gate that we’ve got to build a world that can support 10 or 11 billion people by 2100. And as you do point out, fortunately it doesn’t get worse than that because it appears that as economic wellbeing increases and education increases, particularly among women, family sizes are starting to reach replacement level or even below in a lot of the world. So other than Sub-Saharan Africa, which still remains problematic. So looks like we can count on 10 or 11 billion, which is a lot better than trying to deal with 20 billion, which would be one number we’d be talking about if it wasn’t for the fact that birth rates are coming down very rapidly. Another foundational question before we get into some of the more details is a lot of us have heard and talked about sustainability and you make a fairly careful distinction between sustainable and regenerative. Could you perhaps make that distinction for our audience here?",

And what I like about it is, is that it acknowledges that this is a development process and that even the step from business as usual to green doing a little less bad is already better than not making that step. And then there is this issue that in that particular framework, sustainability is defined in a particular way that is maybe unfair to some of the people who’ve been working in the field of sustainability in a really deep way. They might have been thinking of it in regenerative terms, but in this framing that you’re asking me to open up, sustainability is basically understood as the point where we don’t add any more damage to the system, where our actions don’t make things worse.",

They burned off the understory in the woods to let sheep graze in them. They had bad timbering practices. They would either clear cut or just let woods run rampant until they were rotting and falling apart. And over the last 30 years, we have focused on two things. One, returning our pastures to health. And I think we’ve added an inch and a half, two inches, five centimeters of soil by very carefully managing our pastures and our hayfields. And secondly, by managing our timber very carefully, no longer doing clear cuts other than to get rid of monoculture pine that we had.",

I think what would the Aztecs have done if they had bulldozers and nuclear weapons? I suspect they would have done the same bad stuff or worse than we’ve done.",

One of the strongest data signals that came out of evolutionary ecology was the famous lynx snowshoe hare oscillation, where the lynx eats the hares until there aren’t any or hardly any, a very smaller population. And then the lynx die out almost, not quite. And then the snowshoe hares rebound and then the lynx rebounds. So Mr. Lynx and Mr. Hare kind of go at it in a fairly extreme battle and it’s frankly, just the fact that the lynx isn’t quite capable of wiping out the snowshoe hares, it allows the system to persevere.",

And with regard to the snowshoe and hare example, I’m not so sure. I’m an evolutionary biologist originally by training and these… I mean you’re part of the Santa Fe Institute community. If you just build a model on just snowshoe, like two species and then you do the classic predator prey model then you get these kinds of results.

And most of our ecosystems have much more cross dependencies and dynamism. In fact our Santa Fe Institute researcher Jennifer Dunn had done a lot of really good work on the dynamics of food networks and ecosystems including Arctic ones. And one of the things she finds which surprises some people, well she’s not the only one. And I will say she’s not decisive on this, is that there seems to be something like a moderate level of diversity that is best. That at very high diversity food webs become less stable and at very low diversity they become even more unstable. So there’s some kind of homeostatic level of diversity that any given ecosystem seems to evolutionary seek out.",

But I find that it’s a really fascinating thing that I wrestle with a lot of how do you on the one hand sound a voice that we shouldn’t get trapped too much in an entirely analytic, rational, mainly quantities focused and mathematically analyzed scientific mindset? Then no matter how fundamentally useful and necessary that mindset and epistemic approach is. But we also need to acknowledge other ways of knowing that go back to what Young describes as our four ways of knowing and thinking is just one of them. Sensing, feeling and intuiting are the other three.

And it would be epistemic hubris or arrogance to think that even no matter how studied you are in terms of how to building a sustainable regenerative future for humanity, that you could sit down and give a long catalog of answers and solutions that will last forever and that will not have unforeseen side effects. So at that point, I was reminded of this wonderful Einstein quote where he says, “If I had a problem that my life depended upon and I only had one hour to solve it, I would take 55 minutes to get the question right because then I could solve it in five minutes.” So I think that there’s something mistaken in thinking that questions are transitory means to get to better solutions. I think maybe solutions and answers are transitory means to ask better questions.",

And I asked him a question, which is actually about the dimension of spirituality and the sacred in the transition that we now needed to make in order to redesign the human presence on earth within the lifetime of the generations of life today. And he started his answer by saying that before we can meaningfully answer the question, what we have to do and how we might do it in order to sustain our species. And we need to ask a much more difficult question. And that’s the question of why are we worth sustaining? And I kind of on purpose leave my answer to that question somewhat vague throughout the book. I alluded many times of why I believe we’re worth sustaining.",

And, but I do feel that the levels of reflective consciousness that we have with the capability of learning from the past and to some extent possibly even applying that learning to navigate our path into the future, there’s something beautiful about the way that we’ve written poetry and created art to express our love for other beings, human and not non-human days.

And that in itself to not kill that story in its immature juvenile stage where we’re still at as a species. And to actually make that jump in our awareness of that participatory mystique and magic that we’re part of, to really become conscious participants in that process and try to be of healing and regenerative influence on it.

There is no sign so far of any life anywhere in this amazing universe of ours. So I put forth the why that humanity’s mission is to bring the universe to life and it is within our ability to do so.

I think that we might be in a Trump track of an explanatory model that we’ve just repeated for too long. That is this sort of coming out of dead matter. It actually seems to me more parsimonious to say everything is somewhat conscious and everything is somewhat alive at different levels of complexity than to say suddenly ex nihilo life appears suddenly ex nihilo consciousness appears.

So I think we got to be very careful when we start thinking about such things and that we know exactly what we’re saying because it is unfortunately an attractor for humans. Humans love kind of blousy stuff, right? Hence the prevalence of religions and all that sort of stuff. They love a pie in the sky. And so I think we’ve got to be very careful when we talk about these things to put bounds around them. What is actually known, what theories might support panpsychism.

And then there’s the visionary type, which is the third horizon perspective that is saying, no, no, no, we need to fundamentally redesign our economic system and we need a shift in consciousness and all this kind of stuff. And then very often you find that arguments get polarized between the visionary and the kind of pragmatic management perspective.

So what I’m talking about with the shift from scarcity mindset to abundance mindset is very much linked to the shift from the story of separation to the story of into being. It is the understanding that the most enlightened way I can work for myself interest is to actually optimize the whole system for everyone. And since I’m part of that, that will come back to me. Yeah, I’ll leave it at that.",

And there’s a lot of argument amongst the complexity folks, whether that’s necessary or it’s just something that happened and I’m not qualified to have an opinion there. Well at least not qualified to have a well-founded opinion. I have an opinion, which is yes, there is a force that seems to be pushing us towards more complexity. What that is, I don’t know. On the other hand, in terms of actually evolving or growing a social operating system, the actual quality of life of the typical human also has to be taken into consideration. If a human has to go back to what has been the history of humans since the invention of agriculture, which is backbreaking work, living on the edge of starvation and have 50% of your kids die before they’re five years old.",

And I do think we have to think about all 10 billion of them. At some point they’re all going to want approximately the same quality of life and I think that’s a really hard part of this problem. How do we build to a level, frankly probably build down from the western level of consumption, but build up from the very poor country levels of consumption.

And so they actually, just like many Native American tribes in North America didn’t have this, what you were just painting this backbreaking hard sluggary of work.

I didn’t own the massive, beautiful area that I walked through and felt a sense of collective ownership and responsibility and gratitude for.

By the way, I like your term ecosystem functions rather than ecosystem services. And so when I come around to it is we need some forms of social signaling. Because making thing is as hard.

And the reason I did that was so that I could actually dabble in whole chain this year. And while I’m 100% with you on their philosophy, it’s the best I’ve ever seen. I do have some skepticism on some of the fairly serious technical details and the only way to find out if my sort of sense is right or wrong is actually just jump in and do it. So I’m going to hack together some hollow chain stuff probably by mid-year and then I’ll have a deeper view. I hope it’s good. I hope it’s good or it could be made to be good because philosophically I’ve seen nothing.",

It is whether we are authentically spiritual in the sense that you can make soccer your religion, you can make environmentalism your religion and none of them are very good ones.

Either you take the pathway of ecology and if you really understand the complexity and the interconnections and the patterns of which in which the whole in the part relate through an ecological understanding.

So for me, spirituality, I agree that it can get really wooly and fuzzy and it can be an S word that makes things complicated.

This tendency that people want to go to, “Oh there’s a cosmic consciousness of which we’re all a part.” Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. There is no damn evidence.

Well even using a scientific entry point here, if everything is fundamentally interconnected through non-local quantum connections then every state change in me is also a state change in the known universe.

Because I like to point out to people in the contest between metaphysical speculation and objective reality, the metaphysicians have always had it wrong. Thor does not cause thunder nor the sun doesn’t go around the earth. Nor the earth isn’t 6,000 years old. Anytime the two have come together, objective measurements of reality have always with one or two minor exceptions that you can put down to chance, defeated metaphysical speculation. So my view is enjoy one subjective, fully embodied being, but then don’t leap from there to making metaphysical speculations about the physical world.",

And that it’s basically a bunch of people agreeing to a certain methodology, a certain epistemology and then working within that to reproduce certain outcomes to certain experiments. And that’s verifiable. And that’s what I think you’re referring to as objective, but that there is actually a participatory agency of consciousness in everything that we bring forth. That perception isn’t a process of opening the eyes and the world just comes in and the world’s out there. But it is every act of perception has an act of conception in it. And if we pay attention to the seer, the role of the seer in the way we access reality, then we can allow for that epistemological pluralism a little bit more.

And the lines got drawn very firmly and the factions went to war. And that was one of a couple of reasons why the original GameB 1.0 exploded into dust at the end of 2013. Fortunately we were smart. We said we’re going to go into spore mode here. Everyone just take what wherever they’re at with GameB, go out in the world and do your thing. Maybe someday the spores will regenerate.

I think more and more people in our world are seeing it, which is that there are a few people who can change themselves despite the institutions they’re embedded in. But those few people are small. One or 2% may be the classic early adopters are maniac innovators in the technology space or consumer product space. But most humans really aren’t able to make much of a deep change in themselves unless they’re reinforced by appropriate social signals. So the job is for these early people to change themselves enough to be able to build some institutions that work for them, but then emanate signals such that they start to enable other people to change.",

And one thing that I’ve been working with a lot in my explorations of all of this is this idea of scale linking design and the scales of design from kind of products to the material science. What do we make stuff out of and what energy do we use? But then onto products and architecture, community planning, industrial ecology, urban planning, bioregional planning and then the international networks of collaboration and knowledge exchange that enable us to coordinate bioregional reinhabitation across the globe in solidarity. For me, if you look at a map of the globe and you look at the straight lines of many of the country’s borders, you can very clearly see how they were drawn by the rulers of some normally a colonial power.",

And that the patterns of rematching might just be more biophysical patterns, like a watershed, like a bioregion. And that at that scale we can more easily both evolve the personal and the institutional side of this conversation that you opened. Because we’re reinventing like Bucky Fuller quote again, don’t fight the existing system. Build an alternative system that makes the old system obsolete.

But recently I’ve seen a lot of organizations kind of converge on that the locus of focus for this work is at the bioregional scale and whether it’s the regenerative communities network that spun out of the capital Institute or whether it’s the people working on the Planetary Health Alliance and they all seem to agree that if we want to create GameB, the place to do the experimenting and the playing is a global focus that centers around the bioregion region.

But that’s why I moved to Majorca eight years ago, almost 10 years ago and I actually, because I, after spending a good 15, 20 years of my life working with those folks that like to experiment, built the alternative system at the community scale.

In order to not just slow down global warming but eventually reverse global warming to the point that we get back to more closely to 250 parts per million like we were before the industrial revolution. But even if we don’t get that in re-regionalizing our patterns of production and consumption, we also built the resilience towards a climate disruptive world or a virally disrupted world or all I mean the black swan is a hard and fast. There are plenty of things that could come our way that would make things difficult. But if we build the redundance at the bioregional scale, we have a better chance of navigating that future.",
