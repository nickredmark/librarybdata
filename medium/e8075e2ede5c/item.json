The result is a graph that can be used to derive a view of “the whole League” but at the same time captures the real clusters and relationships between and among the Members. For example, the current Bitcoin block size debate might show up revealing that both Gavin Andresen and Gregory Maxwell have significant Credibility within the League, but that they each represent different sub-communities within the Bitcoin sub-set of the League.)",
