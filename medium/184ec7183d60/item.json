Aspects of holistic thinking have been present in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance philosophies and religions.

The stage is now being set for important unifications of philosophy, conceptual frameworks, and knowledge that will provide the basis for a new holistic practical philosophy. — Burrows et al., 1991, p.359",

As someone whose academic career started with biology, behaviour, and cognitive science, I have been surprised, since I started my research in design, by the increasing tendency of research in art and design to adopt a very analytical and reductionist stance that is almost exclusively materialistically and economically motivated. Artistic practice may require imagination, but too often it follows trends and fashions more than being truly original.",

The theory informing the natural design movement (see chapter 3) is based on a holistic and participatory worldview and explores how this worldview would inform practical sustainable design solutions.

He believed that “the analytical scientific outlook is giving place to the synthetic and philosophical,” since “it has become clear that each science by itself is bound, by the nature of its methods, to be partial and abstract, fishing in the sea of reality with its own particular kind of net, and necessarily missing much that is there.” Geddes described and called for a “compulsory retreat from an extreme mechanistic position,” and describes the universe as “a vibrant web of inter-relations”.",

Relationships and interactions are primary aspects of holism. They are also primary aspects of design, meaning, life and spirituality. William Bloom writes:",
