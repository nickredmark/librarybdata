Along with the name of Gaia, another important lesson is emerging from the collective subconscious of humanity: everything in the universe is fundamentally interrelated and interconnected. The separation between humanity and nature is a result of the dogmatic dualism characteristic of our scientific worldview.",

In 2002, he received a Masters in Holistic Science from Schumacher College and the Department of Environmental Science of the University of Plymouth. During his time at Schumacher College, Daniel had the opportunity of meeting James Lovelock personally and to study Gaia theory with Stephan Harding, one of Lovelock’s collaborators. Daniel gained his PhD at the Centre for the Study of Natural Design of the University of Dundee. He lived at the Findhorn ecovillage between 2007 and 2010 and worked in academic outreach and programme development for the Findhorn Foundation College. Since 2011 Daniel lives on the island of Mallorca and works locally and internationally as an educator, activist, and consultant in transformative innovation and whole systems design for sustainability. In 2016 Daniel published Designing Regenerative Cultures with Triarchy Press in the UK. The book has already reached international acclaim.]",
