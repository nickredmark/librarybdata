My conflation of anti-science views is intentional. All evidence points to the reality that inequality went up and poverty increased as the economy grew larger in the last 40 years. The belief that more of this kind of unequal growth — 95 cents of every dollar going to the already well-off since the financial collapse of 2008 — will somehow bring poverty to an end belongs in the same place as other childish fantasies. It is no more real than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny.",

Later came the informal trade networks of nomadic herdspeople, followed by the rise of agrarian city states with distinct social pyramids where strong man dictators ruled with an iron fist. This was followed by the rise of empires and dynastic orders — another form of social hierarchy where the masses remained poor and wealth was syphoned to the top.",
