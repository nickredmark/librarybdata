This is a pretty tactical assessment and should make sense and be useful to anyone. I’ll get to the deep point last — and will be going way out there in an effort to grasp “what is really going on”.

It is intrinsically dissonant with the kind of top-down, slow, controlled, synchronized approach of the old media.
