This case report describes three educational tools and a workshop developed by Gaia Education to facilitate such conversations. The SDG Flashcards, the SDG Project Canvas, and the SDG Multipliers Handbook are used in concert to support the Training of Multipliers Workshops. In partnership with the Global Action Programme (GAP) of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), this collection of resources has been translated into six languages, and trainings have been offered in 16 countries onfive continents. The purpose of this collection of resources is to rapidly cultivate multipliers — people who are able to facilitate local and regional conversations about how implementation of the SDGs can be sensitive to and informed by the biocultural uniqueness of place. This case report concludes with a discussion of the trainings held, participant feedback, and opportunities and strategies for improving the resources.",

The purpose of this exercise is to give small groups an opportunity to cocreate a coherent narrative and a more de- tailed sketch of how their chosen project might be designed and implemented in practice. The groups explore together who the key partners need to be and what activities would make their project a success. They list resources required and articulate the project’s Theory of Change. Furthermore, the Project Canvas invites exploration of how to ensure widespread participation, what key policies might help garner support from local authorities, who will be the primary beneficiaries of the project (and who might be impacted adversely by it), as well as details on cost, other resources, and how to fund the project (see Figure 2).",

While Gaia Education recommends attending a one-day or half-day Training of Multipliers Workshop, which walks participants through the materials and exercises, prior to stepping into the facilitators role, the Handbook does offer enough minute-by-minute detail to enable experienced trainers and facilitators to run a workshop simply by following the steps provided.
