Arguably ‘nature’ is an abstract noun and its meaning is culturally and socially influenced, but I understand nature as the larger all containing process that enables us to have our misunderstandings in the first place. While in such a view of nature nothing falls without this process, it nevertheless remains possible for designed artefacts and processes to either support or disrupt the overall evolution of natural process. The assumption is made that the process from which the ‘subsystems’ biosphere and humanity emerged is evolving higher levels of complexity, diversity, and interdependence or symbiosis. The dynamic stability, or health of the biosphere and its sub-systems depends on the continuation of this evolutionary tendency.",

My intent is not to reinforce mechanistic metaphors where systems describe wholes that are purely the sum of their parts and their study is aimed at increasing our ability to better predict and control these systems. The term system is used here in the context of complexity. Complex dynamic systems or processes defy control and prediction. The characteristics of the whole are understood as emergent properties that depend on the complex dynamics of interaction and relationship among the parts. A ‘complex dynamic system’ is always recognized to be more than simply the sum of its parts. All complex dynamic systems are in a participatory relationship with the larger processes that contain them.",

Human action is design’ (Glanville, 1997 translated from Jonas 2001). Design should not be considered one of many specialized fields of human endeavour; rather, design can be understood as the integrative process or activity that connects human actions and attitudes to their material and cultural expression in form of artefacts, institutions, and processes.",

In 1999, Munich Reinsurance, the largest reinsurance company in the world, published an alarming report that demonstrated the exponential increase in the number and severity of natural catastrophes that occurred during the course of the 20th century. The report left no doubt that climate change and environmental degradation was due to human activity and called for an immediate response in all sectors of society (Münchner Rück, 1999).",

An important aspect of ecological literacy is to make the fundamental unpredictability and uncontrollability of natural process and all other complex systems more intelligible. Eco-literacy will not always provide us with statistically significant predictions of the outcomes of our actions. Its lessons take us beyond the certainty of rational analysis and linear cause and effect into the chaotic and complex dynamics of natural systems. Islands of safe unpredictability are built by considering the appropriate spatial and temporal scale for our actions and through ‘verneztes Denken’ that integrates what we do know in the humble awareness of what we can’t know.",

He traces the ethical implications of various positions from egocentrism, via anthropocentrism and biocentrism to cosmocentrism. In Löbach’s opinion all designers need to confront these various ethical positions and their corresponding value systems, since such a confrontation provides the basis for orienting their own actions and allows them to assume and defend responsible positions through their own arguments and creative actions (Löbach, 1995).",

This requires human empathy to extend beyond our corporal shell. The ethical domain must be reframed from the anthropocentric to the biocentric”. Elliot points out that: “empathy is an important form of knowing, especially as it pertains to the aesthetic subject” (Elliott, 2004, p.5).",

Since the path of learning about appropriate participation that embodies sustainability has to be walked by the vast majority of the human population in order to bring about the desired result of a sustainable future, I agree with Kurt in that “an aesthetics of sustainability will always be an aesthetics of participation as well — or will have to become one” (Kurt, 2004, p.239).

In a culture that classifies the world through quantification and statistical significance, where economic gain is the main measure of success, qualitative aspects and relationships can easily be neglected. Our environmental, social and cultural problems are largely the result of a neglect of qualitative social and ecological value in favour of purely quantitative economic value. The vastly oversimplified map that reductionistic and mechanistic science has painted of the world does not sufficiently describe the complexity and interdependence within the system in which we participate. It overemphasizes the role of competition in evolution through its focus on separate individuals. At the level of the whole, nature is held together by cooperation and symbiosis.",

And this is the presence of health”(McHarg, 1970). McHarg’s definition of ‘design with nature’ was a practice of design that increases interconnectedness, diversity, fitness, complexity and health throughout the system as a whole. To McHarg this system is nature and culture. Culture is the most rapidly adaptable means to re-establish a creative fit between humanity and nature. Biological adaptations to a changing environment take a lot longer to evolve than cultural adaptations! McHarg foresaw the shift from a culture that is intent on controling and exploiting nature, to a culture of appropriate participation in the restoration of the earth and the health of nature (see McHarg, 1996).",

This is the metaphorical understanding of the health of a complex dynamic system. This is an idea that few of us will ever be able to conceptualise in detail, but I think that many of us are beginning to sense in terms of aesthetic pattern. The relative health of a landscape, an organism, the health of a system, even the health of a technological construct, is a material problem of diverse complexity. … The perception of health is a relative term, it requires intimate knowledge over a period of time and a caring critical attention. In turn, a lack of health can be described in terms of emergent dominant systems that mitigate the constraint of diversity. Diversity is healthy expression and perception is an integrative, dialogic concept. This concept departs from the autonomous object of classical aesthetics, defined as unity, regularity, simplicity, proportion, balance, measure and definiteness. Within the aesthetic perception of diversity lies systemic relationship, dynamism, complexity, symbiosis, contradiction to measurement and indefinite and procreative vitality. I believe that an aesthetic of diversity is emergent but not yet cogent. It is a theoretical view with an experiential basis that must be identified and pursued by many. It will not be captured in terms of a singular theory, a definite practice or primary authorship.” — Timothy Collins, 2004, p. 172).",

In general, it is a good habit to embrace paradoxes and seeming contradictions as an indication of good holistic thinking rather than something to be avoided. They indicate a more comprehensive and integrative understanding and invite us to go deeper. Donella Meadows proposed that our ability to comprehend and participate in a complex system increases significantly once we can move between paradigms (Meadows, 1997).

This requires a maintenance and restoration of diversity within the system (see Gunderson & Holling, 2002). Design will have to learn from and mimic nature’s economy of zero waste, renewable resource use and energy sources. An ecological ethic, together with an aesthetic of health will assure that designs are considered within their ecological, cultural and social context, and are benign or health generating rather than disruptive to natural process.",
