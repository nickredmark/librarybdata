          "text": "This process never ends. The universe unfolds and changes, often (usually?) in surprising ways. Therefore, the process of ecosystem health management must become a process whereby we learn from our experience and respond and adapt to the unexpected, reassessing complaints, rethinking the shapes of the ultimate patients, testing different responses. We need good indicators of sustainability and health that not only reflect our best scientific understanding of what is necessary to survive, but also our deepest intuitive sense of what is good and important to survive well. … There is an underlying assumption … Ecosystem approaches to health requires that — with all our faults and betrayals and stupidity and brilliance and humility — we need somehow to trust each other. We do not seek blind trust. Nor do we need to trust each other about everything. We know each other too well for that anyway. We need to trust each other to deal honourably in our public spaces — in the water, the air, the landscape, the way a bird trusts that the branch it lands on will not break, or a fish trusts that water will provide it with oxygen. This is the kind of democratic trust, where we share responsibilities, rights, knowledge and activities, but where we also put into place ‘quality control’ rules, so we can check up on each other. We have responsibilities not just to work collectively and think systemically, but to be sceptical of everything we do, even as we trust. This is not an easy road, but one, I would think, well worth taking. Even if the world ends — which it will someday in any case — we still want to be able to hold our heads up high with dignity as a species, and be able to say we have lived not only long, but well (Waltner-Toews, 2004, p.128).",
