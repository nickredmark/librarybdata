Accordingly, following my usual policy of intellectual recklessness, I dove deep and swam around for a while.

This tells us that at the very least he is not ignorant of climate science.

It is only our understanding that feels satisfied with a good story. This is particularly true in these waning years of broadcast media which has had such a profound effect on our understanding. I am going to construct a narrative. It is absolutely certainly not the full story. But it is an honest exploration of what might follow from these three influences. And a good faith effort to view the world through this lens. What follows is dark. If you find that unpalatable, read no further.",

Since this is broadly true of everyone else, the net result is that after ten generations, your genes show up in the population at roughly the same rate as they do right now.
