Wilson’s definition quoted above (Orr, 1993, p.416). Orr warns:",

Third, was a shift of attention from the sensuous qualities of the living world to the hard data of quantifiable and measurable units of purely material or economic value. “Fourth, we needed a reason to join power, cash, and knowledge in order to transform the world into more useful forms. Francis Bacon provided the logic; the evolution of government funded research did the rest.” The fifth step was the creation of a “philosophy of improvement” which was provided by the “ideology of perpetual economic growth”; and the sixth requirement for the cultural spread of biophobia was “the sophisticated cultivation of dissatisfaction which could be converted into mass consumption” (Orr, 1993, pp.417–418).",

We have good reason to believe that human intelligences could not have evolved in a lunar landscape devoid of biological diversity. And we have good reason to believe that the sense of awe toward the creation had a great deal to do with the origin of language and why early hominids wanted to talk, sing, and write poetry in the first place. Elemental things like flowing water, wind, trees, clouds, rain, mist, mountains, landscape, animals, changing seasons, the night sky, and the mysteries of the life cycle gave birth to thought and language. They continue to do so, but perhaps less exuberantly than they once did. For this reason I think it is impossible to unravel natural diversity without undermining human intelligence as well. Can we save the world and anything like the human self from the violence we have unleashed without biophilia and reverence for creation (Orr, 1993, pp.425–426)?",

The unbreakable bond of relatedness that makes of the whole a universe becomes increasingly apparent to scientific observation, although this bond subsequently escapes scientific formulation or understanding. In virtue of this relatedness, everything is intimately present to everything else in the universe. Nothing is completely itself without everything else. This relationship is both spatial and temporal. However distant in space or time, the bond of unity is functionally there. The universe is a communion and a community. We ourselves are the communion becoming conscious of itself (Berry, 1988, p.91).",

Bioregionalism presents an alternative to fragmentation by suggesting the construction of an ecological identity…, of orbits and connections that integrate mind and landscape, self and ecosystem, psyche and planet, without worrying about the paths not taken, but focusing instead on the task at hand — cultivating mindfulness about human/nature relationships in the service of both self-realization and community health (Thomashow, 1999, p.124).",
