Coherence refers to a particular dispositional state of a team, where the complex feed loops between trust, power and action thresholds are optimized for flow (see A Source Code for Team Flow). The degree of power asymmetry in the system is a crucial function of team flow. Power asymmetry in turn is a function of information flows and can be regulated by designing resilience through sensemaking up-hierarchies.",

Unlike AI, and similar to all other living agents, human learning is not rule-bound, but based on protocols and affordances. The dance of protocols-and-affordances is what we call “experience” in the human endeavor. This is a feature that educators consistently fail to recognize, and is a major reason why machines seem to be out-performing people on “intelligence” since we have slowly but surely come to define learning as a rule-bound function.",

This is the “up-cycle” in the sensemaking up-hierarchy. In turn, these larger wholes, when redistributed “down” in the network, compose new contexts for local action. This is the “sensemaking” aspect of the sensemaking up-hierarchy. An adequate design will compensate for the need for human systems to gate-away information to avoid overload, because the function of global update is not so much that every node holds every data point (that is true for AI, because it lacks sensemaking ability), but for every agent to be working in an updated context. As complexity increases, contexts continuously shift. Hence, there is no doubt that AI must be a reliable partner in designing and operating sensemaking up-hierarhcies. But this partnership should be able to out-perform strictly rule-bound AI systems, in the context of what matters most to people, and the particularly human challenges we face on our planet today.",
