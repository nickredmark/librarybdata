Bortoft explains: “Far from there being direct access to facts by sense perception alone, there is actually a nonsensory factor in every fact. Far from being idea-less, there is an organizing idea in every act of cognitive perception” (Bortoft, 1996, p.145).",

Bortoft emphasizes that this way of seeing “certainly gives us power over nature, but it has the effect of separating us from nature. We begin to experience ourselves as being separate and essentially different from nature, while nature in turn begins to seem lifeless and empty” (Bortoft, 1996, p.174).",

The internalization of our experience of the closed boundaries of such bodies leads to a way of thinking which naturally emphasizes distinction and separation. Since the fundamental characteristic of the world of solid bodies is externality — i.e., everything is external to everything else — then this way of thinking is necessarily analytical. For the same reason it is also necessarily sequential and linear, proceeding from one element to another in a piecemeal fashion — the principle of mechanical causality is a typical way of thinking in this analytical mode of consciousness. Henri Bergson noticed the affinity between logical relations with concepts and spatial relations with solid bodies, and he concluded that “our logic hardly does more than express the most general relations among solids.” The principles of logic — identity (A is A), noncontradiction (not at the same time A and not-A), and excluded middle (either A or not A) — are extrapolations from these limited circumstances which are assumed to hold universally. For this reason the mode of consciousness associated with logical thinking is necessarily analytical.”",

By contrast, this mode is nonlinear, simultaneous, intuitive instead of verbal-intellectual, and concerned more with relationships than with the discrete elements that are related. It is important to realize that this mode of consciousness is a way of seeing, and as such it can only be experienced in its own terms. In particular, it cannot be understood by the verbal-intellectual mind because this functions in the analytical mode of consciousness, for which it is not possible to appreciate adequately what it means to say that a relationship can be experienced as something real in itself. In an analytical mode of consciousness it is the elements which are related that stand out in experience, compared with which the relationship is but a shadowy abstraction. The experience of a relationship as such is only possible through a transformation from a piecemeal way of thought to a simultaneous perception of the whole. Such a transformation amounts to a restructuring of consciousness itself. … Whereas we imagine movement and change analytically, as if the process really consisted of a linear sequence of instantaneously stationary states (like a sequence of snapshots), when movement and change are experienced holistically, they are experienced as a whole. The elements which are experienced simultaneously in this mode are thus dynamically related to each other, and this dynamical simultaneity replaces the static simultaneity of the analytical mode.”",

Contemplative meditation or mindfulness is a methodology for shifting into a holistic mode of consciousness (Bortoft, 1996, p.65). In a holistic mode of consciousness the mind begins to function intuitively instead of intellectually. Bortoft uses Ornstein’s definition of intuition as “knowledge without recourse to inference”, which is linked to a “simultaneous perception of the whole.” Robert E. Ornstein connected “the intuitive mind with the holistic mode of consciousness — as the intellectual mind is linked with the analytical mode (Bortoft, 1996, p.67).",

Just as it seems so evident to us that everything we see about us is “just there,” i.e., object instead of meaning, and that cognitive perception is just sense perception. We are accustomed to thinking of mind as if it were inside us — “in our heads.” But it is the other way around. We live within a dimension of mind which is for the most part, as invisible to us as the air we breathe. We usually only discover it when there is a breakdown.”",
