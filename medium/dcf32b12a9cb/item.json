Through this book we come to realise deeply that there is a way out of the madness of our current societal systems in which so many people and non-human species have become trapped. I have been with this book for more than a year now, and it has taken me a year to integrate all that is shared here before I could write this review. The information shared here is so rich and vital, and it requires re-reading again and again. I have experienced this book as a community of practice as Daniel Wahl takes us with him into the conversations, narratives, and wonderful initiatives of the “Regeneration Movement”.",

We are in the emergence for another renaissance period. This time it will be remembered as the time of the Regeneration Rising, as we are now standing on the graveyard of a more sinister war. This war has developed as a silent invader from within, which has been destroying the essential fabric and vital balancing systems of our ecological interdependencies. This invader cannot be identified as a specific group of people to whom we declare war. This invader is born from the shadows of our own ignorance and greed. This war can, therefore, not be fought with weapons of destruction and intimidation. This war can only be fought by realising fundamentally our interbeingness and unity within the family of life as a whole. The weapons that are needed now are those of the Shambhala Warriors, which are the weapons of Compassion and Insight. It is said that the Shambhala Warriors will rise when the survival of every sentient being is at risk.",
