There is no “self” to be found in that, and yet oddly enough, there is. Part of you is out there waiting to come into you, and another part of you is behind you, and the “just this” of the ever-present moment holds all the transitory little selves in its mirror. The Avatamsaka (“Flower Wreth”) jewelled-net-interpenetration-ecological-systems-emptiness- consciousness tells us, no self-realization, without the Whole Self, and the whole self is the whole thing.”166",

Since September 11th, the issue of security has become a top priority, particularly in those countries who are consuming the world’s resources drastically above the rate that could be regarded as an equal share and certainly well above what may be regarded as sustainable resource use. Birkeland argues that through “smart investment in eco-technologies” a country could increase its national security by “reducing reliance on external sources of water, oil and minerals that are presently secured by aggressive corporate or military strategies. Eco-investment could also increase personal security in poorer nations, and reduce the pressure on the world’s poor to have more children as a form of old age insurance.”189",
