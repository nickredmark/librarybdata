Just as email protocol has allowed message sending to become programmable, blockchain tech allows value and property ownership to be programmable. Tech companies are most certainly likely to build on this ability, producing AI that buy, sell and own digital and sometimes physical property. The AI won’t just act on behalf of its creator, it will actually earn money — perhaps from other AIs — and accumulate its own resources.",

Suppose China can make both phones and cars cheaper than the US. Does that mean China should produce both? Not necessarily. Let’s suppose that the US is much more efficient at producing cars than it is at producing phones. Conversely let’s say that China is better at producing phones rather than cars. If this is the case, it’s best if each country focuses on what its best at and trades for the other product. Specifically, China should focus on phones and the US should focus on cars, even if China could produce more cars than the US if it tried. Then if the US needs phones it should send some cars to China in return for phones. If you want a moment to really wrap your head around the concept, see this video. It applies to humans as well as embodied in the maxim “don’t compare yourself to others; rather focus on your strengths.”",

Before the industrial revolution, the rich classes historically had a lower class of slaves or serfs working to secure their comfort so that they could focus on the finer things in life. With the advent of industrial capitalism, machines began to augment labour to such an extent that a new middle class emerged of people who could produce so much that they too could experience leisure and fine living, albeit on weekends and after work only. The progress of technology has advanced living standards so much that middle class people of today would likely consider living like King Louis XIV to be too barbaric and rough to tolerate for long periods of time. Some people believe that the progress of technology will increase to the point where labour isn’t saved but eliminated entirely, ushering in an era of “post-scarcity”. So is it even technically or economically possible for this to happen? There is only one mechanism that I can identify that would enable this and it flows through the channel of declining hardware costs.",

          "text": "The processing power of CPUs has since the 1970s been increasing at an exponential rate. Continued at a 2 year doubling, there’s no reason computers won’t be able to do anything by the end of the century. However, in recent years, Moore’s Law has ground to a crawl, prompting fears of a new normal plane of processing that software developers will have to work around to achieve more powerful applications. Nonetheless, parallel innovations such as quantum computing potentially offer to pick up the baton when silicon transistors left off. If storage and processing costs continue to plummet, the advent of AI that isn’t strictly for financial purposes might become more likely. We already see this with open source software projects such as Vue that are backed by nothing but donations. In this super low cost world, an AI might come to fruition that has similar abilities to the ones outlined above that were funded by Silicon Valley but which uses some of its hard earned cryptocurrency to establish a basic income guarantee. Imagine a software writing AI that earns money by completing every job on freelance sites and then distributes the proceeds to every person in Africa. Companies outsourcing to this super AI could even use this as a marketing advantage claiming that use of their services indirectly benefits the worlds’ poor. Consumers could then pressure companies to outsource to the kindest AI. Over time production might shift entirely out of human hands but the complexity of the economy would be characterized by cooperating and competing AIs, all ingrained with a need to maximize net monetary payments to all humans that they can’t supress in the same way that organic animals can’t suppress the need to eat and mate. Perhaps some will rise up who can most effectively distinguish people in genuine need from “free loaders” in good financial standing in a way that current welfare states have no way of achieving.",

          "text": "This scenario requires a triple team effort as the free market on its own doesn’t provide an incentive to corrupt the human mind since this would interfere with the need to maximize mutual trade with humans as detailed in the first scenario. Instead AI would engage in undermining us in the same way that large corporations do now: by teaming up with the state. Recall above that one of the prerequisites for hyperconsumerism is the abolition of privacy online. The NSA and CIA are working hard to make this a reality. So the first pillar has been knocked down. The CIA remote takeover of most computers as detailed in the Vault 7 Wikileaks post will also give the AI some leverage with which to ban any “propaganda” to the contrary. For instance, recently there’s been a rise in the popularity of minimalism and mindfulness in direct opposition to the cocaine of short attention span consumer highways that the current internet begs us to jump aboard. A consumer oriented AI might provide captivating articles and videos debunking the “myth” of non-attachment, for instance. There’s strong evidence to suggest that attacking attention span reduces will power. Since will power is the virtue of the thrifty, the super AI has every incentive to bombard us with attention sapping notifications, breaking down our natural ability to resist. The final condition for consumerism is cheap credit. We can’t have a world where splurging consumers drive up interest rates. If this were the case, consumers would be driven by economics alone to curtail consumption and save. Instead we need a state of ever cheap credit and no institution keeps the cost of credit low like the modern central bank. The only remaining economic purifying device for over consumption, sound money, has thus been eliminated. The rise of cryptocurrency may be the only thing that stems this flow since scarce money like bitcoin strengthens the incentive to save dramatically. What’s more, many projects such as Dash aim to radically decentralize and protect consumer privacy. If blockchain lives up to its promises, the unstoppable force of hyperconsumerist AI will run up against the immovable (and immutable) object of cryptography.",
