In other words, when we use design to create something, this something will affect the way we come to interact with the world and hence the way we “see” the world — including the thing that triggered this process. When we do not look at such events, negative consequences can arise, such as patterns of passivity over non-functional designs — especially if the created thing reinforces the perception that it is not possible to create something better. But even when we become aware of harmful loops, it is possible that it is extremely difficult to modify them if the creation <-> creator relationship enters an equilibrium state, as exemplified by the concept of Attractor in Dynamic Systems.",

And there are many examples of how cultural elements have determined — and continue to determine — the relationships of human groups to each other, and to their environment. The Multilevel Selection Theory (MST) as put forward by evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson is one of them. MST states that egocentrism is an advantageous trait for individual intra-group dynamics (as a dispute between members of a group), while altruism and collaboration are more advantageous for inter-group dynamics (such as the territorial or population dispute of two groups in the same region). And the theory goes further to assert that the phenomenon of natural selection occurs at the scale of groups of individuals of the same species (and not just among individuals of this species), depending on the different interactions within and between groups 4 .",

So far, the less protected species have paid for the high price of this global economic culture with their existence. However, with the certainty of the beginning of the Anthropocene geological age — characterized by the human influence in its environment — we began to experience the same threats through natural disasters and intense changes in the planet’s regulatory mechanisms, such as global warming. Besides that, contemporary socio-cultural phenomena that present the same threat to life have similar origins. One example is radical terrorism, which is generally fueled by a post-colonial conjunctures characterized by a lack of resources and perspectives in countries that have had their natural and human resources seriously exploited.",

          "text": "It is understandable that the idea of ​​intentional design of cultural processes may cause fear in some readers. After all, wouldn’t this be the same as imposing ways of behaving in a population? No! It is important to clarify this point to understand the real potential of the field explored in this text. A quick historical reflection shows that cultural impositions that restrict a people’s freedom and self-determination have one overarching feature in common: they happen from top to bottom. In other words, they are imposed by a group that holds a greater determined power (warlike, economic, etc.) over a group of lesser power. This was true for the conquests of the Roman Empire, for the colonization of the Americas and Africa, and for the recent neoliberal wave. Quite different from that, what the field of Cultural Design proposes is an active approach to evolutionary-cultural processes through bottom-up dynamics. Rather than passively and unconsciously receive the cultural elements imposed on themselves, people and communities would be equipped with the knowledge and techniques of the field to determine for themselves which cultural elements should be fostered in future evolutionary processes. Most importantly, such groups would act in a manner that ensures that those goals are achieved.",

However, these groups rarely collaborate with one another on systemic efforts, such as combating the depletion of a region’s natural resources.

It includes topics like the study of tipping points, feedback loops, rules of local interaction, emergence of global behaviors, dynamic attractors, and so forth. ~ cognitive science brings together all that is known about human thought and behavior. It looks at the neural processing of language, how emotions shape reasoning, why the body and brain interact in profound and subtle ways that give rise to the making of meaning, and much more. ~ cultural evolution is the application of evolutionary principles to the emergence of fitness criteria for idea propagation. It looks at the spread of ideas and emergence of new cultural traits in social systems at the interpersonal and institutional scales. Taken together, these knowledge domains enable designers to engage in the many practices of “applied memetics” — uncovering the patterns of social change that arise when ideas and behaviors spread across social systems.
