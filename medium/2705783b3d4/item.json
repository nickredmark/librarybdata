I am delighted to have been able to weave this partnership. So much of my own learning — that has informed the content of Gaia Education’s online course in ‘Design for Sustainability’ (GEDS) — has been influenced by Fritjof’s work (see also ‘In gratitude to Fritjof Capra’).",

The aim of both is to create processes by which the ‘Global Goals’ can be achieved through local action — one community at a time.",

The current economic system is structurally dysfunctional and needs to be transformed. ‘Gross Domestic Product’ (GDP) is an inadequate measure of economic progress, and the notion of ‘development’ in biology and economics are very different and at odds with each other. In a regenerative culture the latter will have to serve the former, rather than the other way around. We need to create economic systems and indicators that reflect the ecological insight that ‘life creates conditions conducive to life.’",
