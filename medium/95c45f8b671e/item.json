And after spending such a long career really looking into how life works as a process and as a systemic interconnected process, what would you advise people to pay attention to in terms of what we need to do as human beings to redesign the human presence and impact on earth within the lifetime of the generations alive today? And in this process of redesigning our impact, what do we need to begin to do?",

So, there are over 200 pages of applications to the economy, to politics, to environmental activism, but also to medicine and health care management, various other things. And the same is true for my online course, the Capra Course, which begins with the theory, with The System’s View of Life, the nature of systems thinking, and then the systemic understanding of life. And then what does it mean for a systems view of health? What does it mean for the climate crisis? What does it mean for economics? And so on, and so forth. So I think from my early years of writing, The Turning Point in the early 1980s, I’ve always had applications in my mind.",

But the point is to change it.” And so in that sense, I’ve been Marxist in this broader sense in all my life, because the new understanding, the new paradigm, and the change of paradigms has important social and political implications, and they’ve always been in my mind since the 1960s. So in answer to your question, I think the great challenge of our time, the central challenge is to build sustainable communities, to build communities that do not interfere with nature’s inherent ability to sustain life. So for billions of years, nature has sustained ecosystems and individual species, and has sustained the processes of life. And human activities, especially since the Industrial age, have interfered with this ability to sustain life. And now we need to very urgently reconnect with nature, cooperate with nature, honor nature’s ability to sustain life, and organize ourselves accordingly.",

And I’ve come to the conclusion that you can summarize all these principles of ecology by saying nature sustains life by generating and maintaining communities. Community seems to be the key issue here, that we know that no living organism can exist in isolation. And in the long history of evolution from the very first bacterial cells, which emerged about three and a half billion years ago, from that point, those cells formed communities known as bacterial colonies. And ever since then, nature has created and sustained communities at all levels of life. So in the last few years, and this is not in the textbook, I didn’t write about this in the textbook which was published in 2014. So in the last six years, the importance of community has become ever more important to me, and has come to the foreground of my thinking evermore. And if you want to I can tell you why I think community is so important, there are several reasons.",

Until excessive material consumption, which is used by the corporate world to sustain the illusion of perpetual growth, corporate, and economic growth, this excessive consumption is seen as the way to happiness. If we can show that true happiness lies in human relationships rather than material consumption, in other words in community, then this is the biggest and most effective counter dose.

And it’s not learning in terms of just absorbing new information, but it’s learning this transformative, transformative learning that really changes our being, our values. And in my experience, community is the most effective vehicle for transformative learning, learning as a learning community. So those are three reasons. And there’s a fourth one and that is something we haven’t talked about yet, or implicitly we have but not explicitly. And that is that the change to a new paradigm is not only a conceptual problem, but it’s also a problem, and even more so a problem of values, a problem of ethics.",

And natural selection has favored those communities in which the individual members behave for the benefit of the community as a whole. And in the human realm, that’s what we call ethics.

Which is where most of our species history, we’ve lived in bioregional settlement patterns and in communities at the local level, whether we were nomads or settled. And when you really want to create the whole system’s design that creates all the benefits around renewable energies, circular bio-materials, economies, and all that, to do so at the scale of a community is difficult. Also, to do so at the scale of the city alone is difficult. But when you put the city or the community into the context of its watershed or region, it’s at that scale that those communities in that region collaborate to create designs that are regenerative and actually take care of the local ecosystem.",

He actually was very strongly influenced by Jan Christiaan Smuts who wrote the book on holism, and he tried something similar to that grand synthesis.

But Geddes was also the first person who, as a biologist, he is like he’s known for being one of the founders of the discipline of town planning and the scientific study of sociology.

And I agree completely with you, from a biological and ecological standpoint, you can say growth is an essential characteristic of life, all living organisms grow. But not everything grows at the same time and not everything grows all the time. So, in an ecosystem for instance, while certain things grow, others reach maturity, then decline, disintegrate and provide nourishment for new growth in the next season, like the leaves falling off trees and so on. So, what we need is this kind of growth and I called it qualitative growth, growth that is multifaceted and growth that includes inner growth in terms of an increase of complexity and maturity. And so what we very urgently need is to qualify growth, we need to distinguish between good growth and bad growth. And then we need to decrease the bad growth and increase the good growth.",

One other thing that I would love to pick up just also to honor a common friend of ours who’s sadly died over 10 years ago now, Professor Brian Goodwin who I met when you had started the Master’s in Holistic Science at Schumacher College. And one of the things that I learned so much from Brian in that time, one of the things that always struck me was that as one of the, you could say, founding fathers of complexity theory, as a mathematician and biologist, he always felt that central lesson of complexity was that, if you slightly simplify what’s the definition of a complex dynamic system, it’s any system that has more than three interacting variables. Going back to Poincare’s three-body problem, those systems are fundamentally unpredictable and uncontrollable beyond certain scales of space and time. So he said that really, and you alluded to it earlier, the purpose of the scientific enterprise for so long has been to predict, and control, and wrestle more manipulability out of complexity, out of the rest of nature.",

And in the biological community, people smile when they go, “Oh, there’s Brian Goodwin.” And this was long before complexity theory, but he was very unique as you know because he had a very rich philosophical and artistic background. And in science was an evolutionary biologist, complexity theorist, and because he was also a mathematician he also had a strong spiritual dimension. And that combination of art, and literature, and philosophy, and spirituality on the one hand, and science and mathematics on the other is very unique. And so Brian participated in many of my Schumacher courses and we had fabulous discussions.

Quality is a property of the whole, which is not present in the past, it’s a systemic property. For instance, my state of health is not the sum of the health of my heart, and liver, and my toes, and my teeth, but is a result of the interactions between those spots and the relationships between those spots.

And so I wrote this PhD and at the end of it, David actually ended up being my external examiner. And when it was all over and done, I went to see him at Oberlin College in Ohio. And I did an interview, which still floats about on YouTube somewhere. In 2006 with him where I asked him about, the original question was actually about the dimension of spirituality and the sacred in the transition that we now have to do to redesign the human impact on earth before our very young species would die an early death.",

He said, “Before we can ask or answer appropriately the what we need to do to create a sustainable human presence, or how we might go about doing it, we need to ask ourselves a more complicated question, a much more difficult question. Which is, what is it about human beings that makes us worth sustaining?” And that just for me was a big question to mull on for a long time. And I would love for you to give us your take from your long life, and having met some of the most inspiring human beings in my perspective on the planet in the last 50 years, what is it that you think is our unique contribution as human beings? And why would it be a shame if we died earlier as a species?",

And they are the ones that best contribute to the continual regeneration and unfolding of life. So, to the extent that we contribute to that, we are worth sustaining and we will be sustained by nature if we do that. To the extent that we are not contributing, which is much more at present than our contributions, we will not be sustained. If you look at the history of evolution, you can see that the average lifespan of a species from its emergence to extinction is about 5 million years. So, on the average there are species that have lived much longer and others much shorter, but the average is about 5 million years. Now, homo sapiens has lived for about 30,000 years, so we are newcomers still on the planet, we have lived less than 1% of the average lifespan of a species.",

And I would say that my sense of hope for sustainability and the continuation of humanity on the planet has been inspired very much by Vaclav Havel, the great Czech play write and former president of the Czech Republic. And Havel wrote something where he turns the assessment or the exploration of hope, into a meditation on the nature of hope. And he says that hope is a dimension of the soul, not the result of a certain assessment of the state of the world. And he writes, and he wrote this while he was imprisoned as a dissident by the Soviet regime. And let me read to you what he writes about hope. He writes, “Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out.” So this has inspired me tremendously for the last many years in the tide, trying to live my life.",

And facing almost like a species-level rite of passage, facing the real possibility of death at this early point in this jump to the next stage of being a more mature species, a more mature member in the community of life. I often find that what we actually ask to also come back to is where you also started.
