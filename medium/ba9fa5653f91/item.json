I don’t have an issue with that, but just knowing that that’s happening in the background. Because, personally, I just wanted to have a reconnect with you, have a catch up. And certainly if… Because there’s some other things that are brewing around us that I’m keen to continue the conversation with you, especially with some of the work we are doing in Auckland around the climate change work. So the council were quite interested in looking at a doughnut approach, a bit like what Amsterdam’s done. But certainly, in terms of some of the conversations that I started in London with Kate [Raworth, see below for the context within which Johnnie and I met in October 2019], is the opportunity to anchor it in an indigenous way, especially some of her work acknowledging some of those indigenous thinking.",

We said, “Oh, our ancestors must be guiding us.” Because a third person who’s come into the circle over the last couple of weeks is also another tribes person of ours from where my mother comes from.

Instead of looking for how do you connect the dots, so to speak, I always look at the space in between the dots and, actually, everything’s already connected. So what drew me into the doughnut was actually the space, and the inner circle for me represented the Earth Mother and the outer circle represented the Sky Father.

And part of our work is, especially with our disenfranchised, displaced Maori communities, which is prevalent across a number of indigenous communities throughout the world where there’s been a significant disconnection from our own circle systems. And so part of our own healing is the return back to circle systems. And, because the loss of language, loss of identity, our own native tongue can come across being jargon. It doesn’t mean anything because of that loss.

So we take children in state care from break downs in family, family violence. And Maori children are 80% of our population of state care.

Even what I noticed with a lot of English roots New Zealanders that I know, I’m always impressed how learning the language, for example, has just become fully something that one does. But how do we heal systemically everywhere? How do we enable people to come back into community and ask those questions that your community is asking, but ask them anywhere?",

So I’m involved in working on a regenerative program, which will probably end up being a 50 years piece of work around regeneration of a stream catchment in the southern part of our city, in Auckland, which also happens to be one of the socioeconomically depressed places. So, in our logic, the state of the stream reflects the state of the people, which is in not a good state. And so, working with council, what they’ve agreed to is to allow the whole operating system be anchored in indigenous systems thinking. Because they said, “Oh, why do we have to step into that binocular lens? Why can’t we go straight to one lens and let it be yours?” And that’s pretty powerful because that means that we help set the conditions of the garden. And so part of that is, using the garden analogy, is we’re helping prepare the garden and we won’t be around for the harvest in that sense.",

And, if they’re able to share the code through YouTube or whatever form in order to help connect the values, and that’s the most important thing, because, often, we get caught up at the surface level of this technology. If we put that technology within a circle system, then that’s all good. It’s sort of that methodology and method. So using square methods in a circle methodology, but that’s all good because of the context that it sits in and how you’re using it. And as opposed to square technology in a square system. That’s the risk and that’s that shift displacement of values. So it’s not so much the tech itself, it’s a system that the tech sits in. And that’s how we explain what the whole operating system, whole systems, are, is that you can have different models of practice that are like apps that sit within either Apple or Microsoft operating system, and it’s really about describing the circle system in that way, as that you can have all these different tools, frameworks, but it’s the actual system that it sits in and where you use it, and that comes down to your values.",

And when the government and our tribe were negotiating what the settlement look like, the government offered joint management of a national park, and our tribe said, “Actually, that’s not a national park to us, that’s our ancestor, and we don’t want to jointly manage our ancestor.” So their negotiations got suspended for almost two years because of this impasse of world view. And some creative person then turned around, “Well, why don’t we create a legal personality and what we’ll do is we’ll share care of this ancestor.” So, in a sense, the rights of nature have been acknowledged. And so, when we think about equity and equality, it’s not just from a human sense, it’s also the… And that’s at the heart of the reciprocity between humanity and nature in the way that we care for each other.

I think too, because I think what’s really critical and what is that we do have a Western system called regenerative development and thinking, a circular system. And I think things like climate change and COVID-19 is driving us to at least become aware of circle systems thinking. And I think that what has been working well within Auckland is that, and this is the impact of the work that Bill and Ben have been doing around Regenesis, is that we’ve got quite a significant number of regenerative practitioners and thinkers. And, albeit at the moment, it’s being tied to place making, which is a ironic term in itself, because place sort of shapes you, not the other way around, but it’s a North American, urban development term. And so that work, the program that I talked about, probably a 50 year program, is this opportunity. And so what we’re doing is we’re partnering with two circular systems approaches, the regenerative thinking and indigenous thinking. And I think that’s the key, is that, if we can start to recirculize square systems, it’s that square peg, round hole. And climate change, COVID-19, economic recovery creates that window for us to reimagine, reframe, and reset that thinking. Because if we can get two circle systems… In Maori culture, when we greet each other, we rub noses and have a hongi. So what we’re wanting to do is to have those two circles have a hongi.",
