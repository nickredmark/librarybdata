Thus, ecology — as a holistic approach to science — supports a shift in cultural metaphor from the overemphasis of the competitive aspects of nature to the recognition that life is a fundamentally cooperative and symbiotic process.

Relativity theory forced us to reconsider some fundamental assumptions about the natureofreality. It fused the previously mutually exclusive categories of space and time into an interrelated space-time continuum. Experience was recognized as dependent on the location and speed of the experiencing subject. Furthermore, the concepts of matter and energy also were brought into dynamic relationship, rather than existing as separate dualistic categories. The famous E= mc2 expresses a relationship between energy, mass (matter) and the speed of light, that describes the transformation of mass into energy and vice versa. The inherent lesson: The rigid categories that describe the Cartesian and Newtonian universe and its linear cause and effect laws and dualist either-or logic may be very useful within limits, but are insufficient abstractions of the true complexity of natural process.",

It is up to him to decide whether he shall measure position or momentum. To install the equipment to measure the one prevents and excludes his installing the equipment to measure the other. Moreover, the measurement changes the state of the electron. The universe will never afterwards be the same.

          "text": "1. Get the beat.\n Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. Starting with the behaviour of the system forces you to focusonfactsnottheories. It keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions, or those of others. The systems behaviour directs one’s thoughts to dynamic, not static analysis — not only what is wrong? But also how did we get here? And where are we going to end up?\n 2. Listen to the wisdom of the system.\n Aid and encourage the structures that help the system run itself. Don’t be an un-thinking intervener and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities. Before you charge into the make things better, pay attention to the valueofwhat’salready there.\n 3. Expose your mental models to the open air.\n Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be shot at. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Mental flexibility — thewillingnesstoredraw boundaries, to notice that a system has shifted into a new mode, to see how to redesign structure — is a necessity when you live in a world of flexible systems.\n 4. Stay humble. Stay a learner.\n Trust your intuition more and your figuring-out rationality less. Lean on both as much as you can, but still be prepared for surprises. In a world of complex systems it is not appropriate to charge forward with rigid, undeviating directives. What’s appropriate when you’re learning is small steps, constant monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it’s leading. Honour, facilitate and protect timely and accurate information!\n 5. Locate responsibility in the system.\n Look for the ways the system creates its own behaviour. Do pay attention to the triggering events, the outside influences that bring forth one kind of behaviour from the system rather than another. Sometimes outside influences can be controlled, and sometimes they can’t. Intrinsic responsibility means that the system is designed to send feedback about the consequences of decision-making directly and quickly and compellingly to the decision-makers.\n 6. Make feedback policies for feedback systems.\n You can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting system cannot be governed by static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops — loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process.\n 7. Pay attention to what is important, not to what is quantifiable.\n Our culture, obsessed with numbers, has given us the idea that what we can measure is more important than what we can’t measure. You can look around and make up your own mind about whether quantity or quality is the outstanding characteristic of the world in which you live.",

These individuals do not understand that the reduction of experimental variables (for example, isolation in a climate-controlled chamber to stabilize temperature and humidity) introduces many new biotic variables resulting from the absence of interacting organisms. I’m saying that the holistic approach of the Institute is realistic, practical, and approximates nature, but it is very disturbing to the scientist who thinks that if you break up very complex and interrelated problems into its smaller isolated components, solve each, and then reconstitute the many solutions into one, the result will solve the original problem. Biotic systems just do not work that way. I think that the Institute has a real scientific base and is investigating an incredibly difficult project. Barry Valentine (in Jack-Todd, 2005, p.124).",

These limitations have contributed to some of the difficulties we now face, such as the crisis of environmental deterioration, pollution, decreasing standards of health and quality of life, and loss of communal values. But Darwinism short-changes us as regards our biological natures. We are every bit as co-operative as we are competitive; as altruistic as we are selfish; as creative and playful as we are destructive and repetitive. And we are biologically grounded in relationships which operate at all the levels of our beings as the basis of our natures as agents of creative evolutionary emergence, a property we share with all other species (Goodwin, 1994, p.xiv).",

McHarg judged design according to its ‘fitness’ — the way it fitted into and affected natural process. He defined fitness not purely in Darwinian terms but saw Darwin’s understanding of fitness complemented by the suggestion of the biologist Lawrence Henderson, who proposed that the process of adaptation was mutual. The organism and the environment mutually adapt to each other, in a process that changes the relationships and interactions between the organism as a part and the environment as the whole that contains it. In this process neither the organism nor the environment remain unchanged (see McHarg, 1969).",

The non-living state of original geological matter, with its slow linear chemistry, undergoes transformations to a cyclic chemistry as it complicates into the high-energy state of self-reproducing living matter. In other words, life and non- life can be seen as two states or aspects over time of the same material. The whole biogeochemical process is cyclical, though it involves ever more of the original geological matter over time and is evolutionary in character. In short, this view suggests that organisms are transient parts of a relatively permanent cyclic process in which they both result from and produce a planetary metabolic system (Sahtouris, 1989, p.57).",
