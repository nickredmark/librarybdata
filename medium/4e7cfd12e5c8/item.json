The intelligence that evolved us from stardust and interconnects us with all beings is sufficient for the healing of our Earth community, if we but align with that purpose. Our true nature is far more ancient and encompassing than the separate self defined by habit and society. We are as intrinsic to our living world as the rivers and trees, woven of the same intricate flows of matter/energy and mind. Having evolved us into self-reflexive consciousness, the world can now know itself through us, behold its own majesty, tell its own stories — and also respond to its own suffering.”-Joanna Macy and Chris Johnstone (2012)",

Life’s way of accommodating this diversity in ways that optimize the whole system is a general tendency towards increasing integration, forming scale-linking networks of life-supporting relationships.",

[…] we invented ourselves (in effect) in response to various ecological pressures and opportunities” (Corning, 2005: 40).

There may be a delicately balanced interplay between these supposedly polar relationships.” p.38).
