It is like asking someone where the color blue comes from in the atmosphere and having them say it comes from the sky. That isn’t an explanation; it’s a stand-in for real knowledge that lacks clarity about the physical mechanisms involved. (Side note: A proper answer would be that the color blue comes from the diffraction of solar radiation as it interacts with air molecules that selectively absorb, scatter, and reflect solar energy in a manner highly sensitive to wavelengths of light — as computed in the sensory/perception circuitry of the human visual system in our brains.)",

Instead it is morally-driven ideologues that espouse the worldview of Neoliberalism who routinely call the shots. And their story of wealth creation is like a bucket with holes in it.
