          "text": "As figure one illustrates, some of these phases escalate complexity and increase risk, while others release complexity and decrease risk. Some of the phases are derived from complex adaptive processes (CAP) and others from complex responsive processes (CRP). Adaptive processes function in contexts that are known and have regular feedback loops, such as adapting to drought conditions or interest rates. Responsive processes function where there is no context that gives a direction or meaning to decisions, options or actions. Responsive processes are spontaneous and open-ended, and their outcomes emergent. Being able to identify and inquire into these different processes enables teams to adopt intentional practices that can help integrate strategic conversations around different phases of change.",

In an ecosystem, this means optimizing energy flows in and out of different ecological niches. In an organization, this means optimizing resource allocations in and out of different locations. In an organization, strategic decisions steer resources such as investment and budgets, equipment and facilities, training and compensation, in some directions more than others. Collaborative strategic conversations motivate teams to put more of their intentions and energy in some directions more than others. If a team or organization can successfully allocate resources to all phases of change, it can maximize innovation and novelty, and remain highly resilient to capture or disruption. But this is not merely about “scrambling.” It is about cultivating a high capacity for designing, refining, and redefining what you are doing all at the same time.",

Borrowing from Wilma Koutstaal’s encyclopedic research on The Agile Mind helps us understand how we can practice shifting strategic conversations back and forth from constrained to enabling, by oscillating between abstract, generalized modes of thinking and concrete, specified modes. In abstract, generalized modes we “zoom out” to the bigger picture. This bigger picture can be shaped in terms of constraints, boundaries, and parameters, in order for us to refine or revise our work. User stories in software development are these types of adaptive measures. We can also employ big picture thinking to craft virtual spaces of possibility, in order to reflect and inquire about what we are doing, why we are doing it, what impulses, desires, and aspirations are we responding to. This often entails making conscious what is already operating subconsciously, or in the collective unconscious.",

It is easy to see how the process of making the abstract and generalized concrete and specific can place constraints on our work by defining and designing many specific details. It is harder to see how making something concrete and particular can be an enabling process. Unfortunately, very few people have the talent to employ this mode of learning in an enabling way — that is a mode of inquiry, that seeks to redefine the problem space through experiment and discovery. According to recent research, we unlearn the ability to poke and prod our way to novel discoveries by the time we are nine years old. With three years of schooling under our belts, we have already been conditioned to over think and under play. Creative innovation is oftentimes a process of regaining this capacity to unleash and enable ingenuity through attention on the concrete and particular, in a spirit of intense curiosity and deep focus. In The Art of Learning, Josh Waitzkin calls this a practice of “making smaller circles,” the power of which develops a profound mastery of what otherwise might be overlooked as a rather basic skill set.
