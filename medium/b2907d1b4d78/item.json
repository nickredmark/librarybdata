Nation states arose largely within these capitalist frameworks for binding ownership within an enclosed space. So in a great twist of irony, it was capitalism that centralized power for elites — and it was later the emergence of representative democracies that began to undo this pattern of control via ownership and legal contracts (e.g. corporations).",
