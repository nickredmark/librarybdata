In much of the literature on transformative change that metaphor plays easily and unconsciously into Joseph Campbell’s review of mythic narrative: the hero’s journey. That in turn feeds a demand for ‘heroic leadership’, ‘heropreneurship’ and other forms of heroic self-sacrifice in pursuit of world-changing goals.",

It tells the allegorical journey of everyman, in the character of the pilgrim Christian, “from this world to that which is to come”. The book provides a metaphorical map, setting out from the “city of destruction” through the “slough of despond” to “the celestial city”, and also a set of resources for the journey. This book has something of the same inspirational and practical quality. Perhaps it is no coincidence to find that Daniel’s middle name is Christian.",
