In his most popular book, Design with Nature, first published in 1969, McHarg proposes an understanding of evolution as a goal directed process leading towards an increase of complexity, order, diversity, cooperation, dynamic stability and consciousness. In order to design with nature human artefacts, edifices and institutions need to integrate into and positively contribute to this evolutionary process. Natural design is inspired by, learns from, and adapts to the forms and processes we observe in the natural world and aims to contribute positively to the health of the living planet as a whole. … Through adapting our designs to the opportunities and challenges of a particular environment, we can intelligently and creatively meet human needs within the limits of the environment and thereby contribute to overall diversity and dynamic stability, which is synonymous with human and planetary health (Wahl, 2005c, p.16).",

It expressed McHarg’s conviction that in order to create socially and ecologically appropriate designs we will have to engage in a trans-disciplinary dialogue that helps us to build a multi-perspective understanding of the context within which we are creative as designers. A wide range of guest speakers contributed diverse perspectives from disciplines including: philosophy, theology, anthropology, psychology, economics, ecology, epidemiology, sociology and poetry.",

I would suggest that McHarg was fully aware that he was using two of the most effective media for cultural transformation in order to raise ecological awareness. Following the terminology introduced in chapter one, I would suggest that McHarg engaged in effective meta-design. He attempted to change design up-stream, in people’s conscious awareness and worldviews. The following three quotations from Design with Nature illustrate why McHarg will come to be remembered as a timely catalyst for the emergence of the ecological or natural design movement:",

The software can be used to overlay various maps — McHarg originally used hand-drawn acetates — depicting important environmental attributes of the area in question. By superimposing maps of the regional water courses, soil types, fauna, vegetation and geology, McHarg was able to better assess the probable environmental impact of a development in a certain site. The multi-layer mapping methodology helps in identifying suitable locations for new developments as well as ecologically and hydrologically sensitive areas that need to be protected from further development. “McHarg used a non-computerized version of this process as early as 1961, during his involvement with the highway route selection of the US Interstate 95, the first planning endeavour to employ a methodology for environmental impact assessment” (Wahl, 2005c, p.15).",

To date, McHarg’s theory of appropriate form still lacks recognition. Its significance has not been understood widely enough. The theory applies to design on all scales, from product to bioregion and beyond. McHarg expressed these ideas most clearly in 1968, when he was invited to address the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton University. He later gave the same paper at the Smithsonian Institution and it was eventually published under the title ‘Values, Process and Form.’ While aspects of the paper — with regard to word use and a few conceptual aspects– may seem slightly dated, it is nevertheless still deeply relevant today and should be discussed within any design curriculum. McHarg formulates an understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature based on life as a syntropic or negentropic agent in the evolution of the universe. Buckminster Fuller and McHarg are likely to have influenced each other in their formulation of this dynamic perspective.",

So, too, can the biosphere be considered as a single superorganism in which the oceans and the atmosphere, all creatures, and communities play roles analogous to cells, tissues, and organs.” McHarg emphasized: “That which integrates either the cell in the organism or the organism in the biosphere is a symbiotic relationship. In sum, these are beneficial.” From this understanding McHarg concluded: “Symbiosis is the indispensable value in the survival of life forms, ecosystems, and the entire biosphere” (McHarg, 1968, p.67).

Life has proceeded from simple to complex, although the simplest forms have not been superseded, only augmented. It has proceeded from uniform to diverse, from few to many species. Life has revealed evolution as a progression from greater to less entropy. In the beginning was the atom of hydrogen with one electron. Matter evolved in the cosmic cauldrons, adding electron after electron, and terminated in the heaviest and most ephemeral of elements. Simple elements conjoined as compounds, thus reaching the most complex of these as amino acids, which is to say life. Life reached unicellular form and proceeded through tissue and organ to complex organisms. There were few species in the beginning and now there are myriad; there were few roles and now they are legion. There were once large populations of few species; now there is a biosphere consisting of multitudes of communities composed of innumerable interacting species. Evolution has revealed a progression from simple to complex, from uniform to diverse, from unicellular to multicelled, from few to many species, from few to many ecosystems, and the relations between these processes have also evolved toward increased complexity” (McHarg, 1968, p.65).",

          "text": "“Ecological planning seeks to fit consumer and environment. This problem-solving and problem-seeking quest conforms to the definition of health. Ecological planning should be health giving. Success in such planning or fitting should be revealed in the existence of healthy communities, physical, biological, and social system in dynamic equilibrium. However, many persons and institutions may satisfy the definition of health by seeking and solving problems but still succumb to disease and death from causes of which they are ignorant or causes beyond their control. As a result a specialization in health planning has been developed within the realm of human ecological planning. This subscribes to … ecological theory and method … but uses as its viewpoint the degree to which actions by persons, groups, or institutions enhance or diminish health and well being” (McHarg, 1981, p.153).",

From baseline to present, we must observe changes and the operation of constituent processes, particularly biogeochemical cycles. … I can think of no human activity of greater importance. It should be seen as the primary consequence of recognizing the global environment as the principal objective in the world’s agenda. It identifies the most important purpose of the world’s population for now and all time. We must come to know this world, to understand how it works, and to regulate our behaviour to maintain and enhance the biosphere. We must identify the welts, lesions, wounds, and suppurations on the global epidermis. We must learn to green the earth, to restore the earth, to health the earth. I long to live to see it” (McHarg, 1996, p.374).",
