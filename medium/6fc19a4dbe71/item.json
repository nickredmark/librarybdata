We can become responsible key-stone species in the community of life and begin to undo the damage we have done and regenerative healthy ecosystems everywhere. As one of my mentors, David Orr, once said: “Hope is a verb with its sleeves rolled up.”",

In the end, what kind of regenerative culture would I be promoting, if I did so at the cost of my daughter not having her dad in close proximity? I am prioritising my immediate family over my compulsion to “save the world” for now. In October, I will be bringing my family back to Findhorn for a week, as I am scheduled to give a TEDx talk in the Universal Hall on October 13th. Hope to see you there!",
