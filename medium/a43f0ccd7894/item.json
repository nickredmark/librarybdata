The single organism (or species) that is supposed to compete with others does not exist [original italics].

And they still are. […] Biological, technological, and social progress, so the argument goes, is brought forth by the sum of individual egos striving to out-compete each other. In perennial rivalry, fit species (powerful corporations) exploit niches (markets) and multiply their survival rate (profit margins), whereas weaker (less efficient) ones go extinct (bankrupt). This metaphysics of economics and nature, however, is far more revealing about our society’s opinion about itself than it is an objective account of the biological world.",

Many of the key concepts that helped Charles Darwin to construct the central argument of his theory of evolution by natural selection were influenced by the economic theories of his time, for example the work of Adam Smith and the political economist Robert Malthus’s obsession with “the idea of scarcity as a driving force of social change” (Weber, 2013: 24).",
