Wahl asserts, for instance, that the “calls for degrowth” are getting louder all the time, forgetting that the original debate about limits to growth reverberated throughout mainstream politics throughout the 1970s, only to disappear almost without trace in the 1980s. And whilst it’s true that the “meme of ecologically inspired design” is indeed out there making gentle waves in the world of design, the mainstream worlds of design, engineering and business education have been unbelievably slow in responding to a physical world already transformed (largely for the worse) by today’s overlapping ecological disasters.",
