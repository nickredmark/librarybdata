Spend a week exposed in the wilderness and the meaning of shelter will impose itself upon you soon enough. In many ways, the higher order of needs are pure surplus. If you are struggling to survive, you have neither time nor sensitivity to art or poetry. A culture of basic need is starkly utilitarian.

In many ways, the “punk aesthetic” is all about getting the execution entirely out of the way and focusing on pure authenticity. In an environment where artifice is everywhere and it becomes difficult to tell what is good and what simply tastes good, this kind of approach is needful. However, it has its drawbacks. Style is also needful – there is only so much that can be expressed directly and through unmediated intensity. Passion can open one to the meaning of connection – but it is hard-pressed to inspire wonder.\nThere seem to be two movements here.

All of this is meaningful. There is a depth to this experience. It is, precisely because of it’s synthetic breadth and depth, meaningful.

That is, the more it carries in itself, the less likely that it can be used inauthentically. Remember that summer that you read To Kill a Mockingbird? Staying up late and smelling the wet grass? Riding in the back of a pick-up-truck to camp near the lake? Remember Boo Radley? Atticus Finch? There is a fundamental authenticity of To Kill a Mockingbird that is adequate to your own synthetic experience. In a sense, it can never betray you – can never be used against you, precisely because it has a heart of its own.",
