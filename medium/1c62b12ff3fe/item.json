Even to observe so miniscule an object as an electron, he must shatter the glass. He must reach in. He must install his chosen measuring equipment. It is up to him to decide whether he shall measure position or momentum. To install the equipment to measure the one prevents and excludes his installing the equipment to measure the other. Moreover, the measurement changes the state of the electron. The universe will never afterwards be the same. To describe what has happened, one has to cross out that old word ‘observer’ and put in its place the new word ‘participator’. In some strange sense the universe is a participatory universe.”",

Rather life itself has to be regarded as belonging in some sense to a totality, including plant and environment. It may indeed be said that life is enfolded in the totality and that, even when it i s not manifest, it is somehow ‘implicit’ in what we generally call a situation in which there is no life.”",

Carol Sanford and Pamela Mang worked with Charlie Krone closely and learned from him many of the frameworks that are now underlying deep regenerative practice. … and while I am at it: one of the seed kernels for getting Otto Scharmer on the track of developing Theory U was also triggered by him interviewing Henri Bortoft.)",
