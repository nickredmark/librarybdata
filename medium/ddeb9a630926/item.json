Consider: since you only earn tokens for content that is actually uploaded and only in-demanded content is downloaded at any meaningful rate, every client who is motivated to earn tokens would be motivated to use their own market intelligence to decide which content to host and make available. For example, if you see some video that you think is currently under-supported, it would be in your interest to download it (at your cost) so that you could then provide it back into the network at a relative profit.",

Lots of pirated content and porn. Now, if I recall, Megaupload was making a lot of money before it got shut down and Popcorn Time had a pretty decent number of users. If DAPT works at all, it could quickly get millions — perhaps tens of millions — of users. Combine audience with monetization and discovery and it will elegantly and seamlessly begins to transition into a really powerful, high quality and nearly uncensorable media platform.",

The way the backfeed protocol works, early developers are directly rewarded with tokens. Build this thing and you end up holding exactly the same tokens that will later be purchased to download the content. If it takes off, these could be worth some real money. Maybe not Kimdotcom money, but well worth the time and effort and a whole lot safer.",
