When the human is centralized in one state of existence, he or she has a psychology which is particular to that state. His or her feelings, motivations, ethics and values, biochemistry, degree of neurological activation, learning system, belief system, conception of mental health, ideas to what mental illness is and how it should be treated, conceptions of and preferences for management, education, economics, political theory and practice are all appropriate to that stage.",

People have grown more dependent on this system of production but, at the same time, more alienated from it.",

It is in these sectors that we can find examples of synergic types of behaviour which offer a potential response to the crisis that looms over us. — Manfred Max-Neef, 1991, p.28",
