The project explored how to design cities based on ‘ecological performance standards’ by benchmarking the urban design project against the original ecosystem of the given locale and establishing the metrics of how the natural environment should perform: “How many millimetres of soil, how many tons of carbon, how much water stored, how much air purified?” Janine Benyus argues: “It is not enough to have green roofs and walls, we will need to ask how a building will store carbon. We need cities to perform like ecosystems, not just look like them” (Oppenheimer, 2010).",

On a predominantly urban planet, cities will need to adopt circular metabolic systems to assure their own long-term viability as well as that of the rural environments on which they depend.” He suggests: “Policy makers, the commercial sector and the general public need to jointly develop a much clearer understanding of how cities can develop a restorative relationship to the natural environment on which they ultimately depend” (Girardet, 2010).

Systems integration, win-win-win solutions and decentralized systems that meet local demand through local supplies, are all aspects of such urban and regional biomimicry at the ecosystems level. The movement of ‘bioregionalism’ (Brunckhorst, 2002) which started in the 1970s is worth revisiting in this context. The founders of the Bioregional Development Group suggest:",

If we were to take these external costs into account, we would see the balance shifting towards smaller scale, more diverse local and regional development, or bioregional development. We can then reap the benefits of bioregional advantage. It will not take much to tip the balance and make bioregional development a much bigger part of the mainstream economy.",
