          "text": "A Universal Basic Income. As I have mentioned several times, I consider this to be “baked in” to at least the transition to an “Abundance economy”. It is conceivable that within a generation or two of shifting to an Abundance framework, we will no longer have need of a Basic Income — but for the immediate term, it is the best answer. Ideally, I think that the UBI should empower actual autonomy — it should be no-strings attached and provide enough resources for an individual to live a reasonable life with no additional income. I’ll have to write another post soon on precisely how I see this rolling out (and how we pay for it), but in the meantime, I point you to the excellent work of Scott Santens on the topic.",
