I think what we’ve seen over this year is that all the reports on how quickly climate change is advancing have been wrong; it’s even faster. The interacting feedback loops are so daunting, really, that when you look at the climate science, the “probable” looks grim. Therefore, we really need to live in that space of accepting that something is dying away.",

It’s a wonderful community that is trying to transform the business world from within, and bring all these transformative ideas to the business world, but it’s still running against the boundaries of that world that want to maintain its structures. Nora invited everybody, after two days of talking about transformative change, to say, “Look, we really need to ask ourselves every time we use that word, transformation: are we going to end up with caterpillars with wings or are we going to end up with butterflies?”",
