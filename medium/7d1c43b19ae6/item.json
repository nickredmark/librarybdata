It is also true that once we start the practice of caring for others (humans and other species) in the same way as we care for ourselves, we begin to realize that our perception of a separate self was in itself a limited perspective. We are relational beings in a world where everything affects everything and therefore to care for others is to care for our self. We are integral participants and expressions of Life.",

Even in dedicating our lives to the creation of a regenerative culture and a more sustainable future, we are not ‘saving the planet’ or ‘saving life on Earth.’ Both will continue long after our species meets its almost inevitable fate of extinction. Nevertheless, we don’t have to actively accelerate our own demise, as we have done with increasing effort since the industrial revolution.",
