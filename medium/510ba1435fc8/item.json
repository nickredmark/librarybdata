How our organising ideas and the way we think shape the world. We think it is all just out there, but it is not. We also co-created in in the way we are in relationship with it. That was really influential on me when I as at Schumacher College in 2001/2002 and worked with Henri directly. … and in 2007 I met Tony Hodgson who later invited me into the International Futures Forum (IFF). Tony was at J.G.
