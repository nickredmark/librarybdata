At a high level, this function should be designed to take advantage of maximum “collective intelligence.” This might be best done with a mixture of AI and “liquid democracy”. On the AI side, all of the financial information in the League will be constantly tracked in realtime and processed to give information on estimated cashflows and projected capital needs. On the liquid democracy side, one could imagine that some fraction of capital reserves would be assigned to every League member for either direct or proxy application. So for example, if a core of League members believed that it was useful for the League to buy facilities in Iceland for cloud computing infrastructure, they could self-assemble a team to do the work and proxy enough capital to them to do it. Returning to the AI, it would seem entirely likely that an organization like the League would turn some of its enormous capacity towards, for example, tracking the capital allocation performance of every member of the League and empirically surfacing the “team most likely” to effectively execute on any given mission. This is all downstream fun, of course, for when the League has captured dominant markeshare in every software market and has an unreasonably large amount of excess capital to deploy. For the first five years, the expectation would be that most capital allocation would go into salaries and core computational infrastructure and would be relatively simply managed.",

The advantage of this kind of approach is that it allows “rolling capitalization” at a level of granularity that is much more sensitive than analog capital markets. Raise $500k equivalent to kick off the search. As you see the kind of talent why is joining the league and watch what you are doing, periodically take in small chunks of crypto capital in response to the real increase in the value-potential of the League. When you are talking about finding and empowering people like Bram Cohen, Markus Persson, and Janus Friis, the likelyhood that interesting things will result is relatively high . . .",
