Wilson’s classic book Sociobiology laid out a clear framework for how to study the social behavior of animals. B.F. Skinner wrote a poignant essay in 1982 titled Why We Are Not Acting to Save the World that explains how difficult it will be to guide our own behaviors toward sustainability. I was especially impressed by Lonnie Aarson’s What Are We? The Evolutionary Roots of Our Future that makes a sobering case for how difficult human sustainability will be to achieve from an evolutionary perspective. Many others could also be named… simply look at the writings of Paul Shepard, David Abrams, Pascal Boyer, Fritjof Capra, Joanna Macy, and a hundred others.",
