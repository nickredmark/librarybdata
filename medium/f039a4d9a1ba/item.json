The hoe, a primitive tool way back when, started the process by which we began to tinker with climate, and we have accelerated that so that it is now an exponential process. So the problem that we have, as a species, is that we have been digging a hole for ourselves as a species for a very long time, and the last 50 to 70 years the damage has become what appears to be catastrophic if allowed to go much further.",
