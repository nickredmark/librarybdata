But it is harder to comprehend the social, political, economic, and ecological effects of increasing velocity of money and information, which are often indirect and hidden. Increasing velocity of commerce, information, and transport however, requires more administration and regulation of human affairs to ameliorate congestion and other problems. More administration means that there are fewer productive people, higher overheads, and higher taxes to pay for more infrastructure necessitated by the speed of people and things and problems of congestion. Increasing velocity and scale tends to increase the complexity of social and ecological arrangements and reduce the time available to recognize and avoid problems. Cures for problems caused by increasing velocity often set in motion a cascading series of other problems. As a result, we stumble through a succession of escalating crises with diminishing capacity to act intelligently. Other examples fit the same pattern such as the velocity of transportation, materials flows, extraction of non-renewable resources, introduction of new chemicals, and human reproduction. At a local scale the effect is widening circles of disintegration and social disorder. At the global scale, the rate of change caused by increasing velocity disrupts biological evolution and the biogeochemical cycles of the earth.",
