In this series I am concerned with new perspectives about organizational life, at all scales, that emerge from the complexity sciences. Complexity science itself is a work in progress, with divergent notions from different complexity thinkers and theorists. Since complexity deals with situations that are uncertain, far from equilibrium, and unpredictable, it is a hard idea for scientists to wrap their head around. Complexity means we cannot make simple if-then propositions about “the system.” Without if-then propositions, we cannot make hypotheses to test our ideas, to formulate a valid theory. In what sense, then, can the field of complexity even be considered a science?",

You respond to rising and falling patterns, small sequences of repetition, that move you across thresholds from one state to another. Two dry days in a row becomes a protential drought, and so you get out the hose and water, instead of doing the weeding you had otherwise planned. Slow, small changes that are sensitive to short local patterns, run through over and over again. Eventually you inuit the “phase state” or just “state” of a situation, like being able to discern ice melting into water, and water boiling into steam. Things change shape but complex processes change states. Knowing this, being able to discern this, too, is a kind of science. A kind of science so intuitive we often call it “the art” of something.",
