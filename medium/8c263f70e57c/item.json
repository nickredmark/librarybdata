A hairs breadth from a high of $59.38 it had hit in December of 1999 and the highest point Microsoft stock would see for the next sixteen years. On April 3, 2000, Judge Jackson ruled that the company had violated anti-trust laws. The company appealed immediately, but the ruling saw the company’s stock enter into a steep downward spiral, dropping 45% by the end of the month.",

The “Dot Com” bubble had burst and it would continue to shed value until bottoming out with a near 75% loss by the fall of 2002.
