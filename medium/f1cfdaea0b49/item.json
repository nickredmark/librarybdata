As the bloom is fading from the Millennial (nee Generation Y) rose, marketers and social commentators are turning their eyes on the next sweet young thing: that cohort of people born somewhere around the turn of the Millennium. What is interesting to me is how very silly most of these conversations tend to be — making the consistent human mistake of linear projection. Just like 50's era futurists imagined a world of flying cars, there is a consistent mistake of assuming that the next generation will be some next version of Millennials. This couldn’t be farther from the truth. So, to throw my hat into the ring, I will call them the “Omega Generation” because these kids will be in many profoundly important ways, the last generation.",

There is controversy around the very notion of a “generational type,” and, certainly, most pop culture typologies have been little more than caricature. Yet, at the same time, there is good reason to believe that a cohort of people who were born into the same historical era, and, therefore, exposed to a similar set of “enculturating forces” will share a usefully similar set of sensibilities. While these shared sensibilities will of necessity be broad, general and diffuse, the fact that they are shared by an entire cohort means that their social impact will be substantial over the long term.",

For example, unlike previous generations for whom media was an act of passive consumption (whatever is on NBC at 8 is what you are going to watch), their most fundamental assumption is the inverse: not only can you choose, but you must choose from a nearly unlimited selection.

For millennia, we have (at least ostensibly) aspired to a world characterized by inner and outer peace.

It seems a desperately foolish hope to think that in a mere twenty years we could bring a critical mass of humanity to a level of wisdom, compassion and integrity that is adequate to the task.",

Certainly, the Baby Boomer generation in America has deep differences from their British or German or Japanese peers. But equally certainly, they have much more in common than did their respective parents or grandparents. In the intervening seventy years, global media, global technology, global trade and an increasing synchronization of global crisis events has only served to intensify global culture.",

Unlike every previous period in human history where the kind, the creative and the wise have been voices in the wilderness; over the next twenty years, these voices will be able to find each other and when they do they will be able to coordinate and cooperate in ways that let them rapidly take leaps ahead of everyone else.
