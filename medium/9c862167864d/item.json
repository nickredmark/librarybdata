Systems science provides a conceptual basis for defining “health..” This conceptual foundation must be integrated with social values in order to arrive at scientifically valid but necessarily subjective criteria for ecosystem health. Empirical work has established some of the basic symptoms of stressed ecosystems. As clinical ecology matures, the emphasis should shift away from curative approaches (the focus on ecosystem disabilities) to preventive approaches (with focus on ecosystem capabilities). In shifting from curative to preventative medicine, a salutogenic perspective suggests the need for non-invasive tests that in effect gauge healthiness. Administering carefully controlled stress tests to ascertain the degree of ecosystem integrity may provide a method for discovering occult diseases in ecosystems well before overt signs of pathology appear. But many challenges lie ahead. These include designing non-invasive stress tests for critical ecosystem functions as well as developing a better taxonomy of ecosystem ills, more rigorous diagnostic capabilities, and methods to proposed treatments or interventions in efforts to restore ecosystem health.",
