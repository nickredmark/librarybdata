I forget who it was who said, “History is just one damn thing after another.” (Oh, yeah, it was Arnold Toynbee [one of the advantages of transferring my talk to writing is that I can look up references like that!].)",

          "text": "I’d say “progression” in terms of the evolution of complex systems is the same thing as “history.” It doesn’t necessarily move in a straight line; sometimes developments are kind of surprising. Indeed, one reasonable definition of a complex system is that it should be capable of surprising an observer, at least sometimes. For instance, consider a star that’s been doing its thing quietly for a couple of billion years. After billions of years of being a bright and shiny star, it blows up, because it’s reached a major transition point as a complex system. By going supernova, it’s changed so much as to be unrecognizable. What was once a stable star has now become a rapidly expanding ball of dust and gas that emits more energy over the course of a few months than it did in its entire lifespan as a star — surprising, to say the least.",

So, again, focus at least some of your political energy on the deep issues, for example, money in politics. Push for a people’s monetary system that privileges citizens over banks. What if, instead of banks creating money for their own profit, the new money that entered the system came as a grant for each citizen per capita? Wouldn’t that be interesting? Also: useful and transparent finance, a serious carbon tax,, and a citizenship wage, where each citizen got, let’s say, $10,000 a year just for showing up, paid for by eliminating means-tested social programs and implementing a small (less than 1 percent) wealth tax. These are ways to substantially redress the imbalance between the people and the money, and it’s within the power of the people to do this.

You have to be ready to accept some pain in your life if you are going to make a difference. Resist the temptation of opiates: pharmaceutical or metaphysical!",

I enjoy speculation on the underlying nature of reality as much as the next person, but I don’t fall into the error of thinking that metaphysical speculation has any reasonable probability of providing important answers on how to build a better society today. Certainly the last 2500 years of history has shown that metaphysical speculations have never provided reliable truths. Thunder isn’t caused by Thor’s hammer. Zeus doesn’t throw lightning bolts; Aristotle’s metaphysical system of physics was absurd. Nor is some new, magical approach to “thinking” going to produce the society that we want.",

So while I’ll laugh at and make fun of various zany belief systems, I’ll fight to the death for your right to have those beliefs. At the same time, I’ll also fight to the death against a system that tries to impose one true metaphysical road on everybody.
