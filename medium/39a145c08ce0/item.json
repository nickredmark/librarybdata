One of the reasons why the UN ‘Agenda 2030’ and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are meeting with more enthusiasm at the community level or by grassroots organizations is that Goal 8 is not a goal to aim for but the driver of degeneration and un-sustainability affecting all other 16 goals negatively. For the SDGs to be taken up more widely, the UN needs to dare to question dangerous economic ideologies and begin to envision a regenerative economy that is no longer based on an monetary systems that necessitate quantitative economic growth. At the very least SDG 8 should be reworded as ‘Qualitative Economic Growth and Decent Work’. For more on the shift from quantitative to qualitative growth see here.",
