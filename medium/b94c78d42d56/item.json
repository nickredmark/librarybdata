Each in its own way brings advanced training to scholars and researchers working across disciplines on extremely complex challenges.

Do they train people to intervene in ways that can save us from running ourselves off a civilizational cliff? I ask this question because the current reality is very much one of humanity speeding toward this increasingly inevitable outcome. Whether you consider the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of 2005, increasing alarm bells in every new report of the IPCC, or the crossing of planetary boundaries identified by the Stockholm Resilience Center, it is clear that humanity is either on the threshold of catastrophic collapse or it will soon cross a threshold that may not be seen until it is too late.",

A few among many that could be named are Antioch University, Evergreen State College, and Schumacher College. Each has in its own way sought to address the limitations of more “mainstream” universities by crafting programs in whole system design, integrative approaches to environmental studies, and related topics. My response to this criticism is that — while I applaud these efforts — they are not capable of scaling up with research infrastructure to do things like build high-performance computing facilities, fund advanced materials research laboratories, create collaborative frameworks across national labs and other universities to achieve things like the Human Genome Project or the creation of an ecological equivalent to what CERN is for particle physics.",

I, for one, have chosen the problem-focused approach that requires partnerships across many academic subjects. As more scholars make this choice, there will be increasing pressure to serve this population as the looming challenges intensify on the world stage.",
