Some dynamic — say hip hop — begins as an emergent potential that is poorly understood, largely ineffective in expressing its power and with few linkages/allies in its ambient environment. If this dynamic has the right elements, it will slowly grow. It will get better at expressing its power, change and form alliances, break down inhibitors and move to the “inflection point” where it rapidly accelerates into the larger cultural dynamic. It will then transition into its fullness and become integrated into the larger cultural dynamic — with ripple effects up and down all other systems. It will then begin to become “root bound” as it deploys its potential into actuality and begins to have “decreasing returns to complexity”. It enters the “rococo phase” becomes less creative and is in turn disrupted by something new that has emerged in its context.",

Even as rock and roll was moving through culture, we saw economic disruptions relating to the triumph of the union movement, the migration of labor in the post-War environment. We saw s-curves in family dynamics associated with the expansion out of dense multi-family urban environment into nuclear (and relatively mixed) suburbs. We saw s-curves in gender relations.

It is at least as significant as the inflection point around the 17th/18th Century (which led among other things to science, industrialism, the rise of cities and the downfall of monarchy).
