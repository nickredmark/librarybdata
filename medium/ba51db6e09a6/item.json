But also not basking in the pain of having been party to those horrors, (which is equally self-serving). I have benefitted from the exploitation of others and the natural world. Sick but true. There is nothing to gain by justifying or denying that fact. My comfort has been made possible by the suffering of others. There are generations of pain, trauma, and confusion that have been produced by the systems that give me my food, clothing, transportation, banking, and everything else in my world. No point in pretending that is not true. Even though my family has been advocating for the interdependency of life across many fields for at least three generations, I am still dressed in blood. The illusions that have made this life are ghosting around me, they always will be.",

One thing I am starting to get the hang of is igniting suspicion toward those impulsive solutions that appear at first to make the most logical and rational sense, recognizing that they are probably informed by the same systems that created the problems to begin with. I am in rapid wide-angle receptivity mode, — all senses on. I am watching the scaffolding of the last century of exploitation pixilate and melt. I am sad, mad, lost, sorry, and grateful.
