Transdisciplinary design dialogue can help to contextualize the contributions that diverse perspectives can make to more inclusive decision-making processes that are informed by a wider knowledge base. Often, problems dissolve if we shift to a different perspective. As we explore different scales of context from the perspectives of different value-systems, we might suddenly reconsider the soundness of the underlying design brief, or begin to question the need for, or purpose of, the design in question.",
