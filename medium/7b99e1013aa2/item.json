Thanks so much for the conversation we just had, part one, and now we’re taking a little bit of a deep dive into some of the things that I learned from you and also, would love to have your reflections on in terms of my own learning. One, I came a couple of years ago, when I was writing my book, Designing Regenerative Cultures, I came across the work of a biologist and systems theorist called John Stewart. He described evolution in a way that I’d not heard it described before, but it really made a lot of sense to me. He said that the general process of evolution is a process of diversification and then subsequent integration of that diversity at higher levels of complexity. He said that more often than not in the long arc of evolution, that reintegration of diversity at higher levels of complexity, happens through collaborative processes, whether this is two long nucleated cells and one engulfing the other and forming nucleated cells, the endless symbiosis theory and what that made possible in terms of multicellular organism and most of higher life forms being based on nucleated cells.",

Do you agree that we might have, in evolutionary theory and also in education around biology and evolution, have somewhat over focused on competition as a driving force in evolution and have undervalued the ocean of symbiosis and collaboration that actually underlies that when you zoom out and you take a systems view of life [inaudible 00:02:09]?",

          "text": "Absolutely, absolutely. But first let me say that I really like Stewart’s way of describing evolution and the emphasis on cooperation makes total sense because it is actually impolite in the diversification. If you understand life as a network, then biodiversity means higher complexity of the network, more connections. Since this living network is a network of processes of metabolic and cognitive processes and ecological processes, every new connection can be seen as a cooperation. Connections are cooperations and greater diversity means more cooperation, or if the cooperation lacks, of course, it means breakdown. Then you have this situation like we have in our political world where we have prejudice in groups fighting each other and distinguishing between us and them, the me and the other. That is the lack of cooperation, but nature, nonhuman nature, that doesn’t work like that. It cooperates, but basically.",

Random mutations are only part of evolution. Bacteria can mutate very fast and multiply very fast, but they have another way of changing the genome. That is by a horizontal gene transfer. They trade genes. They spill out. The bacterium will in day to day, in its day to day life, it will spill out a certain proportion of its genes and other bacteria will absorb it. There’s a constant trading of genes to the extent that some microbiologists think that one should not talk about species of bacteria, because the genome is so fluid and always changing that you can’t define species.",

The second avenue evolution is the gene trading and the third avenue of evolution is something that Lynn Margulis popularized and built a theory around. That’s symbiosis. There are two organisms living in close proximity to the extent that they ended up completely, depending on one another and forming a new organism. For example, the chloroplasts in plant cells that contain the chlorophyll and are essential for the synthesis were originally individual bacteria that invaded the cell and then became comfortable there and collaborated cooperated with the plant cell. You have these three avenues of evolution, genetic random mutation, which it’s not that random either, but let’s not get into that. It becomes too complicated. Random, well, let me just say that an organism can control the amount of randomness. The random mutation is based on a copying arrow of the DNA and the arrow.",

As we’ve come to understand, it is a cognitive process because according to the so-called Santiago theory of cognition about which I’ve written a lot, the very essential dynamics of self organization is cognitive.

I may have got that phrase from Hazel Henderson, the radical economist, who is an old friend of mine. What we are talking about here is a very profound change of worldview that has been happening over the last half century and longer, the change of paradigms, essentially from seeing the world as a machine, to understanding it as a network. A network, of course, is a pattern of relationships and therefore, in order to understand networks, we need to understand patterns and relationships. That’s what systems thinking is all about. That’s why I call the new paradigm is systemic or systems view of the world. This has a profound effect on all our activities and endeavors, professionally and personally, because what we’re dealing with in our personal and professional lives is usually living systems.",

What this theory says is that the dynamics of organizational of self organization, of living organisms or any living systems is essentially a cognitive process. This is a great expansion of the view of cognition. Cognition is the self organizing activity of living systems. When an organism perceives something, that stimulus, that disturbance as Marturano calls it, will enter the organism and the organism will respond to it with certain structural changes, according to its nature. The environment triggers the response, triggers the structural changes, but doesn’t determine them. The organism actually selects what to notice and what not to notice.",

These patterns of complex education also then in local pockets, need breakdown of ossified structures that no longer serve in order to unleash the possibility for new connections. In your book, The Systems View of Life, you have two sub chapters. One of them ask the question, what is life? Then you also asked the question, what is death?

When an organism dies, the DNA doesn’t disappear, it’s just a molecule and it stays there. The difference between the living and the dead organism or living and the nonliving organism is the process of flight is what poets and philosophers for ages have called the breath of life. In modern scientific language, the breath of life is called metabolism. This is something I learned also from Lynn Margulis.

Then the network aspect was developed by Marturana and Varela, who discovered that the key characteristic of these living networks is that there are cells generating self producing, self making. They’re calling the Greek term, which literally means self making that’s autopoiesis. These autopoietic networks continually regenerate themselves, replace their structures, transform their structures and regenerate themselves. You must like that very much because you have written this book about regenerative cultures and regeneration, is a term that has become very popular lately thanks partly to your work.

He was at the jet propulsion laboratories at the time and in the office next to him, data, new data came in from radio spectrometry or something of the atmospheric compositions of all the other planets.",

Then if you look at Gaia, there’s a stark disequilibrium that makes life possible. At that moment, he basically almost got himself out of a job by basically saying, “We don’t need to design more instruments. We don’t need to send anybody up. I can tell you that there isn’t any life there because the process of life is what creates the disequilibrium.”",

It’s a pattern of self organization, of self generation, of regeneration. Death is the breaking of that pattern. That pattern may break all of a sudden when somebody has a car accident and dies on the spot or a stroke or a heart attack, or what is much more common, the pattern may break slowly.

The stomach lining, for instance, changes completely within 24 hours or something like this. Other tissues have a rapid turnover of cells. This constant self-renewal is the very essence of life. Well, if you look at it from the point of view of the cell, it’s a cycle of life and death. What is life and death at one level is the very essence of life at the higher level.
