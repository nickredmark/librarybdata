The natural region, with its characteristic local variations, could be saved only through a new (actually very old) kind of urban and regional planning conceived as an instrument of a civic-minded social order. Planning for ecological regionalism required cultural and political renewal” (Luccarelli, 1995, p.1).",

The catalytic role of wide-spread ecoliteracy and an ecologically conscious citizenry in the transformation towards a sustainable human civilization calls for many more such public intellectuals to bridge the gap between academia and the rest of civil society.

These two projects — the investigation of the conception of self in American culture and the inquiry into the origins and prospects of regionalism — formed the basis for Mumford’s work. The former led him to investigate the social and aesthetic implications of contrasting conceptions of subjectivity; the latter required the investigation of geography and the uses of new technologies and planning to effect a different kind of geographic order: the re-creation of a regional geography.\n … The cultivation of the experience of place shaped Mumford’s interest in regionalism as a cultural vision. And he connected this cultural project to a civic politics necessary to support regional planning” (Luccarelli, 1995, pp.20–21).",

For Mumford, the ‘container’ must stand in creative relation to its ‘contents’ — the human society that inhabits it — in a way that permits “organic complexity” …. The most important lesson to be drawn from the garden city pertains to its vision of “place.” … the larger issue is the importance of an aesthetic- moral perspective that informs the creation of real communities. When made part of a planner’s vision, a sense of “place” fosters interaction between residence and work and between the built environment and the natural region (Luccarelli, 1995, p.210).",

For Mumford such ecotechnics would create healthy environments in which nature as well as the human body and mind can flourish.
