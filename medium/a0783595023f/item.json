Holling published the first results of his studies of the complex dynamics of change within ecosystems.

Too much disturbance could lead to systemic degeneration, but at the same time periodic disturbance (within limits) could also contribute to an ecosystem’s transformation to a more diverse and more vibrant dynamic equilibrium condition.",

To do so, we need the right balance between persistent/adaptive resilience and transformative resilience in our Socio-Ecological-Systems.
