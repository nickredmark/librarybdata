Whether we finally acknowledge the equal rights of women which have been denied historically in so many places and are still being denied in many but are gradually improving in most places. Or whether we are looking at the strong movement in all walks of life to find ways of organizing institutions and workplaces so that the combined contributions of all involved are honoured and synergistic, while benefits are shared more equitably. There are many examples that we are beginning to recognize our unity in multiplicity, celebrate our diversity, and are doing so with a deeper human solidarity. We are not all the same, and yet, we have the same rights and responsibilities as participants in the community of life!",

A modernization of the welfare state has taken place through private initiatives over the last 40 years. Cohousing communities, especially for the elderly, and intentional communities have sprung up in great numbers in Denmark [and many other places] and are spreading to the whole world.",
