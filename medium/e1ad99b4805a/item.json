          "text": "Agile methods have gained widespread adoption in software development, because they perform better. In many sectors, software projects had become so complex and unmanageable, that something had to give. There were too many layers of complexity. Some of the complexity was associated with the nature of the task itself — computational and cognitive complexity. Much of the complexity had to do with how people organized themselves to face that complexity. There were excessive layers of bureaucratic, management and administrative “fat” that were in the way. Information that was authorized at the top and flowed downhill further complexified the situation. Top tier managers made decisions based on systems thinking and sophisticated abstractions that had little to do with what was actually needed in developing software. Information flows were subject to hierarchical filtering — practices that essentially gutted anything that didn’t already fit into their models.",

For the hackers, however, the advantages of agile seemed obvious and inevitable.",

          "text": "When agile moves into a big organization, it trims off organizational fat, and shreds its way through managerial control. It creates modular and iterative approaches to software development and emphasizes respectful human interaction and the power of teamwork. Agile methods prioritize refactoring or scrapping old code that has grown unwieldy over time from lack of diligence and care. Higher up the organization, agile exerts pressure on leadership to migrate crucial steps in decision-making from centralized policy wonks drawn from the professional managerial pool, to workers who are skilled in key operational activities and representative of the culture and values of the local contexts in which they work. In these local contexts, a quiet revolution happens. Ordinary people become less concerned with status and more concerned with doing good work while focusing on creating value — two key concerns they now share with their customers. Armed with a sense of collaboration, camaraderie and purpose, these “ordinary people” consistently make better choices.",

He continued his research for more than a decade, mapping sensemaking practices across different fields such as forest fighting, aviation, aricraft carrier flight control and infectious disease control. He identified key features of sensemaking in HROs (highly reliable organizations) and crucial fault lines in sensemaking that lead to disaster in times of crisis. In 2011, Kobus Ehlers wrote a thesis incorporating Weick’s research and re-interpreting agile software development as managed sensemaking. The seeds of a new integration and future of agile have already been substantially, albeit academically, authored. It is now time to implement these ideas.",
