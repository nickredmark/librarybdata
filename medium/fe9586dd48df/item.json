The logic of burning hundreds of millions of years of fossil energy in a little over a hundred years cannot stand up to rigorous intellectual consideration. Making selfish, wasteful, and toxic decisions leads to predictable catastrophic outcomes. We are forced to face the accumulated results of choices made by generations of those who came before us, to see how we became complicit and to adjust our own behavior. As each of us realizes that we are part of an eternal continuum and are simply passing through, we are called to analyze the past, the present, and the future, and to do our best.

We know that, over 4 billion years ago, the new Earth was a hot and not very welcoming place. Over geologic time, the original materials weathered, creating sedimentary layers that can be seen, analyzed, and measured. Over evolutionary time, three primary trends asserted themselves to transform the earth into a beautiful garden. The rst of these trends was the total colonization of the planet by biological life. The second trend was the differentiation and speciation leading to in nite potential variety in genetics, and the third was the constant accumulation of organic matter as each generation of life died and gave up its body to nurture the next generation.",

This is also the basis of respiration, which has naturally created, ltered, and renewed the hydrologic cycle. These trends have created the living, fertile, organic soils in which microbial communities have built their habitat. These primary producers participate in the cycle of life by making minerals from geologic materials available for plant and animals and recycling nutrients as each generation of life gives up its body to nurture the next.

In 2006, a vehicle I was riding in rounded a corner on a road in the Rwandan highlands, revealing a small stream emerging from the forest. Asking the driver to stop, I got out of the jeep and heard the insistent sound of water owing. My young companions were not moved by the scene and protested that we should continue to the capital, but I was older, willful, and nominally in charge, so I ignored them. While they loitered along the road, I pushed aside the vines and began to follow the stream into the forest. Without a path, it was not easy going, but in a short while I was balancing on the slippery rocks at the source. The scene was unforgettable. The sound of the clear water was like gentle laughter as it owed naturally out of the earth. The stream swirled around rocks, causing delicate mosses to dance in the current. Beautiful orchids exuding an intoxicating fragrance streamed from the trees, while hundreds of delicate butter ies uttered about.",

It is possible to conclude from evolutionary theory that human beings emerged in paradise. This is also what it says in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic cosmology. Almost all indigenous people’s cosmologies state that all life is sacred — that life is a representation of the divine. I nd it fascinating that our cosmologies and science are saying the same thing. The next part of the cosmology says that human beings sinned and were expelled from paradise. We need to consider this very carefully.",

These mistakes taken over time have altered carbon uptake during photosynthesis, reduced the natural fertility of the soil, and massively changed the infiltration and retention of water in the soil and below the vegetative canopy, disrupting the natural regulation of weather, temperature, and climate.",

We’ve been distracted from life by the petty rituals of our society and our economy, that brazenly suggest they are more important than the air we breathe or the water we drink. For the most part, we acquiesce, accepting the super cial in our inability to comprehend the profound. Ultimately, we all must face the limited nature of our short stay on Earth and realize that time will march on after we have left the scene. We will know more then, but why wait? There are mysteries that are better savored over a lifetime than swallowed whole when we are about to die. The more we contemplate and process the meaning of our lives, the better able we are to live them.",

This spurs some to believe that if we destroy the earth, we can simply fly off to another planet and plunder that one. We can also see this in the desire of some to build grand follies, which will stand as monuments to hubris long after the builder has left this life. The unconscious legacies that the egotist does not envision are the massive impact of extraction and energy use and the ensuing pollution and degradation. The shiny objects seen in nite time are the rubble strewn through the trash heap of our history, and over evolutionary time the reduction of the very processes we depend on for life.",

You can read Designing Regenerative Cultures as if the future depended on our understanding this because the future of human civilization will be decided by whether we can transform this profound discussion into collective human consciousness and collective human action.",
