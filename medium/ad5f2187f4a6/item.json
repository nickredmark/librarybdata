It is no secret that we are in the midst of a severe period of ecological collapse. The exploding human population lay flat on its growth curve for hundreds of thousands of years until the invention of industrial agriculture. Then it shot skyward in an exponential arc corresponding with the rapid depletion of intact ecosystems, healthy environments, and stored materials across the Earth.

Yet rarely do these conversations go deeply enough into the ecology of our species to see how profoundly unsustainable this growth arc has always been. Ecologists like William Catton Jr. in his classic text Overshoot have called the period of exponential growth for any species the “exuberant” phase. It is quickly followed by a peak and subsequent collapse. Those of us who study history will recognize that the Great Myth of Progress arose in Western Civilization just as it was embodying the most brutal forms of colonial expansion into the Americas. Terms like manifest destiny and self-reliance were blended within the microspheres of this macroscopic pattern, blinding many to the ecological limits of the Earth that were soon (in geologic terms) to be leapt beyond in a giant pulse of destabilization.",

What are the conditions of thriving that enable this particular kind of tree to live in this particular kind of environment? In our case as the last surviving remnants of the hominid family tree, the secret to our success has been the ability to create cultural niches that alter our environments to serve the needs of our own kind. Joseph Henrich wrote a book summarizing what the science of cultural evolution has to say about human uniqueness — appropriately titled The Secret of Our Success: How Culture is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter — that was published in 2015. The main takeaway was that humans create cultural patterns of change that can build upon that which came before. We create social niches that act as a kind of scaffolding to build our way into novel environments. And we do so in ways that accentuate the role of culture in the double bind of biological constraint with ecological limits coupled to the potential for compounding of exponential change in our cultural developmental pathways.",

I write these words in late July of 2020 as globalized humanity struggles to grapple with a pandemic that exemplifies this point. We created giant population centers in our great cities and connected them with each other using fossil fuel technologies to create international airports. This enabled a network of connectivity to grow that is prided for its creativity and innovation. Yet it is the very same connectivity that allowed ecological destruction of nonhuman habits to give birth to a virus that could jump on those same airplanes to consume the bodies of people all over the planet in the span of a few short weeks.",

It is in its death throes right now. There are zero historical antecedents to suggest it might miraculously survive. All empires and civilizations arose during a brief period of warm, stable climate known as the Holocene. All of them also collapsed and went away.

They built their homes with local materials, gathered what would be woven into their clothes with knowledge of local animals and plants, invested their innovative talents in the use of these capacities in their regional landscapes, and achieved resilience by trading with neighboring tribes who did the same thing.

There was always something shared at the pattern-level. Each region was striving to build soils and diversify production with agroforestry and regenerative farming. Each region was seeking to partner with its indigenous past to bridge the gap wrought by extractive economies to enable the restoration of human institutions to manage affairs in the recovery of that which had been polluted, degraded, or destroyed.",

There is a real hunger for honesty about the predicament we are in and the need for viable pathways into the future that actually can work for creating the conditions of human thriving for long-term resilience. A key insight alluded to above is that bioregional economies organize themselves around the functions of landscapes. They structure their material flows to the local ecology, geology, shape and structure, of the land itself. This means human culture is nested within watersheds and mountain ranges, coastal estuaries and alluvial floodplains. These territorial characteristics are linked in scale to larger structures that shape weather patterns and entire continents. The Andes running north to south for several thousand miles. The Himalayas holding water in thousands of glaciers to feed dozens of major river systems. The great plains of North America and Africa with dynamic movements of large animals across grasslands that regenerate the soil.",

          "text": "Those of use lucky enough to become ancestors in this dangerous period of planetary overshoot will be the ones who recognize that all sustainable cultures — human or otherwise — are organized around the functions of living landscapes. They are bioregional through and through. This is like going down Alice’s rabbit hole to discover a labyrinth of solutions hidden from sight. The majority of people alive today are in cities. They work for corporations. Their job is to create financial returns. Their survival depends on global supply chains and stable climatic zones. This majority of people will not survive what is coming. They are not organized bioregionally and do not have the ecological training to know how to live in the landscapes they currently inhabit.",

Are you dead sunlight re-animated by burning fossil fuels that will walk steadfast into collapse unaware of your true condition in this larger pattern? Or will you learn to see that a pattern of thriving can be found that is far from your perceptions of normal in these extremely bizarre and unprecedented times that all of us were born into? I do not ask these questions lightly. My wife and I chose with eyes wide open to birth a child. Our daughter is going to turn four in a few months. And we are doing all that we can to organize our lives around a bioregion in serious need of regeneration in the Northern Andes of Colombia where we have recently staked a claim in the land and call this our new home.",

We are living in a landscape devoid of ancestral humans. The indigenous Guane people were driven to cultural extinction 500 years ago when the Conquistadors arrived to set up these systems of economic extraction. We are living in a landscape on its way to becoming a desert. The cycling of water and nutrients no longer flow in the soils after the forests went away.",

A reforestation effort began ten years ago in the Móncora Bioparque that is a community food forest and teaching ground for the people who will take on this vital work. Many of the campesino farmers have already organized themselves into cooperatives so they can help each other survive. A rich culture of earthen construction, use of natural fibers to make baskets and clothing, and other aspects of subsistence living remain intact here in this remote mountain town. We can see inklings of survival for these people who raised their children a generation ago during the 57 year civil war that wrought violence upon Colombia and made it far easier to extract local wealth while the locals themselves were too poorly organized to stop it from happening.",

Most were not aware that it must be bioregional systems that take the place of this globalized system as it kills itself. How many more will die before this secret of sustainability becomes widely shared?",
