His professional work spans the entire history of humanity’s slow process of waking up to looming ecological collapse and climate cataclysm. He is the inventor of a number of ecological engineering patents and has pioneered integrated ecological design solutions in food production, wastewater treatment, bioremediation of polluted water and soils, architecture, marine transport, energy production and landscape restoration.",

One of John’s long standing but yet unrealized visions is to build a series of “ecological hope ships for marine pollution reduction” called ‘Ocean Restorers’. These ships would be catamarans with their “treatment technologies suspended between the two hulls.”",

Water would be circulated between them using wind or solar energy.” John continues: “When the job is done, the environmental clean up technologies can be conversted to commercial fish farming. When natural springs have returned to the landscape, as they undoubtably will, they can be employed to support trout culture. Ponds, designed to capture and hold rain water, could support the cultivation of catfish and buffalo fish. By this time the biomass tree plantations will be at peak production. The orchards and vineyards in the sixteenth year will be producing bountiful harvests and will employ an increasing number of local people. Valuable nut trees, such as walnuts, will be managed for timber, as well as their nuts. Livestock including cattle, sheep, and pigs will be part of the landscape and will graze in rotation amongst the tree-dappled pastures” (p.148–149).",
