Even though I know every word of the book almost by heart, it remains a ‘go-to’ read and is a battered and dog-eared friend from many, many re-reads.",

It is planetary in scope and gigantic in its ambition for our species.",

It lays out a pathway of inquiry that has the potential to help us build a regenerative economy out of the ashes of our current degenerative one.",

This is the work of years of study of many other equally insightful theorists and practitioners which combine in Daniel’s own unique insights. Dig into one chapter and you will find the perfect intervention to help you share a more regenerative way of designing innovation. Open the next and you will find provoking questions that are as yet without answer, but which stimulate the reader’s curiosity and creativity. It’s a way of living through some of the most important questions we should all be asking ourselves today.",

It is for those who are ready to think, learn and act. What I love most about this book is that it doesn’t just address the technical process of changing systems like many sustainability or management tomes. Nor like many books on developmental psychology, does it seek to focus solely on the human element of change. It just paints a vision of what is possible if we take inspiration for the oldest system on the planet — life itself — through a process of inquiry in which the reader can then find their own way forward.",

Keep at it when your eyebrows raise or your eyes cross at something that is at first hard to understand. It will reward you. It made my grey cells crispy around the edges at times, but I learned and gained important knowledge.",

I would love to see it in an online format with millions on interconnected mychorrizal threads — that I could dive into and just journey through them all. Perhaps one day the likes of Kumu will allow us to do just that. I would be delighted if I could stick on a virtual reality helmet and ‘see’ my way through its tunnels and caves.",

If it hadn’t been for this book my own path might have continued to be resolutely corporate. If it hadn’t been for this book I might have found ideas like bioregionalism for societal transformation much later than I did. It has helped me expand my horizons, improve my practice, and helped me experiment in areas of local/regional regenerative design I would never have thought possible.

If you have any interest at all in design, systems thinking, nature, how we could intentionally and meaningful go about changing the shape of our degenerative economies into regenerative, life-giving instead of life-depleting, economies — this is a must read and a go-to resource.
