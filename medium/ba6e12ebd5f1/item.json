At this level art becomes the interpreter of the mysteries of the world just as science is also, in a different sense”(Steiner, 1988).",

Modern research science has a lot to learn from this understanding. Bortoft (1996) emphasiezes that rather than conflicting with each other, Goethe’s and Newton’s theories of colour simply represent very distinct approaches to the phenomenon of colour. “For Goethe was primarily interested in a phenomenological theory of color that was holistic and accounted for the qualities of color experience, as well as being based on a systematic set of experiments and observations (Goodwin, 1999).",

The ‘marriage’ of art and science, science and spirituality, body and mind, mind and matter, reason and intuition is what Goethe tried to participate in and embody during his lifetime. It is a mystical ‘marriage’, akin to the marriage of Sun and Moon, the ‘chemical wedding’ of alchemy. “By bringing the universal male and female principles together in a Chemical Wedding the alchemist is trying to recover the original unity of the world” (Marshall, 2001). I believe that Goethe was deeply engaged in this process and the mysticism expressed through words and pictures he refers to can be found in the symbolic pictures and writings of the alchemical tradition. Gebelein writes: “An expansion of science seems to be necessary, an expansion which re-attributes meaning to qualities. In such a science the boundaries between science and mysticism would dissolve. The unification of these perceived opposites has always been the intention of alchemy” (Gebelein, 2000).",

Holistic science emphasizes that the whole is more than simply the sum of its parts. Everything is contained in this dynamically emergent whole. This overcomes the separation of the observer and the observed, the scientist and so-called ‘objective reality’. The illusory and fictitious existence of which has formed the assumptive basis for the kind of science that is dominating Western civilisation and more recently our entire planet.",

The syllabus for the Masters in Holistic Science includes topics such as: Chaos theory, Gaia theory and Complexity theory. The common theme is a focus on emergent properties, self-organisation and self-regulation in complex, interconnected systems, which are regarded as fundamentally unpredictable, yet can be made intelligible. In the philosophy of science we look at epistemology, hermeneutics, phenomenology, multiplicity of truth and the co-emergence of the self and the world, as well as the historical shift in world-view, which occurred during the ‘scientific revolution’. Furthermore, there is a strong emphasis on qualities alongside the common quantitative approach and on the participatory nature of this new way of science.",

Imagination becomes the means for investigating the phenomenon itself and not what goes on behind the phenomenon, like in atomism. The phenomenon ceases to be an object standing over and against consciousness and the phenomenon begins to appear in consciousness, instead of appearing to it.” He argued that the existing “ontological gulf” between science and its object is a fundamental prerequisite of Reductionist science, as it allows for a science of measuring and experimenting, in which an “object appears to consciousness, it does not appear in consciousness” (Bortoft, 2001). I would add that it is precisely this ‘ontological gulf’, which enables the moral and ethical detachment with which modern science continues to evade responsibility for its participation in bringing about the current environmental, social and economic crisis, we observe worldwide.",

The phenomenon becomes more and more visible” (Bortoft, 2001). To him, Goethe’s main achievement lies not in specific discoveries that he made, but in Goethe’s whole way of seeing.

Newton drew on this knowledge extensively and in the mindset of the emerging mechanistic worldview, with its quantitative focus, sided with Mephistopheles and accepted the Cartesian mind-body split. Goethe on the other hand stayed true to the tradition of alchemy, which “refuses to separate the mind from the body; indeed, it seeks the embodiment of the spirit, and the spiritualization of the body”(Marshall, 2001).",
