In this totality, the atomistic form of insight is a simplification and an abstraction, valid only in some limited context.”53 While this agreement has existed since the beginning of the last century, most of current science is still based on a Newtonian and atomistic conception of the world.",

As we explore time’s fractal details, microevents flood in on us full of nuances hardly noticed before, while at the same time we sense the flow of faster and slower waves of time — the movement of the sun across the sky, the warming of the Earth, the growth of a seed, the aging of trees….”75",

It would therefore be better to replace the word system with the word process to give a clearer indication of the dynamic non-linear causalities involved and stress the inevitability of participation and thus responsibility. This may help to avoid obscuring our new form of understanding by falling into old paradigm habits of mechanistic thought, motivated by issues of power and aimed at control and prediction to achieve some form of competitive advantage.",
