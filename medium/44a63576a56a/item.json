Day regards present place as past-formed. He believes that “if we dismiss the old and only value the new and exciting, we devalue our present selves. For the past, its traditions and knowledge, heritage and continuum, embodies who we were, so how we’ve come to be as we are. Like wise if we only value the past, dismissing the future, we devalue everything that inspires us to make the world a better place — and more than this we deny life.”156 Day believes that we have to take both the wisdom of tradition, the intimate local knowledge of a place into account, as well as create visions for the future through a participatory approach to design.

In making an argument for the appropriateness of local scale and the importance of meeting human needs within the boundaries and limits of their local environment, one is often misunderstood as advertising a return to the narrow-minded localism of the past, but this is not what I argue for. I simply believe that in order to design for humanity’s appropriate participation in the processes of life, we have to integrate the need of a particular local culture to the matter and energy flows of its local environment and rely as little as possible on far-flung ecological subsidies.",

Global and local, though polarities, aren’t mutually exclusive. In our global world, the challenge is to be local, be in the place in which you are now.
