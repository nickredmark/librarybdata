Training on complication is a major problem with our educational system. And, of course, in the next few decades, AI is going to show up everywhere.",

It seems challenging for us to think clearly about anything at all — much less something as nuanced and tricky as this. Well, it seems highly unlikely that things are going to get better all by themselves. So I hope that we are able to muster the clarity and conviction to take responsibility for this world that we have built — while there is still time to do so.",
