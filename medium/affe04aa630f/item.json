They wanted to know what is required for a beginner to reproduce the same outcomes as an advanced practitioner for a task that is difficult to do. The technique they chose to study was one that our distant ancestors had to master well before anatomically modern humans came on the scene — the “flaking” of stone to produce a spear tip like the ones found more than 2 million years ago as part of the Oldowan Tradition for Homo habilis. Modern-day variations on this technique have been observed in hunter-gatherer societies to take roughly five years of guided instruction before they are mastered.",
