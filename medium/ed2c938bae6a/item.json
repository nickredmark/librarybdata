These were my formative years, I was in my 20s. I graduated in physics at the University of Vienna and in 65, and then had my first postdoc appointments. I was very much influenced by the cultural movements of the 1960s and looking back now, I can say that there were two main cultural movements. Both of them had to do with an expansion of consciousness, an expansion of consciousness in two different directions. Into the spiritual dimension of consciousness and into the social dimension. So, in the spiritual dimension, you had a very strong interest in meditation, in Eastern spirituality, in indigenous spirituality. With the books of Castaneda for example, and this was supported by the arts, by music, by literature.",

That was really very characteristic of the 60s and of course there was experimentation with psychedelics. So, all of that combined to a very strong expansion of consciousness into the spiritual domain. Then, there was the social consciousness, raising as it was called in those days. That I see essentially as a very broad questioning of authority. So, we had the civil rights movement in the United States, questioning the authority of whites over blacks. We had the women’s movement questioning patriarchal authority, the student movements questioning the authority of teachers and university administrators, the Prague Spring and the Dubcek, questioning the authority of the Soviet regime. Again, this was supported by the arts, the films of Antonioni Fellini, Korda and so on. Theater played a big role, the living theater, for example. So, I was very much influenced by all that and in the 1970s, I first went into the spiritual dimension in my work. Exploring parallels between modern physics and Eastern spirituality. In my first book, The Tao of Physics published in 1975.",

Sometime, between the late 70s and early 80s, I realized that all these problems had to do with life.

So, I realized that these issues all had to do with living systems, with individual organisms, social systems and ecosystems. So, my focus shifted from physics to the life sciences, because physics, although it’s relevant, but it really can’t tell you anything about the essential nature of life. So that’s, what I became interested in and then for the next 30 years, I put together a synthesis of an emerging new conception of life. In terms of networks, in terms of patterns, in terms of relationships and already in my book, the Turning Point, I called this, The Systems View of Life. At the end of this trajectory, is a textbook that I wrote with my friend and colleague Pier Luigi Luisi a biochemist at the University of Rome, and we called it The Systems View of Life. This is for me, my grand synthesis of this new conception of life, which integrates four dimensions of life. The biological dimension, obviously, but also the cognitive dimension, the social dimension and the ecological dimension.",

By the arts theater, music, all of that, right now, there seems to be another upsurge of issues or like that.

It’s not a broad trajectory toward a different society, different economics, different culture. I came to see it more like a pendulum, but not irregular pendulum, a chaotic pendulum. This is something we studied in chaos theory, this is a pendulum that is highly irregular, unpredictable, and goes back and forth, but never in the same way. So, we had the early inspiration, the change of awareness in the 1960s and 1970s. We had the political manifestation in green politics and in the 1980s. I believed towards the end of the 1980s, that we were now ready to embrace this new vision of reality, and embody it politically, and really change the world. Well, what happened then was something totally unforeseen, which nobody had predicted and that was the information technology revolution. Which led among many other things to a new materialism really and of course a new global economy. Which was and is dominated by corporations, and brought with it materialism, and greed, very much the opposite of the values we had developed in the 60s, and 70s.",

You and I today, and even more so younger people live in a networked world, in a globally networked world. So, we were very excited about that, but the shadow side is the corporate economy. Which is, geared toward exploitation and toward shifting wealth as the occupy movements at the 99% to, to the 1%. So in 1999, there was the meeting of the WTO, The World Trade Organization in Seattle. Where a new global civil society emerged and so now we have two main forces. We have the corporate world, the corporate economy, and we have the global civil society, and they are on a collision course. The crisis, that I described and foresaw in the Turning Point in the late 70s, has now intensified. Of course, it has been exacerbated by climate change, really climate breakdown. Which we also foresaw, I wrote about climate change or global warming as it was called then in 1988.",

I met Havel in 1997, when he invited me to a symposium called forum 2000 and I’ve been very much inspired by something he wrote when he was a dissident and was actually in prison. It is a meditation on hope where Havel sees hope, as he says, “As a dimension of the soul and not as the result of an assessment of the situation in the world.” Let me read to you what he writes, “Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out.” So, I’ve tried to live like that, I’ve been very inspired by that.",

There’s still so few institutions in the world that actually really focus on that education, that is now so needed. You co-founded the Center for Ecoliteracy and spent a long time actually looking at how do we start through education to create this mind shift. We first met at Schumacher College in 2001.

Integrating the biological, the cognitive, the social and the ecological. It consists of 12 prerecorded lectures of about 40 minutes and they were recorded for some reason in Brazil. In the home of an architect, a beautiful living room with a very small group of participants. I can tell you, I don’t know whether you realize this watching the lectures. That this is really modeled after Schumacher College, because when you see people sitting on the floor and on couches in this intimate environment discussing things. That’s what I’ve done with people at Schumacher College for 20 years. So, I modeled my lectures after that and in addition to the lectures, there’s a discussion forum. `",

We have so many alumni now, that we have alumni meetings on Zoom, like you and I have right now. But also, face to face because whenever I travel somewhere I meet alumni. Whether they go to Italy or to Austria, or to London or to Sweden, I have alumni meetings and I don’t need to be there.

But, the one way of influencing emergence in a way that it is more likely to be positive properties, that emerge rather than negative ones. Is to pay attention to whose connected to whom in the system and the quality of the connections. Also, what information flows in the system and the quality of the information. What I hear you doing with this course, is actually building a network of global systems thinkers that are imbued and understand the systems view of life.

Actually Satish himself gave me this beautiful image of saying, “It doesn’t really matter.” The ecological view of life, the systems view of life and spirituality are really sides of the same coin. You can go into the door of spirituality and if you really go deep into our interbeing and interconnection with life, you ended up learning about ecology. The other option is you go in as a scientist, and you go deep into ecology, and the systemic interconnection, and a complex dynamic system that is constantly transforming. Suddenly you have insights that are deeply spiritual insights.",
