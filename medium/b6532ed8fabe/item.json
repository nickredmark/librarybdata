People just said, I want a damn Clio, and they went for it. And that is why I am happy right now. I got this. I didn’t really win it, but I got it.

Carefully designed to get behind the habits and senses that tell us what we need and what is good for us and, rather than actually give us what we need, give us some “empty calories.” Duping our senses so thoroughly that we loose track of the possibility of authenticity and quality. Leaving us full, but not fulfilled.",

Its not a matter of regulating advertising or of attempting to shame the industry into better behaviour. The answer is simpler: we are going to render it obsolete.

Arguably, this is the function that advertising (or “marketing communications”) was supposed to fulfill. If we are to be free of advertising for good, we need some way to quickly, easily and confidently get to the most satisfying experiences and the best solutions to our problems.",
