This alchemical touchstone idea holds the intention that the book would leave the reader somehow transformed after reading it. I am not sure whether I achieved this high aim, but the reviews that have been coming in from different corners of the world and from many of my most important mentors and teachers, seem to suggest the book is a contribution to the Great Work: “the transition from the industrial growth society to a life-sustaining society” as Joanna Macy and David Korton have called it, or the change from the ‘story of separation’ to the ‘story of interbeing’ as Charles Eisenstein has put it.",

We need to become more visible to those who have not yet realised that there is a way to learn more about how ‘to be the change we want to see in the world’, how to co-create thriving communities and local economies, how to become a global-local change agent and contribute to the Great Work.",

Share the stories of your experiences, insights and the projects that might have been informed by — or even born out of — the inspiration you might have felt on those courses and with your community of learners.
