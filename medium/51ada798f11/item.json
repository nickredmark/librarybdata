The fossil-fuel savings account has been put aboard Spaceship Earth for the exclusive function of getting the new machinery built with which to support life and humanity at ever more effective standards of vital physical energy and reinspiring metaphysical sustenance to be sustained exclusively on our Sun’s radiation and Moon’s pull … We cannot afford to expend our fossil fuels faster than we are ‘recharging our battery,’ which means precisely the rate at which the fossil fuels are being continually deposited within Earth’s spherical crust. We have discovered that it is highly feasible for all human passengers aboard Spaceship Earth to enjoy the whole ship without any individual interfering with another and without any individual being advanced at the expense of another, providing that we are not so foolish as to burn up our ship and its operating equipment by powering our prime operations exclusively on atomic reactor generated energy.

Nature is not to be conquered or opposed, but she is to be regarded as a model of applied principles: Nature always does things in the most efficient and economic way.

The term itself is an amalgamation of the words ‘synergy’ and ‘energetic’. While synergy is referring to the “performance of the whole unpredicted by an examination of the parts or any subassembly of the parts,” the word “energetic refers to energetic geometry.” Fuller recognizes that the entire universe is interrelated and in constant motion or transformation. Therefore describing the world within the three dimensional confines of the Cartesian grid system of x, y, and z axis, omitted at least one dimension: time. Fuller explained: “In fact, experiment shows that we see and comprehend very little of the totality of motion. Therefore society tends to think statically and is always being surprised, often uncomfortably, sometimes fatally.” He emphasized that “lacking dynamic apprehension it is difficult for humanity to get out of its static fixations and specifically to see the great trends evolving” (in Baldwin, 1996, p.69).

Scientists do. Also, fortunately, we have discovered nature’s coordinate system, which is elegantly simple and popularly comprehensible.

Baldwin explains: “no insubstantial points, straight lines, or infinite planes are employed. Synergetic mathematics is based on experience rather than physically impossible axioms.” Synergetics presupposes that “everything physical must have a shape and structure,” which according to Fuller follow certain laws. “Synergetics describes and models those laws. Like angles, they are unchanged by scale. In physics, synergetics explains the apparent paradox of electromagnetic phenomena being both wave and particle. In design, synergetics reduces or eliminates compromise” (Baldwin, 1996, p.69). A full exploration of synergetics certainly goes beyond the scope of this thesis. The intention here is to highlight its potential significance in the challenge of re-thinking and re-designing the human presence in the world. Synergetics may yet prove to become an important tool for the emerging natural design movement.",

For a more in depth, but nevertheless easily understandable introduction into Buckminster Fuller’s synergetics, I will have to refer the reader to J. Baldwin’s book.

Humans were the most powerful (known) antientropic forces of all, because we accumulate and purvey knowledge, adding local order to Universe in the same way that a plant synthesises air, sunlight, and soil nutrients into botanical life. Bucky’s definition of Universe did not permit the discouraging concept of an overall entropic ‘winding down’ into total disorderliness. There is always a building-up of orderliness someplace else in nonsimulatneous Universe. Because anti-entropy is a double negative, Bucky called it ‘syntropy’. Our purpose and duty as humans is to be syntropic” (Baldwin, 1996, pp.226–227).",

Baldwin explains that Fuller “considered now to be the Dark Ages compared to what we could accomplish.” He suggests that Fuller “worked 50 years ahead to give us some of the tools we would need to ‘graduate’ into being a wholly successful species.” Fuller believed that “nature is trying to make us a success, that nature is readying us for an important function.” In his old age Fuller tried to educate a critical mass of people to recognize and take advantage of humanity’s potential for synergy.” He was in hopeful expectation of a necessary and immanent design science revolution (Baldwin, 1996, p.227).",

The paragraph is worth re-reading, as it expresses in his words what I refer to, throughout this thesis, as appropriate participation in natural process, the essence of sustainable, salutogenic, scale-linking and natural design. Appropriate participation in natural process and salutogenesis as guiding principles for design is what Fuller called acting “in support of integrity of eternally regenerative Universe” (see below).",

If the realistic thinking can conceive of technically feasible options facilitating satisfactorily effective human fulfilment of its designed functioning as local Universe information inventorying and local Universe problem-solving in support of the integrity of eternally regenerative Universe, then the accomplishment of that realistic conceptioning is realistically effective in satisfying Universe that human mind is accomplishing its designed evolutionary role” (Fuller, 1981, p.47)",

          "text": "In Fuller’s understanding of the Universe, “there are no solids. There are no things. There are only interfering and noninterfering patterns operative in pure principle, and principles are eternal.” His understanding or what constitutes a principle was very different from the narrow definition of modern science. Fuller believed that “principles can never contradict principles,” rather they can inter-accommodate one another.” He argued: “Everything the brain deals with relates to high-frequency thingness. Mind, and mind alone, deals with understanding the interrelationships existing only between and not in any one principle, considered only by itself.” Fuller emphasized: “Principles themselves are often subsets of interrelationships existing only between principles” (Fuller, 1981, pp.158–159). Trans-disciplinary design dialogue could become a process to become conscious of these interrelationships.",

Once human designs are salutogenic, contributing to both human and the planetary health, once they are synergistically linked into cooperative networks at every and across every scale; and once they follow nature’s design principles, humanity will begin to fulfil the full potential of its syntropic role in the universe — the universe becoming fully conscious of itself through humanity’s conscious participation. This is the essence of sustainability — the arrow of evolution arriving in the eternal now of conscious and appropriate participation, responsible co-creation, and creatively adaptive design.",
