These were the intellectual grounds that produced open systems experimentation and a variety of hybrid structures. Organizational models moved away from the notion of an isolated organism, and metaphors based on the ideas of the new science of ecology, came to predominate. Yet the ideals put forth by open systems and ecological thinking were handicapped in practice, not because the models were faulty, but because information technology was inadequate to support the kinds of information flows that the models told them were necessary. Only until the mid 90’s was it possible to explore these models in actual practice — but the scene had already been set a decade before. Not surprisingly, then, organizations evolved at an unprecedented pace.",

          "text": "At the level of rational systems, things get complicated and require better engineering. We can think of engineering as additive. As the assembly line or service route becomes more complicated, we need to add roles, tasks, quality control stations, safety precautions, and other kinds of redundancies. At the level of natural systems, things become more interdependent and complex, requiring more complex systems design. We can think of systems design as multiplicative (or even exponential), because it deals with amplifying forces.",

We need to subtract from the existing complicated path dependencies, and divide out the interdependencies that make systems complex. We need to deconstruct the old assumptions and figure our way into a new way of thinking. Here, sensemaking begins from a fresh starting position where people can reason from first principles and find simple, but powerful protocols for action.",
