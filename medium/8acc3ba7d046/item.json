At least five out of these six factors are directly linked to human planning and design, and the point number five is also strongly indirectly linked to bad design practice. The unrestrained use of anti- bacterial chemicals, pesticides, and antibiotics is now one of the major drivers of microbial adaptation and change.",

In1848, the Prussian physician Rudolf Virchow produced the following list of recommendations in his report on possible measures to respond effectively to a typhus epidemic in Upper Silesia: 1) political reform and local self-government; 2) education; 3) economic reform; 4) agricultural reforms, including the development of cooperatives; 5) road building; 6) requirement that professionals such as teachers and physicians speak the language of the local people. Waltner-Toews emphasizes that even today, such holistic thinking is often still absent from the work of health care officials. He argues: “Those who study disease are not necessarily well-equipped to promote health;” and stresses: “New modes of thought which can incorporate multiple perspectives are required” (Waltner-Toews, 2004, p.12).",

These are necessities for sustaining human health and well-being in the long term. By aiming to provide and maintain these fundamental human needs, salutogenic — or health-generating — design can act as a transdisciplinary integrator that unites expert knowledge from diverse disciplines into a process of local and global cooperation. The salutogenic and local- global scale-linking approach relies on socially and ecologically literate citizens everywhere to make sustainability a reality.",

In my opinion, their co-evolutionary approach to design aims for appropriate participation in natural process and contributes greatly to the theoretical foundation of salutogenic, scale-linking, sustainable design, as well as the emergence of the natural design movement (see chapter 3).

Sterling argues: “From a systems point of view, the health of any system — be it a family, a community, a farm, a local economy, a school, or an ecosystem — depends on the health of its subsystems and they on their subsystems and so on.” Based on this holistic or systemic understanding of health, Sterling defines sustainability as “the ability of a system to sustain itself in relation to its environment, given that all systems are made up of subsystems and parts of larger supra-systems. A system that either undermines the health of its own subsystems or of its supra-system is unsustainable.” Sterling concludes: “Sustainability is therefore about encouraging self sustaining abilities and wholeness between systemic levels” (Sterling, 2001, p.54).",

Therefore, we need to work at creating organizational structures that foster adaptive communication across departmental lines (health, agriculture, economics) … This is not some Utopian Dream we are after. Rather, we are using health as a way of thinking and acting that will allow us, in the words of Rene Dubos, to find ‘a modus vivendi enabling imperfect (people) to achieve a rewarding and not too painful existence while they cope with an imperfect world.’”",

Effective health care systems promote individual, societal and ecological health. They acknowledge that individual and community health improves people’s ability to responsibly participate in their local communities and contribute to the emergence of health at other scales of the interconnected whole. Conventional health care systems too often focus on treating the symptoms of ill-health rather than promoting positive health through salutogenesis. The most effective way towards improving human and planetary health is to establish a scale-linked concerted effort to promote health simultaneously at all scales. Individual health care, community health, healthy food systems, and efforts to restore ecosystem and planetary health need to be integrated across scales.",
