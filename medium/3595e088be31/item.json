          "text": "In over 40 years of ongoing research, Richard Scott derived a schema of organizations he called rational, natural, or open. This research helps contextualize the OPO in a rich history of organizational response to evolving conditions over time. Rational organizations, as Scott describes them, are 1) deliberately constructed, 2) around the coordination of tasks, 3) performed by the cooperation of people, 4) under specified guidelines and formal arrangements, in order to 5) achieve specified goals. It is easy to see that manufacturing is predominated by this kind of organization. Given the complexity of the modern world, however, a new kind of organization evolved — what Scott called the natural organization. The key characteristics of the natural organization is that it is based on 1) collectivities of people, 2) pursuing multiple interests, 3) operating under informal relations, 4) guided by generalized values, in order to 5) perpetuate the organization. In this new form of organization, we see for the first time, emphasis on people and their skills (1); a diverse and oftentimes evolving portfolio of interests, such as manufacturing, franchising, servicing and financing in the automotive industry (2); a shift toward human resource development and career relationships (3); and an emphasis on organizational values as the basis for stability (4). The biggest shift, however, is that the organization is de-coupled from goal-related pursuits, and for the first time we see the notion that the organization has inherent value and that the ultimate purpose is for its indefinite survival. The natural organization derives its sense of inherent value from the sustained corporate culture and ideology, loyalty from employees based on career development in the organization, and loyalty from customers based on brand identity.",

It sees the environment as a resource for raw materials and relies on fairly straight-forward engineering to achieve success. Good engineering guarantees a greater market share — the purpose for which the rational organization exists. In terms of organizational development, we might say that the rational organization is “engineered to control action.” Where the metaphor for the rational organization was the “machine,” the new metaphor for the natural organization is the “organism.” In the natural organization, people are seen as the main resource, not the environment. As a consequence of its ideology of survival, the environment begins to be seen as a threat. The natural organization, like its own metaphor, the organism, is designed to grow and develop, which means becoming more complex. Here, good engineering is not enough — sophisticated complex dynamic and cybernetic systems are required to regulate system-wide control. This is the domain of The Fifth Discipline — described by Peter Senge in his book of the same name. Senge introduced the necessity of perpetual learning, systems thinking, and shared vision into the literature on organizational science. He refers to systems archetypes, ecosystems, and nature’s templates as patterns that control events. He talks about planning as a balancing process that “achieves homeostasis — its ability to maintain conditions for survival in a changing environment.",

No longer were people seen as mere appendages to the machines. Quite the contrary — it was because people and only people could learn that made them even more valuable than machines. Corporations began to invest heavily in their education, training and career development. Human resources were redesigned to support and facilitate learning, which required them to take care of employee’s well-being. These were all positive and meaningful consequences of thinking of the organization in a new light. However, because it is still a structure that is fundamentally closed with respect to the larger society, when the ideology of the natural organization is taken too literally, or “calcified in the rhetoric of managers” and “reified in the minds of subordinates,” the natural organization reveals its darker side.",

          "text": "New theories of management and leadership evolved alongside the natural organization. Managers became increasingly interested in thinking about the organization in terms of complex dynamic systems. They appropriated systems thinking around production and distribution chains, resource flows, and markets into the domain of social interaction. Management theories modelled human groups as if they were complex systems, with specifiable boundaries and complex internal relations. Eventually managers took these models literally, and came to think of human groups as systems that could be controlled from the outside, and steered into preferred directions. In other words, people on the “inside” of the system were free agents who exercised choice in their actions; but from the perspective of the “system” these same people were “de-animated” in the mind of the privileged observer whose responsibility it was to control those actions. People were self-determined at one level, and simultaneously determined by the system at the level of the “whole.” People came to understand their individual agency in part-whole terms, like the difference between the agency of the cells in one’s body, and the agency that the body exercises as a “whole organism.” The goal of management became that of shaping groups of people into teams that behaved less like a diverse array of individual participants, and more like a “whole organism.”",

First, the assumption that managers could occupy a position from which they could leverage the behaviors of a group as a whole. Secondly, the anticipation that people had that a collective phenomenon occurs when as a group, they open to the flow of a higher intelligence. The net effect was that people were focused on a higher level of agency — either one controlled by the laws of dynamic systems, or one controlled by a larger intelligence. People thought of themselves less as self-determined agents, and more as interchangeable parts of a communal field. People didn’t question the models that managers made of them, and as a consequence, entire teams developed a kind of “skilled incompetence.” Furthermore, as part of the communal field, people were expected to share common values and beliefs as well as norms and routines, and as a result, a kind of group think based on strong belonging needs, came to permeate organizational life.",

Consider for example, the difference between a rational organization that designs products for customers, and builds up demand for the products through intensive marketing. The customer is seen as the “target,” and the organization strives to maintain a strong asymmetry of power over the customer. In an open organization, such as an agile tech company, there could be no greater difference. Here the customer is now a “partner” and as a partner, they are engaged as a full participant, directly with the developers, in solving their needs, by importing user stories that represent them into the scrum backlog. Of course, client needs can be experienced as exerting pressure — the adaptive pressure for development, improvement, invention and innovation.\n \n Finally, in the case of closed organizations, the action-logics are those of control and resistance. As an open organization, the action-logics in the OPO are those of flow and resilience. The open organization we have been describing is an “open-natural” organization. The OPO also operates in a fourth, emerging arena. Using Scott’s taxonomy of organizations, the fourth possible type of organization would be “open-rational.” Scott (2003) identifies three axes of analysis in his taxonomy:",

          "text": "Using this framework, Scott places the different organizational types in a historical context. The earliest models were closed-rational-system models that dominated between 1900 and 1930. These included Taylor’s scientific management approach, Weber’s model of bureaucracies, and Fayol’s administrative theories. In the 1930’s and 1950’s, a new paradigm emerged that combined closed-natural-systems models, such as human relations models of Roy and Dalton, Bernard’s structural theory of cooperative systems, and Mayo’s models of human relations. The 1960’s represented a new kind of step — from closed to open systems models, and the metaphor of organism came to dominate organizational theory. Throughout the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s competing theoretical explanations for organizational structure and behavior, produced both closed-natural-systems and open-rational-systems models that were very similar. In more recent times, with the growing interest in complexity science, the open-natural paradigm moved away from classical systems analysis and toward a fuller embrace of the science of self-organization and emergence. In this latter case, not only is the strict boundary between inside and outside abolished, but also the sharp dichotomy between organization and environment is disputed, leading to the adoption of process views such as Weick’s models of HRO (high reliable organizations). Like the OPO, these modern-day models draw heavily on participatory themes such as enactment and sensemaking. \n \n This modern-day paradigm shifts from the metaphor of the organization as an ecology to the metaphor of a platform. We introduced the OPO as a platform. But what do we mean by platform in this context? In a political context, a platform is the declared policy of a party. It could also mean a place for public discussion, in other words, a place for participation, like the Greek notion of the polis. In the context of technology, a platform is the architecture and equipment that enables and supports a particular operating system. In the context of organization, we mean all these things. In the context of complexity science, the term platform can refer to the simple but powerful protocols, from which rich patterns of organization emerge. Depending on our perspective, we point to some of these patterns and call them “organization” and point to others and call them “environment.” In an organizational context, a platform can refer to a set of principles, propositions, and procedures that function as organizing protocols. This is the governance platform of the OPO.\n \n Switching from the metaphor of an ecology where there is the dichotomy of organism and environment in an adaptive process, to the metaphor of platform moves us closer to the meaning of OPO. Here the environment is not the adaptive landscape, but is an outcome of mutual participation. The environment emerges from, or alternately is enacted by the participation of individual agents. The core technology shifts from human dynamics (in the open-natural model) to sensemaking, which includes both human and non-human agents, actors and environment. While the primary purpose shifts from solving complex challenges (provided from the environment) to injecting novelty into the environment. In other words, the purpose in the OPO is enacting novel environments. Finally if the mantra of the open-natural organization is “sensing in order to act;” the mantra for the open-rational organization becomes “acting in order to make sense.” This represents the distinction between two types of environments — one in which sensemaking operates through narrative based decision rationality, and one in which making sense of things operates through action based retrospective justification. It is precisely in between these arenas, the OPO thrives. In between environments where complex adaptive processes are key to solving complex challenges, and environments where complex responsive processes inject novelty into complex environments — in between sensing in order to act as opposed to acting in order to make sense.",
