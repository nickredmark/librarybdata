I mean, I was out there sure that we were going to transform the world and do it next week if we could just think and push hard enough. And that was a lot of my, you know, I was out organizing things at Stanford around the Vietnam War and in 1962 nobody had even heard of it at that point in our area.

That took on a tangibility for me that I had never really experienced before. So that was my entry to this work.

And it took me a couple of years to figure that out. Because the institute I worked with was focused around business. That was the way to get involved.

And so both of them in very different ways; Tony with this world systems map that you can see behind me there and with the work with Three Horizons and all the frameworks that are curated within H3 Union and the International Futures Forum gave me so much.

But it’s where you have friends in the work who gathered together who have a similar understanding and not necessarily all infects better if they’re not all at the same level. It’s like learning tennis you want to practice with somebody better than you, but you also gain by helping along somebody who’s resourcing somebody who’s coming along behind.

We just go back and forth and build force or end up compromising down. But in the three forces, there’s a third force. That’s the reconciling. And that is the one that if we can appreciate both of the restraining and the activating force hold that cognitive dissonance and really appreciate what is the purpose behind each.

A good Harmony means every single element is playing its role in a beautiful composition. So, you’ve got the opportunity to work regionally to do what essentially we did for in Regenesis. We spent years trying out, developing, testing, learning and coming back and trying out on the ground. And if I thought about the larger-scale impact of that, especially in the early years it wasn’t that great until we began to realize that we need to be working at both levels. And that was when we set up the Institute in 2012 as a way of starting moving towards that aspect.",

I know it is a lot of wisdom but with a few more years of experience to reflect back on, is that yes that is true and it does not excuse us from continuously working to bring more intelligence and more understanding to every interaction and engagement. To actually actualizing something, committing to bringing something into being. So, I think that it is like a both-and. We can shift the energy field that we are working in when we are able to bring and sustain that nature of state and consciousness.

And so, in terms of taking care of kinships — the river and the salmon and so on — the culture you develop reinforces that and gives people the support and guidance without laying down regulations and hard policies. You continuously reinforce it from a ‘being’ level out. And so that cultural piece is really critical. And is one of the things we are also working on, for people being able to be more explicit and conscious about what are the dimensions of the culture that you really need to pay attention to because they are signs of what the underlying belief is that maybe long dead and frozen and no longer accurate abut it is still dominant.",
