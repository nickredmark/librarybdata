Commitments:

* I choose the path of Sovereignty.  I choose to take full responsibility for myself in relationship with myself, other people and the world.  I accept that this path is never ending and that the simple choice to undertake it is the first of many (often challenging) steps.
* I choose to always endeavor to find the highest and best relationship with all others.  I will seek to find a way of being in relationship that elevates both their Sovereignty and my own Sovereignty ongoingly.
* I will apply Rules Alpha and Omega in my relationships with all who are in earnest and are in good faith trying to play game~b.
* I will treat this community with respect and care.
* I will take the time and undertake the effort necessary to realize these Commitments without compromise or excuse.
* I understand that we are all learning and that this thing is hard.  I will practice compassion, humility and forgiveness for myself and others.

Principles:

* The Principle of Curiosity.  Curiosity before knowing.  If you already know how to do this thing, please just do it (elsewhere).  This is not a place to market your program or beat the drum of your preferred ideology.  It is a place where people can come and explore how to step into this new possibility themselves.  A primary virtue, therefore, is curiosity.  Be curious and play with curiosity.
* The Principle of Discernment. Learn how to listen carefully.  Both to find the signal and upregulate it and to find the noise and downregulate it.  The effort here is more about building capacity in Discernment than in trying to get to the “truth” or the “right answer” in this Facebook group.  This is more of a place of practice than of content.
* The Principle of Focus.  Focus on game~b.  There is a fundamental assumption here that Game A and game~b are different and that Game A is not “the way”.  Accordingly, this is not a place for trying to play Game A better.  This is not a place to discuss Game A politics, policies or current events.  This is a place to begin to learn how to play game~b. It can actually be quite hard leaving the buzz and salience of the Game A world behind.  Practice focus.
